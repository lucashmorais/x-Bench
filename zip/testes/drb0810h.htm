<h1>Book 08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth</h1>
<br><br>




<p>THE BOOK OF RUTH</p>

<p>This Book is called RUTH, from the name of the person whose history is<br>
here recorded: who, being a Gentile, became a convert to the true faith,<br>
and marrying Booz, the great-grandfather of David, was one of those from<br>
whom Christ sprung according to the flesh, and an illustrious figure of<br>
the Gentile church. It is thought this book was written by the prophet<br>
Samuel.</p>

<p>
Ruth Chapter 1</p>

<p>Elimelech of Bethlehem going with his wife Noemi, and two sons, into the<br>
land of Moab, dieth there. His sons marry wives of that country and die<br>
without issue. Noemi returneth home with her daughter in law Ruth, who<br>
refuseth to part with her.</p>

<p>1:1. In the days of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a<br>
famine in the land. &nbsp;And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to<br>
sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.</p>

<p>1:2. He was named Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the<br>
one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And<br>
entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.</p>

<p>1:3. And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her<br>
sons.</p>

<p>1:4. And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called<br>
Orpha, and the other Ruth. &nbsp;And they dwelt their ten years,</p>

<p>1:5. And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was<br>
left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.</p>

<p>1:6. And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with<br>
both her daughters in law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked<br>
upon his people, and had given them food.</p>

<p>1:7. Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with<br>
both her daughters in law: and being now in the way to return into the<br>
land of Juda,</p>

<p>1:8. She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal<br>
mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</p>

<p>1:9. May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom<br>
you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and<br>
began to weep,</p>

<p>1:10. And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.</p>

<p>1:11. But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me?<br>
have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?</p>

<p>1:12. Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent<br>
with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night,<br>
and bear children,</p>

<p>1:13. If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man's<br>
estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my<br>
daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress,<br>
and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.</p>

<p>1:14. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha<br>
kissed her mother in law, and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother<br>
in law.</p>

<p>1:15. And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her<br>
people, and to her gods, go thou with her.</p>

<p>To her gods, etc... Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the<br>
false gods she had formerly worshipped: but by this manner of speech,<br>
insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her<br>
false gods and return to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>

<p>1:16. She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave<br>
thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where<br>
thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and<br>
thy God my God.</p>

<p>1:17. The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die:<br>
and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more<br>
also, if aught but death part me and thee.</p>

<p>The Lord do so and so, etc... A form of swearing usual in the history of<br>
the Old Testament, by which the person wished such and such evils to<br>
fall upon them, if they did not do what they said.</p>

<p>1:18. Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with<br>
her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her<br>
friends:</p>

<p>1:l9. So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. &nbsp;And when they were<br>
come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the<br>
women said: This is that Noemi.</p>

<p>1:20. But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful,) but<br>
call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me<br>
with bitterness.</p>

<p>1:21. I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then<br>
do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath<br>
afflicted?</p>

<p>1:22. So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter in law, from<br>
the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the<br>
beginning of the barley harvest.</p>

<p>Ruth Chapter 2</p>

<p>Ruth gleaneth in the field of Booz, who sheweth her favour.</p>

<p>2:1. Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very<br>
rich, whose name was Booz.</p>

<p>2:3. And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I<br>
will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands<br>
of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder, that<br>
will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.</p>

<p>2:3. She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the<br>
reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was<br>
of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>

<p>2:4. And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The<br>
Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.</p>

<p>2:5. And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose<br>
maid is this?</p>

<p>2:6. And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi,<br>
from the land of Moab,</p>

<p>2:7. And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain,<br>
following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from<br>
morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.</p>

<p>2:8. And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any<br>
other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,</p>

<p>2:9. And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to<br>
molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of<br>
the waters whereof the servants drink.</p>

<p>2:l0. She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to<br>
him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes,<br>
and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a woman of<br>
another country?</p>

<p>2:11. And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to<br>
thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left<br>
thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a<br>
people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>

<p>2:12. The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a<br>
full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and<br>
under whose wings thou art fled.</p>

<p>2:13. And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast<br>
comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not<br>
like to one of thy maids.</p>

<p>2:14. And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the<br>
bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the<br>
reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and<br>
took the leavings.</p>

<p>2:15. And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before.<br>
And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with<br>
you, hinder her not:</p>

<p>2:16. And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them,<br>
that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when<br>
she gathereth them.</p>

<p>2:17. She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out<br>
with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the<br>
measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:</p>

<p>2:18. Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to<br>
her mother in law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the<br>
remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.</p>

<p>2:19. And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned today,<br>
and where hast thou wrought? &nbsp;blessed be he that hath had pity on thee.<br>
And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man's name,<br>
that he was called Booz.</p>

<p>2:20. And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the<br>
same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the<br>
dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.</p>

<p>2:21. And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his<br>
reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.</p>

<p>2:22. And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my<br>
daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man's field<br>
some one may resist thee.</p>

<p>2:23. So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean<br>
with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns.</p>

<p>Ruth Chapter 3</p>

<p>Ruth instructed by her mother in law lieth at Booz's feet, claiming him<br>
for her husband by the law of affinity: she receiveth a good answer, and<br>
six measures of barley.</p>

<p>3:1. After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My<br>
daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be<br>
well with thee.</p>

<p>3:2. This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our<br>
near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the<br>
threshingfloor.</p>

<p>3:3. Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best<br>
garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee,<br>
till he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>

<p>3:4. And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth:<br>
and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered<br>
towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell<br>
thee what thou must do.</p>

<p>3:5. She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.</p>

<p>3:6. And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in<br>
law had bid her.</p>

<p>3:7. And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep<br>
by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet,<br>
laid herself down.</p>

<p>3:8. And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and<br>
troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,</p>

<p>3:9. And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy<br>
handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near<br>
kinsman.</p>

<p>3:10. And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy<br>
latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed<br>
young men either poor or rich.</p>

<p>Thy latter kindness, viz... to thy husband deceased in seeking to keep<br>
up his name and family by marrying his relation according to the law,<br>
and not following after young men. For Booz, it seems, was then in<br>
years.</p>

<p>3:11. Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do<br>
to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know<br>
that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>

<p>3:12. Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another<br>
nearer than I.</p>

<p>3:13. Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take<br>
thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will<br>
undoubtedly take thee, so the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.</p>

<p>3:14. So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she<br>
arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any<br>
man know that thou camest hither.</p>

<p>3:15. And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered,<br>
and hold it with both hands. &nbsp;And when she spread it and held it, he<br>
measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried<br>
it, and went into the city,</p>

<p>3:16. And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou<br>
done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>

<p>3:17. And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for<br>
he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.</p>

<p>3:18. And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing<br>
will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he<br>
hath said.</p>

<p>Ruth Chapter 4</p>

<p>Upon the refusal of the nearer kinsman, Booz marrieth Ruth, who bringeth<br>
forth Obed, the grandfather of David.</p>

<p>4:1 Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. &nbsp;And when he had seen<br>
the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him,<br>
calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down<br>
here. He turned aside, and sat down.</p>

<p>4:2. And Booz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them:<br>
Sit ye down here.</p>

<p>4:3. They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned<br>
from the country of Moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our<br>
brother Elimelech.</p>

<p>4:4. I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before<br>
all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt<br>
take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it:<br>
but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to<br>
do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me,<br>
who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.</p>

<p>4:5. And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman's<br>
hand, thou must take also Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of the<br>
deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.</p>

<p>4:6. He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut<br>
off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege,<br>
which I profess I do willingly forego.</p>

<p>4:7. Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen,<br>
that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant<br>
might be sure, the man put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour;<br>
this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.</p>

<p>4:8. So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he<br>
took it off from his foot.</p>

<p>4:9. And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are<br>
witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and<br>
Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi:</p>

<p>4:10. And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon,<br>
to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be<br>
cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I<br>
say, are witnesses of this thing.</p>

<p>4:11. Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients,<br>
answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy<br>
house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she<br>
may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in<br>
Bethlehem:</p>

<p>Ephrata... Another name of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>4:12. And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar<br>
bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young<br>
woman.</p>

<p>4:13. Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her,<br>
and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.</p>

<p>4:14. And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not<br>
suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be<br>
preserved in Israel.</p>

<p>4:15. And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy<br>
old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is<br>
much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.</p>

<p>4:16. And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried<br>
it, and was a nurse unto it.</p>

<p>4:17. And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and<br>
saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the<br>
father of Isai, the father of David.</p>

<p>4:18. These are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esron,</p>

<p>4:19. Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,</p>

<p>4:20. Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,</p>

<p>4:21. Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,</p>

<p>4:22. Obed begot Isai, Isai begot David.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
