<b>DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF EDRIOPHTHALMA</b></center>

<br>
<br>
 

<p class="one">Less varied than that of the Stalk-eyed Crustacea is
the mode of development of the Isopoda and Amphipoda, which Leach
united in the section Edriophthalma, or Crustacea with sessile
eyes.</p>

<p>The Rock-Slaters (<i>Ligia</i>) may serve as an example of the
development of the Isopoda. In these, as in <i>Mysis,</i> the
caudal portion of the embryo is bent not downwards, but upwards; as
in <i>Mysis</i> also, a larval membrane is first of all formed,
within which the Slater is developed. In <i>Mysis</i> this first
larval skin may be compared to a Nauplius; in <i>Ligia</i> it
appears like a maggot quite destitute of appendages, but produced
into a long simple tail (Fig. 37). The egg-membrane is retained
longer than in <i>Mysis</i>; it bursts only when the limbs of the
young Slater are already partially developed in their full number.
The dorsal surface of the Slater is united to the larval skin a
little behind the head. At this point, when the union has been
dissolved a little before the change of skin, there is a foliaceous
appendage, which exists only for a short time, and disappears
before the young Slater quits the brood-pouch of the mother.</p>

remains of the egg-membrane. We see on the lower surface, from
before backwards:&mdash;the anterior and posterior antenn&aelig;,
the mandibles, the anterior and posterior maxill&aelig;,
maxillipedes, six ambulatory feet, the last segment of the
middle-body destitute of appendages, five abdominal feet, and the
caudal feet.</p>

<br>
<p>The young animal, when it begins to take care of itself,
resembles the old ones in almost all parts, except one important
difference; it possesses only six, instead of seven pairs of
ambulatory feet; and the last segment of the middle-body is but
slightly developed and destitute of appendages. It need hardly be
mentioned that the sexual peculiarities are not yet developed, and
that in the males the hand-like enlargements of the anterior
ambulatory feet and the copulatory appendages are still
deficient.</p>

<p>To the question, how far the development of <i>Ligia</i> is
repeated in the other Isopoda, I can only give an unsatisfactory
answer. The curvature of the embryo upwards instead of downwards
was met with by me as well as by Rathke in <i>Idothea,</i> and
likewise in <i>Cassidina, Philoscia, Tanais,</i> and the
Bopyrid&aelig;,&mdash;indeed, I failed to find it in none of the
Isopoda examined for this purpose. In <i>Cassidina</i> also the
first larval skin without appendages is easily detected; it is
destitute of the long tail, but is strongly bent in the egg, as in
<i>Ligia,</i> and consequently cannot be mistaken for an
&ldquo;inner egg-membrane.&rdquo; This, however, might happen in
<i>Philoscia,</i> in which the larval skin is closely applied to
the egg-membrane (Fig. 38), and is only to be explained as the
larval skin by a reference to <i>Ligia</i> and <i>Cassidina.</i>
The foliaceous appendage on the back has long been known in the
young of the common Water Slater (<i>Asellus</i>).<a href=
"#1."><sup>1</sup></a> That the last pair of feet of the thorax is
wanting in the young of the Wood-lice (<i>Porcellionides,</i>
M.-Edw.) and Fish-lice (<i>Cymothoadiens,</i> M.-Edw.) has already
been noticed by Milne-Edwards. This applies also to the Box-Slaters
(<i>Idothea</i>), to the viviparous Globe-Slaters
(<i>Sph&aelig;roma</i>) and Shield-Slaters (<i>Cassidina</i>), to
the Bopyrid&aelig; (<i>Bopyrus, Entoniscus, Cryptoniscus,</i>
n.g.), and to the Cheliferous Slaters (<i>Tanais</i>), and
therefore probably to the great majority of the Isopoda. All the
other limbs are usually well developed in the young Isopoda. In <i>
Tanais</i> alone, all the abdominal feet are wanting (but not those
of the tail); they are developed simultaneously with the last pair
of feet of the thorax.</p>

Fig. 40. Last foot of the middle-body of the larva of <i>Entoniscus
Porcellan&aelig;,</i> magnified.</p>

<br>
<p>The last pair of feet on the middle-body of the larva,
consequently the penultimate pair in the adult animal, is almost
always similar in structure to the preceding pair. A remarkable
exception is, however, presented in this respect by <i>
Cryptoniscus</i> and <i>Entoniscus,</i>&mdash;remarkable as a
confirmation of Darwin&rsquo;s proposition that &ldquo;parts
developed in an unusual manner are very variable,&rdquo; for in the
peculiarly-formed pair of feet there exists the greatest possible
difference between the three species hitherto observed. In <i>
Cryptoniscus</i> (Fig. 39) this last foot is thin and rod-like; in
<i>Entoniscus Cancrorum</i> remarkably long and furnished with a
strongly thickened hand and a peculiarly constructed chela; in <i>
Entoniscus Porcellan&aelig;</i> very short, imperfectly jointed,
and with a large ovate terminal joint (Fig. 40).</p>

<p>Some Isopods undergo a considerable change immediately before
the attainment of sexual maturity. This is the case with the males
of <i>Tanais</i> which have already been noticed, and, according to
Hesse, with the <i>Praniz&aelig;,</i> in which both sexes are said
to pass into the form known as <i>Anceus.</i> But Spence Bate, a
careful observer, states that he has seen females of the form of
<i>Praniza</i> laden with eggs far advanced in their
development.</p>

<br>
<p>In this order we meet for the first time with an extensive
retrograde metamorphosis as a consequence of a parasitic mode of
life. Even in some Fish-lice (<i>Cymothoa</i>) the young are lively
swimmers, and the adults stiff, stupid, heavy fellows, whose short
clinging feet are capable of but little movement. In the
Bopyrid&aelig; (<i>Bopyrus, Phryxus, Kepone,</i> etc., which might
have been conveniently left in a single genus), which are parasitic
on Crabs, Lobsters, etc., taking up their abode chiefly in the
branchial cavity, the adult females are usually quite destitute of
eyes; the antenn&aelig; are rudimentary; the broad body is
frequently unsymmetrically developed in consequence of the confined
space; its segments are more or less amalgamated with each other;
the feet are stunted, and the appendages of the abdomen transformed
from natatory feet with long set&aelig; into foliaceous or
tongue-shaped and sometimes ramified branchi&aelig;. In the
dwarfish males the eyes, antenn&aelig;, and feet, are usually
better preserved than in the females; but on the other hand all the
appendages of the abdomen have not unfrequently disappeared, and
sometimes every trace of segmentation. In the females of <i>
Entoniscus,</i> which are found in the body-cavity of Crabs and <i>
Porcellan&aelig;,</i> the eyes, antenn&aelig;, and buccal organs,
the segmentation of the vermiform body, and in one species (Fig.
41) the whole of the limbs, disappear almost without leaving a
trace; and <i>Cryptoniscus planarioides</i> would almost be
regarded as a Flatworm rather than an Isopod, if its eggs and young
did not betray its Crustacean nature. Among the males of these
various Bopyrid&aelig;, that of <i>Entoniscus Porcellan&aelig;</i>
occupies the lowest place; it is confined all its life to six pairs
of feet, which are reduced to shapeless rounded lumps.</p>

<p>The Amphipoda are distinguishable from the Isopoda at an early
period in the egg by the different position of the embryo, the
hinder extremity of which is bent downwards. In all the animals of
this order which have been examined for it,<a href=
"#2."><sup>2</sup></a> a peculiar structure makes its appearance
very early on the anterior part of the back, by which the embryo is
attached to the &ldquo;inner egg-membrane,&rdquo; and which has
been called the &ldquo;micropylar apparatus,&rdquo; but improperly
as it seems to me.<a href="#3."><sup>3</sup></a> It will remind us
of the union of the young Isopoda with the larval membrane and of
the unpaired &ldquo;adherent organ&rdquo; on the nape of the
Cladocera, which is remarkably developed in <i>Evadne</i> and
persists throughout life; but in <i>Daphnia pulex,</i> according to
Leydig, although present in the young animals, disappears without
leaving a trace in the adults.</p>

<p>The young animal, whilst still in the egg, acquires the full
number of its segments and limbs. In cases where segments are
amalgamated together, such as the last two segments of the thorax
in <i>Dulichia,</i> the last abdominal segments and the tail in <i>
Gammarus ambulans</i> and <i>Corophium dentatum,</i> n. sp., and
the last abdominal segments and the tail in <i>Brachyscelus,</i><a
href="#4."><sup>4</sup></a> or where one or more segments are
deficient, as in <i>Dulichia</i> and the <i>Caprell&aelig;,</i> we
find the same fusion and the same deficiencies in young animals
taken out of the brood-pouch of their mother. Even peculiarities in
the structure of the limbs, so far as they are common to both
sexes, are usually well-marked in the newly hatched young, so that
the latter generally differ from their parents only by their
stouter form, the smaller number of the antennal joints and
olfactory filaments, and also of the set&aelig; and teeth with
which the body or feet are armed, and perhaps by the comparatively
larger size of the secondary flagellum. An exception to this rule
is presented by the Hyperin&aelig; which usually live upon
Acaleph&aelig;. In these the young and adults often have a
remarkably different appearance; but even in these there is no new
formation of body-segments and limbs, but only a gradual
transformation of these parts.<a href="#5."><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="capt">Figs. 44&ndash;46. Feet of a half-grown Hyperia
Martinezii, n. sp. (Named after my valued friend the amiable
Spanish zoologist, M. Francisco de Paula Martinez y Saes, at
present on a voyage round the world.)<br>
Figs. 47&ndash;49. Feet of a nearly adult male of the same species;
44 and 47 from the first pair of anterior feet (gnathopoda); 44 and
48 from the first, and 46 and 49 from the last pair of thoracic
feet. Magnified.</p>

<br>
<p>Thus, in order to give a few examples, the powerful chel&aelig;
of the antepenultimate pair of feet, of <i>Phromina sedentaria,</i>
are produced, according to Pagenstecher, from simple feet of
ordinary structure; and <i>vice vers&agrave;,</i> the chel&aelig;
on the penultimate pair of feet of the young <i>Brachyscelus,</i>
become converted into simple feet. In the young of the
last-mentioned genus the long head is drawn out into a conical
point and bears remarkably small eyes; in course of growth, the
latter, as in most of the Hyperin&aelig;, attain an enormous size,
and almost entirely occupy the head, which then appears spherical,
etc.</p>

<p>The difference of the sexes which, in the Gammarin&aelig; is
usually expressed chiefly in the structure of the anterior feet
(gnathopoda, Sp. Bate) and in the Hyperin&aelig; in the structure
of the antenn&aelig;, is often so great that males and females have
been described as distinct species, and even repeatedly placed in
different genera (<i>Orchestia</i> and <i>Talitrus, Cerapus</i> and
<i>Dercotho&euml;, Lestrigonus</i> and <i>Hyperia</i>) or even
families (<i>Hyp&eacute;rines anormales</i> and <i>Hyp&eacute;rines
ordinaires</i>). Nevertheless it is only developed when the animals
are nearly full-grown. Up to this period the young resemble the
females in a general way, even in some cases in which these differ
more widely than the males from the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; of the
order. Thus in the male Shore-hoppers (<i>Orchestia</i>) the second
pair of the anterior feet is provided with a powerful hand, as in
the majority of the Amphipoda, but very differently constructed in
the females. The young, nevertheless, resemble the female. Thus
also,&mdash;and this is an extremely rare case,<a href=
"#6."><sup>6</sup></a>&mdash;the females of <i>Brachyscelus</i> are
destitute of the posterior (or inferior) antenn&aelig;; the male
possesses them like other Amphipod&aelig;; in the young I, like
Spence Bate, can find no trace of them.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be particularly remarked, that the
development of the sexual peculiarities does not stand still on the
attainment of sexual maturity.</p>

<p>For example, the younger sexually mature males of <i>Orchestia
Tucurauna,</i> n. sp., have slender inferior antenn&aelig;, with
the joints of the flagellum not fused together, the clasping margin
(&ldquo;palm,&rdquo; Sp. Bate) of the hand in the second pair of
feet is uniformly convex, the last pair of feet is slender and
similar to the preceding. Subsequently the antenn&aelig; become
thickened, two, three, or four of the first joints of the flagellum
are fused together, the palm of the hand acquires a deep
emargination near its inferior angle, and the intermediate joints
of the last pair of feet become swelled into a considerable
incrassation. No museum-zoologist would hesitate about fabricating
two distinct species, if the oldest and youngest sexually mature
males were sent to him without the uniting intermediate forms. In
the younger males of <i>Orchestia Tucuratinga,</i> although the
microscopic examination of their testes showed that they were
already sexually mature, the emargination of the clasping margin of
the hand (represented in Fig. 50) and the corresponding process of
the finger, are still entirely wanting. The same may be observed in
<i>Cerapus</i> and <i>Caprella,</i> and probably in all cases where
hereditary sexual differences occur.</p>

<br>
<p>Next to the extensive sections of the Stalk-eyed and
Sessile-eyed Crustacea, but more nearly allied to the former than
to the latter, comes the remarkable family of the <i>
Diastylid&aelig;</i> or <i>Cumacea.</i> The young, which
Kr&ouml;yer took out of the brood-pouch of the female, and which
attained one-fourth of the length of their mother, resembled the
adult animals almost in all parts. Whether, as in <i>Mysis</i> and
<i>Ligia,</i> a transformation occurs within the brood-pouch, which
is constructed in the same way as in <i>Mysis,</i> is not known.<a
href="#7."><sup>7</sup></a> The caudal portion of the embryo in the
<i>Diastylid&aelig;,</i> as I have recently observed, is curved
upwards as in the Isopoda, and the last pair of feet of the thorax
is wanting.</p>

<p>Equally scanty is our knowledge of the developmental history of
the Ostracoda. We know scarcely anything except that their anterior
limbs are developed before the posterior one (Zenker). The
development of <i>Cypris</i> has recently been observed by
Claus:&mdash;&ldquo;The youngest stages are shell-bearing
Nauplius-forms.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fnote"><a name="1.">1.</a> Leydig has compared this
foliaceous appendage of the Water Slaters with the &ldquo;green
gland&rdquo; or &ldquo;shell-gland&rdquo; of other crustacea,
assuming that the green gland has no efferent duct and appealing to
the fact that the two organs occur &ldquo;in the same place.&rdquo;
This interpretation is by no means a happy one. In the first place
we may easily ascertain in <i>Leucifer,</i> as was also found to be
the case by Claus, that the &ldquo;green gland&rdquo; really opens
at the end of the process described by Milne-Edwards as a
&ldquo;tubercule auditif&rdquo; and by Spence Bate as an
&ldquo;olfactory denticle.&rdquo; And, secondly, the position is
about as different as it can well be. In the one case a paired
gland, opening at the base of the posterior antenn&aelig;, and
therefore on the lower surface of the <i>second</i> segment; in the
other an unpaired structure rising in the median line of the back
<i>behind the seventh segment,</i> (&ldquo;behind the boundary line
of the first thoracic segment,&rdquo; Leydig).<br>
<a name="2.">2.</a> In the genera <i>Orchestoidea, Orchestia,
Allorchestes, Montagua, Batea</i> n.g., <i>Amphilochus, Atylus,
Microdeutopus, Leucotho&euml;, Melita, Gammarus</i> (according to
Meissner and La Valette), <i>Amphitho&euml;, Cerapus, Cyrtophium,
Corophium, Dulichia, Protella</i> and <i>Caprella.</i><br>
<a name="3.">3.</a> Little as a name may actually affect the facts,
we ought certainly to confine the name &ldquo;micropyle&rdquo; to
canals of the egg-membrane, which serve for the entrance of the
semen. But the outer egg-membrane passes over the &ldquo;micropylar
apparatus&rdquo; of the Amphipoda without any perforation,
according to Meissner&rsquo;s and La Valette&rsquo;s own
statements; it appears never to be present before fecundation,
attains its greatest development at a subsequent period of the
ovular life, and the delicate canals which penetrate it do not even
seem to be always present, indeed it seems to belong to the embryo
rather than to the egg-membrane. I have never been able to convince
myself that the so-called &ldquo;inner egg-membrane&rdquo; is
really of this nature, and not perhaps the earliest larva skin, not
formed until after impregnation, as might be supposed with
reference to <i>Ligia, Cassidina</i> and <i>Philoscia.</i><br>
<a name="4.">4.</a> According to Spence Bate, in <i>Brachyscelus
crusculum</i> the fifth abdominal segment is not amalgamated with
the sixth (the tail) but with the fourth, which I should be
inclined to doubt, considering the close agreement which this
species otherwise shows with the two species that I have
investigated.<br>
<a name="5.">5.</a> In the young of <i>Hyperia galba</i> Spence
Bate did not find any of the abdominal feet, or the last two pairs
of thoracic feet, but this very remarkable statement required
confirmation the more because he examined these minute animals only
in the dried state. Subsequently I had the wished-for opportunity
of tracing the development of a <i>Hyperia</i> which is not
uncommon upon Ctenophora, especially <i>Bero&euml; gilva,</i>
Eschsch. The youngest larva from the brood-pouch of the mother
already possess <i>the whole</i> of the thoracic feet; on the other
hand, like Spence Bate, I cannot find those of the abdomen. At
first simple enough, all these feet soon become converted, like the
anterior feet, into richly denticulated prehensile feet, and indeed
of three different forms, the anterior feet (Fig. 44) the two
following pairs (Fig. 45) and finally the three last pairs (Fig.
46) being similarly constructed and different from the rest. In
this form the feet remain for a very long time, whilst the
abdominal appendages grow into powerful natatory organs, and the
eyes, which at first seemed to me to be wanting, into large
hemispheres. In the transition to the form of the adult animal the
last three pairs of feet (Fig. 49) especially undergo a
considerable change. The difference between the two sexes is
considerable; the females are distinguished by a very broad thorax,
and the males (<i>Lestrigonus</i>) by very long antenn&aelig;, of
which the anterior bear an unusual abundance of olfactory
filaments.<br>
</p>

<p class="fnpar">Their youngest larv&aelig; of course cannot swim;
they are helpless little animals which firmly cling especially to
the swimming lamin&aelig; of their host; the adult <i>
Hyperi&aelig;,</i> which are not unfrequently met with free in the
sea, are, as is well known, the most admirable swimmers in their
order. (&ldquo;Il nage avec une rapidit&eacute;
extr&ecirc;me,&rdquo; says Van Beneden of <i>H. Latreillii</i>
M.-Edw.)<br>
</p>

<p class="fnpar">The transformation of the <i>Hyperi&aelig;</i> is
evidently to be regarded as <i>acquired</i> and not <i>
inherited,</i> that is to say the late appearance of the abdominal
appendages and the peculiar structure of the feet in the young are
not to be brought into unison with the historical development of
the Amphipoda, but to be placed to the account of the parasitic
mode of life of the young.<br>
</p>

<p class="fnpar">As in <i>Brachyscelus,</i> free locomotion has
been continued to the adult and not to the young, contrary to the
usual method among parasites. Still more remarkable is a similar
circumstance in <i>Caligus,</i> among the parasitic Copepoda. The
young animal, described by Burmeister as a peculiar genus, <i>
Chalimus,</i> lies at anchor upon a fish by means of a cable
springing from its forehead, and having its extremity firmly seated
in the skin of the fish. When sexual maturity is attained, the
cable is cut, and the adult <i>Caligi,</i> which are admirable
swimmers, are not unfrequently captured swimming freely in the sea.
(See &lsquo;Archiv. f&uuml;r Naturgeschichte&rsquo; 1852, I. p.
91).<br>
<a name="6.">6.</a> &ldquo;I know of no case in which the inferior
(antenn&aelig;) are obsolete, when the superior are
developed,&rdquo; Dana. (Darwin, &lsquo;Monograph on the Subclass
Cirripedia, Lepadid&aelig;&rsquo; p. 15.)<br>
<a name="7.">7.</a> A trustworthy English Naturalist, Goodsir,
described the brood-pouch and eggs of <i>Cuma</i> as early as 1843.
Kr&ouml;yer, whose painstaking care and conscientiousness is
recognised with wonder by every one who has met him on a common
field of work, confirmed Goodsir&rsquo;s statements in 1846, and,
as above mentioned, took out of the brood-pouch embryos advanced in
development and resembling their parents. By this the question
whether the Diastylid&aelig; are full-grown animals or larv&aelig;,
is completely and for ever set at rest, and only the famous names
of Agassiz, Dana and Milne-Edwards, who would recently reduce them
again to larv&aelig; (see Van Beneden, &lsquo;Rech. sur la Fauna
littor. de Belgique&rsquo; Crustac&eacute;es, pp. 73, 74), induce
me, on the basis of numerous investigations of my own, to declare
in Van Beneden&rsquo;s words; &ldquo;Parmi toutes les formes
embryonnaires de podophthalmes ou d&rsquo;&eacute;driophthalmes que
nous avons observ&eacute;es sur nos c&ocirc;tes, nous n&rsquo;en
avons pas vu une seule qui e&ucirc;t m&ecirc;me la moindre
resemblance avec un <i>Cuma</i> quelconque.&rdquo; The <i>only
thing</i> that suits the larv&aelig; of <i>Hippolyte,
Pal&aelig;mon</i> and <i>Alpheus,</i> in the family character of
the Cumacea as given by Kr&ouml;yer which occupies three pages
(Kr&ouml;yer, &lsquo;Naturh. Tidsskrift, Ny Raekke,&rsquo; Bd. ii.
pp. 203&ndash;206) is: &ldquo;Duo antennarum paria.&rdquo; And
this, as is well known, applies to nearly all Crustacea. How well
warranted are we therefore in identifying the latter with the
former. However, it is sufficient for any one to glance at the
larva of <i>Pal&aelig;mon</i> (<a href="chap7.html#Fig.27">Fig. 27</a>) and the Cumacean (<a href="#Fig.52">Fig. 52</a>) in
order to be convinced of their extraordinary similarity!</p>
