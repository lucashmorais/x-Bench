<p>THE BOOK OF JOSUE</p>

<p>This Book is called JOSUE, because it contains the history of what<br>
passed under him, and according to the common opinion was written by<br>
him. The Greeks call him Jesus: for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew, are<br>
the same name, and have the same signification, viz., A SAVIOUR. And it<br>
was not without a mystery that he who was to bring the people into the<br>
land of promise should have his name changed from OSEE (for so he was<br>
called before, Num. 13.17,) to JOSUE or JESUS, to give us to understand,<br>
that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the<br>
promised inheritance, but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into<br>
it.</p>

<p>
Josue Chapter 1</p>

<p>Josue, encouraged by the Lord, admonisheth the people to prepare<br>
themselves to pass over the Jordan.</p>

<p>1:1. Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the<br>
Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue, the son of Nun, the minister of<br>
Moses, and said to him:</p>

<p>1:2. Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou<br>
and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the<br>
children of Israel.</p>

<p>1:3. I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall<br>
tread upon, as I have said to Moses.</p>

<p>1:4. From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates,<br>
all the land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going down<br>
of the sun, shall be your border.</p>

<p>1:5. No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I<br>
have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor<br>
forsake thee.</p>

<p>1:6. Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this<br>
people the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver<br>
it to them.</p>

<p>1:7. Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst<br>
observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee:<br>
turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst<br>
understand all things which thou dost.</p>

<p>1:8. Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt<br>
meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things<br>
that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand<br>
it.</p>

<p>1:9. Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and<br>
be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things<br>
whatsoever thou shalt go to.</p>

<p>1:10. And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass<br>
through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:</p>

<p>1:11. Prepare your victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over<br>
the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God<br>
will give you.</p>

<p>1:12. And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe<br>
of Manasses:</p>

<p>1:13. Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded<br>
you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.</p>

<p>1:14. Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land<br>
which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed<br>
before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for<br>
them,</p>

<p>1:15. Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you,<br>
and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them:<br>
and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall<br>
dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the<br>
Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>1:16. And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast<br>
commanded us, we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will<br>
go.</p>

<p>1:17. As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only<br>
be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>

<p>1:18. He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that<br>
thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do<br>
manfully.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 2</p>

<p>Two spies are sent to Jericho, who are received and concealed by Rahab.</p>

<p>2:1. And Josue, the son of Nun, sent from Setim two men, to spy<br>
secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of<br>
Jericho. They went, and entered into the house of a woman that was a<br>
harlot, named Rahab, and lodged with her.</p>

<p>2:2. And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said: Behold there are<br>
men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the<br>
land.</p>

<p>2:3. And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men<br>
that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies,<br>
and are come to view all the land.</p>

<p>2:4. And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they<br>
came to me, but I knew not whence they were:</p>

<p>2:5. And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went<br>
out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them<br>
quickly, and you will overtake them.</p>

<p>2:6. But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered<br>
them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</p>

<p>2:7. Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that<br>
leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out,<br>
the gate was presently shut.</p>

<p>2:8. The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the woman<br>
went up to them, and said:</p>

<p>2:9. I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of<br>
you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all<br>
strength.</p>

<p>2:10. We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea, at<br>
your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to<br>
the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and<br>
Og whom you slew.</p>

<p>2:11. And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart<br>
fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming<br>
in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth<br>
beneath.</p>

<p>2:12. Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewed<br>
mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father's house: and give<br>
me a true token.</p>

<p>2:13. That you will save my father and mother, my brethren and sisters,<br>
and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.</p>

<p>2:14. They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou<br>
betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we<br>
will shew thee mercy and truth.</p>

<p>2:15. Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house<br>
joined close to the wall.</p>

<p>2:16. And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps<br>
they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they<br>
come back, and so you shall go on yonr way.</p>

<p>2:17. And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which<br>
thou hast made us swear,</p>

<p>2:18. If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and<br>
thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather<br>
together thy father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred into<br>
thy house.</p>

<p>2:19. Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall<br>
be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that<br>
shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man<br>
touch them.</p>

<p>2:20. But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall<br>
be quit of this oath, which thou hast made us swear.</p>

<p>2:21. And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done: and sending<br>
them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.</p>

<p>2:22. But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three<br>
days, till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them<br>
through all the way, they found them not.</p>

<p>2:23. And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned,<br>
and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came<br>
to Josue, the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them,</p>

<p>2:24. And said: the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands,<br>
and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 3</p>

<p>The river Jordan is miraculously dried up for the passage of the<br>
children of Israel.</p>

<p>3:1. And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and they<br>
departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan: he, and all the children of<br>
Israel, and they abode there for three days.</p>

<p>3:2. After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,</p>

<p>3:3. And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the covenant<br>
of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it,<br>
rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:</p>

<p>3:4. And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand<br>
cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go:<br>
for you have not gone this way before: and take care you come not near<br>
the ark.</p>

<p>3:5. And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for tomorrow the<br>
Lord will do wonders among you.</p>

<p>3:6. And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the covenant, and go<br>
before the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took it up, and<br>
walked before them.</p>

<p>3:7. And the Lord said to Josue: This day will I begin to exalt thee<br>
before Israel: that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with<br>
thee also.</p>

<p>3:8. And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark of the<br>
covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the<br>
water of the Jordan, stand in it.</p>

<p>3:9. And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither, and hear the<br>
word of the Lord your God.</p>

<p>3:10. And again he said: By this you shall know, that the Lord, the<br>
living God, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before<br>
your sight, the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the<br>
Pherezite, the Gergesite also, and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.</p>

<p>3:11. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall<br>
go before you into the Jordan.</p>

<p>3:12. Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of every tribe.</p>

<p>3:13. And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of<br>
the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the<br>
Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those<br>
that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.</p>

<p>3:14. So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan:<br>
and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant, went on before<br>
them.</p>

<p>3:15. And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were<br>
dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had<br>
filled the banks of its channel,)</p>

<p>3:16. The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and<br>
swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city that is<br>
called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran<br>
down into the sea of the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea)<br>
until they wholly failed.</p>

<p>3:17. And the people marched over against Jericho: and the priests that<br>
carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry<br>
ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over,<br>
through the channel that was dried up.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 4</p>

<p>Twelve stones are taken out of the river to be set up for a monument of<br>
the miracle; and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river.</p>

<p>4:1. And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:</p>

<p>4:2. Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:</p>

<p>4:3. And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the<br>
feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set<br>
in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.</p>

<p>4:4. And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children<br>
of Israel, one out of every tribe,</p>

<p>4:5. And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the<br>
midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your<br>
shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,</p>

<p>4:6. That it may be a sign among you: and when your children shall ask<br>
you tomorrow, saying: What means these stones?</p>

<p>4:7. You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off before the<br>
ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same: therefore<br>
were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.</p>

<p>4:8. The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them,<br>
carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had<br>
commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the<br>
place wherein they camped, and there they set them.</p>

<p>4:9. And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of<br>
the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark of the<br>
covenant: and they are there until this present day.</p>

<p>4:10. Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the<br>
Jordan, till all things were accomplished, which the Lord had commanded<br>
Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the people<br>
made haste, and passed over.</p>

<p>4:11. And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed<br>
over, and the priests went before the people.</p>

<p>4:12. The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the tribe of<br>
Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had<br>
commanded them.</p>

<p>4:13. And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands, marched<br>
through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.</p>

<p>4:14. In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel,<br>
that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.<br>
4:15. And he said to him:</p>

<p>4:16. Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come<br>
up out of the Jordan.</p>

<p>4:17. And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.</p>

<p>4:18. And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord,<br>
were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned<br>
into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.</p>

<p>4:19. And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the<br>
first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the<br>
city of Jericho.</p>

<p>4:20. And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of<br>
the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,</p>

<p>4:21. And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask<br>
their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?</p>

<p>4:22. You shall teach them, and say: Israel passed over this Jordan<br>
through the dry channel,</p>

<p>4:23. The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight,<br>
until you passed over:</p>

<p>4:24. As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we<br>
passed through:</p>

<p>4:25. That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of<br>
the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 5</p>

<p>The people are circumcised: they keep the pasch. The manna ceaseth. An<br>
angel appeareth to Josue.</p>

<p>5:1. Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the<br>
Jordan, westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places<br>
near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of<br>
the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their<br>
heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the<br>
coming in of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>5:2. At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of stone, and<br>
circumcise the second time the children of Israel.</p>

<p>The second time... Not that such as had been circumcised before were to<br>
be circumcised again; but that they were now to renew, and take up again<br>
the practice of circumcision; which had been omitted during their forty<br>
years' sojourning in the wilderness; by reason of their being always<br>
uncertain when they should be obliged to march.</p>

<p>5:3. He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children<br>
of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.</p>

<p>5:4. Now this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the people<br>
that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in<br>
the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way:</p>

<p>5:6. Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were born in<br>
the desert,</p>

<p>5:6. During the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were<br>
uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice<br>
of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew<br>
them the land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p>5:7. The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and<br>
were circumcised by Josue: for they were uncircumcised even as they were<br>
born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.</p>

<p>5:8. Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same<br>
place of the camp, until they were healed.</p>

<p>5:9. And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away from you the<br>
reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until<br>
this present day.</p>

<p>5:10. And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the<br>
phase, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of<br>
Jericho:</p>

<p>5:11. And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the<br>
land, and frumenty of the same year.</p>

<p>5:12. And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land,<br>
neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate<br>
of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.</p>

<p>5:13. And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted<br>
up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding a drawn<br>
sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our<br>
adversaries?</p>

<p>5:14. And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and<br>
now I am come.</p>

<p>Prince of the host of the Lord, etc... St. Michael, who is called prince<br>
of the people of Israel, Dan. 10.21.</p>

<p>5:15. Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, said: What<br>
saith my lord to his servant?</p>

<p>Worshipping... Not with divine honour, but with a religious veneration<br>
of an inferior kind, suitable to the dignity of his person.</p>

<p>5:16. Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the place<br>
whereon thou standest is holy. And Josue did as was commanded him.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 6</p>

<p>After seven days' processions, the priests sounding the trumpets, the<br>
walls of Jericho fall down: and the city is taken and destroyed.</p>

<p>6:1. Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children<br>
of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.</p>

<p>6:2. And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands<br>
Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.</p>

<p>6:3. Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day: so shall ye<br>
do for six days.</p>

<p>6:4. And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets,<br>
which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the<br>
covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests<br>
shall sound the trumpets.</p>

<p>6:5. And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken<br>
tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together<br>
with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the<br>
ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which<br>
they shall stand.</p>

<p>6:6. Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them:<br>
Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven<br>
trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.</p>

<p>6:7. And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed,<br>
marching before the ark of the Lord.</p>

<p>6:8. And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the<br>
seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,</p>

<p>6:9. And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people<br>
followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.</p>

<p>6:10. But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout,<br>
nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until<br>
the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.</p>

<p>6:11. So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and<br>
returning into the camp, abode there.</p>

<p>6:12. And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,</p>

<p>6:13. And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee:<br>
and they went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding the<br>
trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common<br>
people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.</p>

<p>6:14. And they went round about the city the second day once, and<br>
returned into the camp. So they did six days.</p>

<p>6:15. But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as<br>
it was ordered, seven times.</p>

<p>6:16. And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the<br>
trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered<br>
the city to you:</p>

<p>6:17. And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it,<br>
to the Lord. Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with<br>
her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</p>

<p>6:18. But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are<br>
forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of<br>
Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</p>

<p>6:19. But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass<br>
and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.</p>

<p>6:20. So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when<br>
the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the<br>
walls forthwith fell down: and every man went up by the place that was<br>
over against him: and they took the city,</p>

<p>6:21. And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The<br>
oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the<br>
sword.</p>

<p>6:22. But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go<br>
into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all things that are<br>
hers, as you assured her by oath.</p>

<p>6:23. And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents,<br>
her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to<br>
stay without the camp.</p>

<p>6:24. But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except<br>
the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they<br>
consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord.</p>

<p>6:25. But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father's house, and all<br>
she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day:<br>
because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At<br>
that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:</p>

<p>6:26. Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build<br>
the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof,<br>
and in the last of his children set up its gates.</p>

<p>Cursed, etc... Jericho, in the mystical sense, signifies iniquity: the<br>
sounding of the trumpets by the priests, the preaching of the word of<br>
God; by which the walls of Jericho are thrown down, when sinners are<br>
converted; and a dreadful curse will light on them who build them up<br>
again.</p>

<p>6:27. And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout<br>
all the land.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 7</p>

<p>For the sins of Achan, the Israelites are defeated at Hai. The offender<br>
is found out; and stoned to death, and God's wrath is turned from them.</p>

<p>7:1. But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and took<br>
to their own use of that which was accursed. For Achan, the son of<br>
Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took<br>
something of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the children<br>
of Israel.</p>

<p>7:2. And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside<br>
Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go<br>
up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed<br>
Hai.</p>

<p>7:3. And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but<br>
let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why should all<br>
the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?</p>

<p>7:4. There went up therefore three thousand fighting men: who<br>
immediately turned their backs,</p>

<p>7:5. And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of<br>
them six and thirty men: and the enemies pursued them from the gate as<br>
far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and the<br>
heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.</p>

<p>7:6. But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before<br>
the ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of<br>
Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.</p>

<p>7:7. And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this<br>
people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the<br>
Amorrhite, and to destroy us? &nbsp;would God we had stayed beyond the<br>
Jordan, as we began.</p>

<p>7:8. My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to<br>
their enemies?</p>

<p>7:9. The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of<br>
it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name<br>
from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?</p>

<p>7:10. And the Lord said to Josue: Arise, why liest thou flat on the<br>
ground?</p>

<p>7:11. Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have<br>
taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among<br>
their goods.</p>

<p>7:12. Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee<br>
from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be no more<br>
with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.</p>

<p>7:13. Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye sanctified<br>
against tomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The curse is in<br>
the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies,<br>
till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.</p>

<p>7:14. And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes: and<br>
what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and<br>
the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men.</p>

<p>7:15. And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he<br>
shall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he hath<br>
transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in<br>
Israel.</p>

<p>7:16. Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to come<br>
by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.</p>

<p>7:17. Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family<br>
of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:</p>

<p>7:18. And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of<br>
Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.</p>

<p>7:19. And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord God of<br>
Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.</p>

<p>7:20. And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed I have sinned<br>
against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.</p>

<p>7:21. For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding good, and<br>
two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles: and I<br>
coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the<br>
midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.</p>

<p>7:22. Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent, found all<br>
hid in the same place, together with the silver.</p>

<p>7:23. And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue,<br>
and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.</p>

<p>7:24. Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare,<br>
and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and<br>
his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and all<br>
the goods: and brought them to the valley of Achor:</p>

<p>His sons, etc... Probably conscious to, or accomplices of, the crime of<br>
their father.</p>

<p>7:25. Where Josue said: Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord trouble<br>
thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things that were his,<br>
were consumed with fire.</p>

<p>7:26. And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which<br>
remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned<br>
away from them. &nbsp;And the name of that place was called the Valley of<br>
Achor, until this day.</p>

<p>Achor... That is, trouble.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 8</p>

<p>Hai is taken and burnt, and all the inhabitants slain. An altar is<br>
built, and sacrifices offered. The law is written on stones, and the<br>
blessings and cursings are read before all the people.</p>

<p>8:1. And the Lord said to Josue: Fear not, nor be thou dismayed: take<br>
with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go up to the<br>
town of Hai: Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and<br>
the people, and the city, and the land.</p>

<p>8:2. And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as<br>
thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but the spoils, and<br>
all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush<br>
for the city behind it.</p>

<p>8:3. And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to<br>
go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the<br>
night,</p>

<p>8:4. And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the city: and go<br>
not very far from it: and be ye all ready.</p>

<p>8:5. But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will<br>
approach on the contrary side against the city. &nbsp;And when they shall<br>
come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:</p>

<p>8:6. Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for they will<br>
think that we flee as before.</p>

<p>8:7. And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out of<br>
the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the Lord your God will<br>
deliver it into your hands.</p>

<p>8:8. And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do<br>
all things so as I have commanded.</p>

<p>8:9. And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush,<br>
and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city of Hai.<br>
But Josue staid that night in the midst of the people,</p>

<p>8:10. And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and<br>
went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the<br>
aid of the fighting men.</p>

<p>8:11. And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city,<br>
they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there<br>
was a valley in the midst.</p>

<p>8:12. And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush<br>
between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:</p>

<p>Five thousand... These were part of the thirty thousand mentioned above,<br>
ver. 3.</p>

<p>8:13. But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north<br>
side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the<br>
city. So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.</p>

<p>8:14. And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning,<br>
and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array,<br>
toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.</p>

<p>8:15. But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were<br>
afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.</p>

<p>8:16. But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued<br>
them. And when they were come from the city,</p>

<p>8:17. And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did<br>
not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,</p>

<p>8:18. The Lord said to Josue: Lift up the shield that is in thy hand,<br>
towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.</p>

<p>8:19. And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the ambush,<br>
that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city, took it, and<br>
set it on fire.</p>

<p>8:20. And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue, looking back,<br>
and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power to<br>
flee this way or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited<br>
flight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly<br>
against them that pursued.</p>

<p>8:21. So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and that<br>
the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.</p>

<p>8:22. And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out<br>
of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who were<br>
surrounded by them. So that the enemies being cut off on both sides, not<br>
one of so great a multitude was saved.</p>

<p>8:23. And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to<br>
Josue.</p>

<p>8:24. So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight to<br>
the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place, the children<br>
of Israel returned and laid waste the city.</p>

<p>8:25. And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women,<br>
was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.</p>

<p>8:26. But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on<br>
high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.</p>

<p>8:27. And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the<br>
prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.</p>

<p>8:28. And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:</p>

<p>8:29. And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and<br>
the going down of the sun. Then Josue commanded, and they took down his<br>
carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of the city,<br>
heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this<br>
present day.</p>

<p>8:30. Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount<br>
Hebal,</p>

<p>8:31. As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of<br>
Israel, and it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of<br>
unhewn stones, which iron had not touched: and he offered upon it<br>
holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.</p>

<p>8:32. And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses,<br>
which he had ordered before the children of Israel.</p>

<p>8:33. And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges,<br>
stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried the ark<br>
of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born<br>
among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as<br>
Moses the servant of the Lord, had commanded. And first he blessed the<br>
people of Israel.</p>

<p>8:34. After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing,<br>
and all things that were written in the book of the law.</p>

<p>8:35. He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded, but<br>
he repeated all before all the people of Israel, with the women and<br>
children, and strangers, that dwelt among them.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 9</p>

<p>Josue is deceived by the Gabaonites: who being detected are condemned to<br>
be perpetual servants.</p>

<p>9:1. Now when these things were heard of, all the kings beyond the<br>
Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains, and in the plains, in the places<br>
near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell<br>
by Libanus, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the<br>
Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,</p>

<p>9:2. Gathered themselves together, to fight against Josue and Israel<br>
with one mind, and one resolution.</p>

<p>9:3. But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Josue had done to<br>
Jericho and Hai:</p>

<p>9:4. Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions, laying old sacks<br>
upon their asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up again,</p>

<p>9:5. And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted with<br>
patches, and old garments upon them: the loaves also, which they carried<br>
for provisions by the way, were hard, and broken into &nbsp;pieces:</p>

<p>9:6. And they went to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and<br>
said to him, and to all Israel with him: We are come from a far country,<br>
desiring to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered<br>
them, and said:</p>

<p>9:7. Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if so, we can<br>
make no league with you.</p>

<p>9:8. But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue said to them:<br>
Who are you? and whence came you?</p>

<p>9:9. They answered: From a very far country thy servants are come in the<br>
name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of his power, all<br>
the things that he did in Egypt.</p>

<p>9:10. And to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the<br>
Jordan, Sehon, king of Hesebon, and Og, king of Basan, that was in<br>
Astaroth:</p>

<p>9:11. And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country, said to<br>
us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We<br>
are your servants, make ye a league with us.</p>

<p>9:12. Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses<br>
to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces by being<br>
exceeding old.</p>

<p>9:13. These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are<br>
rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our<br>
feet, by reason of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost<br>
consumed.</p>

<p>9:14. They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not the mouth<br>
of the Lord.</p>

<p>9:15. And Josue made peace with them, and entering into a league,<br>
promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the<br>
multitude swore to them.</p>

<p>9:16. Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they<br>
dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.</p>

<p>9:17. And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their<br>
cities on the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and Caphira,<br>
and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.</p>

<p>9:18. And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had<br>
sworn in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the common<br>
people murmured against the princes.</p>

<p>9:19. And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of the<br>
Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.</p>

<p>9:20. But this we will do to them: Let their lives be saved, lest the<br>
wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn:</p>

<p>9:21. But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing<br>
wood, and bringing in water. As they were speaking these things,</p>

<p>9;22. Josue called the Gabaonites, and said to them: Why would you<br>
impose upon us, saying: We dwell very far off from you, whereas you are<br>
in the midst of us?</p>

<p>9:23. Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always<br>
be hewers of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my God.</p>

<p>9:24. They answered: It was told us, thy servants, that the Lord thy God<br>
had promised his servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy<br>
all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and<br>
provided for our lives, compelled by the dread we had of you, and we<br>
took this counsel.</p>

<p>9:25. And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth good and<br>
right unto thee.</p>

<p>9:26. So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of<br>
the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.</p>

<p>9:27. And he gave orders in that day, that they should be in the service<br>
of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood, and<br>
carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the Lord<br>
hath chosen.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 10</p>

<p>Five kings war against Gabaon. Josue defeateth them: many are slain with<br>
hailstones. At the prayer of Josue the sun and moon stand still the<br>
space of one day. The five kings are hanged. Divers cities are taken.</p>

<p>10:1. When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to<br>
wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done<br>
to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that<br>
the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,</p>

<p>10:2. He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of<br>
the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting<br>
men were most valiant.</p>

<p>10:3. Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of<br>
Hebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis,<br>
and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:</p>

<p>10:4. Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it<br>
hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.</p>

<p>10:5. So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together, went<br>
up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the<br>
king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped<br>
about Gabaon, laying siege to it.</p>

<p>10:6. But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged,<br>
sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him:<br>
Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly, and<br>
save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who<br>
dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.</p>

<p>10:7. And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors<br>
with him, most valiant men.</p>

<p>10:8. But the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have delivered<br>
them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against thee.</p>

<p>10:9. So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them<br>
suddenly.</p>

<p>10:10. And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel: and he slew<br>
them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of<br>
the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and<br>
Maceda.</p>

<p>10:11. And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were<br>
in the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones<br>
from heaven, as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with the<br>
hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,</p>

<p>10:12. Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the<br>
Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before<br>
them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the<br>
valley of Ajalon.</p>

<p>10:13. And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged<br>
themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the<br>
just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to<br>
go down the space of one day.</p>

<p>The book of the just... In Hebrew Jasher: an ancient book long since<br>
lost.</p>

<p>10:14. There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying<br>
the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.</p>

<p>10:15. And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.</p>

<p>10:16. For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of<br>
the city of Maceda.</p>

<p>10:17. And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a<br>
cave of the city of Maceda.</p>

<p>10:18. And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great<br>
stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut<br>
up:</p>

<p>10:19. And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the<br>
hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord<br>
God hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their<br>
cities.</p>

<p>10:20. So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost<br>
utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered<br>
into fenced cities.</p>

<p>10:21. And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda, where the camp<br>
then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one: and no man<br>
durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.</p>

<p>10:22. And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and<br>
bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.</p>

<p>10:23. And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they brought<br>
out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the<br>
king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of<br>
Eglon.</p>

<p>10:24. And when they were brought out to him, he called all the men of<br>
Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him: Go, and<br>
set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone, and<br>
put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,</p>

<p>10:25. He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take<br>
courage, and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your enemies,<br>
against whom you fight.</p>

<p>10:26. And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five<br>
gibbets; and they hung until the evening.</p>

<p>10:27. And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them<br>
down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them<br>
into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the<br>
mouth thereof, which remain until this day.</p>

<p>10:28. The same day Josue took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge of<br>
the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left<br>
not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had<br>
done to the king of Jericho.</p>

<p>10:29. And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought<br>
against it:</p>

<p>10:30. And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of<br>
Israel: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all<br>
the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did<br>
to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.</p>

<p>10:31. From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and investing<br>
it with his army, besieged it.</p>

<p>10:32. And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he<br>
took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that<br>
was in it, as he had done to Lebna.</p>

<p>10:33. At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and<br>
Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.</p>

<p>10:34. And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,</p>

<p>10:35. And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the souls that<br>
were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.</p>

<p>10:36. He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought<br>
against it:</p>

<p>10:37. Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king<br>
also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that<br>
dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon,<br>
so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.</p>

<p>The king... Viz., the new king, who succeeded him that was slain, ver.<br>
26.</p>

<p>10:38. Returning from thence to Dabir,</p>

<p>10:39. He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof, and all the<br>
towns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not<br>
in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their<br>
kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.</p>

<p>10:40. So Josue conquered all the country of the hills, and of the<br>
south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not<br>
any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God of<br>
Israel, had commanded him.</p>

<p>Any remains therein, but slew, etc... God ordered these people to be<br>
utterly destroyed, in punishment of their manifold abomination; and that<br>
they might not draw the Israelites into the like sins.</p>

<p>10:41. From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen even to<br>
Gabaon,</p>

<p>10:42. And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one<br>
onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.</p>

<p>10:43. And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in<br>
Galgal.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 11</p>

<p>The kings of the north are overthrown: the whole country is taken.</p>

<p>11:1. And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he sent to<br>
Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king of<br>
Achsaph:</p>

<p>11:2. And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in<br>
the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels<br>
and the countries of Dor by the sea side:</p>

<p>11:3. To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west, and the<br>
Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the<br>
mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the<br>
land of Maspha.</p>

<p>11:4. And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding<br>
numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and<br>
chariots a very great multitude,</p>

<p>11:5. And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to<br>
fight against Israel.</p>

<p>11:6. And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for to morrow at this<br>
same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel:<br>
thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots<br>
with fire.</p>

<p>Hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire, etc... God so<br>
ordained, that his people might not trust in chariots and horses, but in<br>
him.</p>

<p>11:7. And Josue came, and all the army with him, against them to the<br>
waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.</p>

<p>11:8. And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. And they<br>
defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon and the waters<br>
of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof. He<br>
slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:</p>

<p>11:9. And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their<br>
horses and burned their chariots.</p>

<p>11:10. And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king<br>
thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these<br>
kingdoms.</p>

<p>11:11. And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left not in it<br>
any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with<br>
fire.</p>

<p>11:12. And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities<br>
round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had commanded<br>
him.</p>

<p>11:13. Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest<br>
Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.</p>

<p>11:14. And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil<br>
of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.</p>

<p>11:15. As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command<br>
Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the<br>
commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>

<p>11:16. So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and<br>
the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain<br>
of Israel, and the plains thereof:</p>

<p>11:17. And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad,<br>
by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings he took,<br>
smote and slew.</p>

<p>11:18. Josue made war a long time against these kings.</p>

<p>A long time... Seven years, as appears from chap. 14.10.</p>

<p>11:19. There was not a city that delivered itself to the children of<br>
Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by<br>
fight.</p>

<p>11:20. For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be<br>
hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not<br>
deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded<br>
Moses.</p>

<p>Hardened... This hardening of their hearts, was their having no thought<br>
of yielding or submitting: which was a sentence or judgment of God upon<br>
them in punishment of their enormous crimes.</p>

<p>11:21. At that time Josue came and cut off the Enancims from the<br>
mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain<br>
of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.</p>

<p>11:22. He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the<br>
children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and Azotus, in<br>
which alone they were left.</p>

<p>11:23. So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to Moses, and<br>
delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according to their<br>
divisions and tribes. And the land rested from wars.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 12</p>

<p>A list of the kings slain by Moses and Josue,</p>

<p>12:1. These are the kings, whom the children of Israel slew and<br>
possessed their land beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun,<br>
from the torrent Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the east country that<br>
looketh towards the wilderness.</p>

<p>12:2. Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and had<br>
dominion from Aroer, which is seated upon the bank of the torrent Arnon,<br>
and of the middle part in the valley, and of half Galaad, as far as the<br>
torrent Jaboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>12:3. And from the wilderness, to the sea of Ceneroth towards the east,<br>
and to the sea of the wilderness, which is the most salt sea, on the<br>
east side by the way that leadeth to Bethsimoth: and on the south side<br>
that lieth under Asedoth, Phasga.</p>

<p>12:4. The border of Og the king of Basan, of the remnant of the Raphaims<br>
who dwelt in Astaroth, and in Edrai, and had dominion in mount Hermon,<br>
and in Salecha, and in all Basan, unto the borders</p>

<p>12:5. Of Gessuri and Machati, and of half Galaad: the borders of Sehon<br>
the king of Hesebon.</p>

<p>12:6. Moses the servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel slew<br>
them, and Moses delivered their land in possession to the Rubenites, and<br>
Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses.</p>

<p>12:7. These are the kings of the land, whom Josue and the children of<br>
Israel slew beyond the Jordan on the west side from Baalgad in the field<br>
of Libanus, unto the mount, part of which goeth up into Seir: and Josue<br>
delivered it in possession to the tribes of Israel, to every one their<br>
divisions,</p>

<p>12:8. As well in the mountains as in the plains and the champaign<br>
countries. In Asedoth, and in the wilderness, and in the south was the<br>
Hethite and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite and the Pherezite, the Hevite<br>
and the Jebusite.</p>

<p>12:9. The king of Jericho one: the king of Hai, which is on the side of<br>
Bethel, one:</p>

<p>12:10. The king of Jerusalem one, the king of Hebron one,</p>

<p>12:11. The king of Jerimoth one, thee king of Lachis one,</p>

<p>12:12. The king of Eglon one, the king of Gazer one,</p>

<p>12:13. The king of Dabir one, the king of Gader one,</p>

<p>12:14. The king of Herma one, the king of Hered one,</p>

<p>12:15. The king of Lebna one, the king of Odullam one,</p>

<p>12:16. The king of Maceda one, the king of Bethel one,</p>

<p>12:17. The king of Taphua one, the king of Opher one,</p>

<p>12:18. The king of Aphec one, the king of Saron one,</p>

<p>12:19. The king of Madon one, the king of Asor one,</p>

<p>12:20. The king of Semeron one, the king of Achsaph one,</p>

<p>12:21. The king of Thenac one, the king of Mageddo one,</p>

<p>12:22. Thee king of Cades one, the king of Jachanan of Carmel one,</p>

<p>12:23. The king of Dor, and of the province of Dor one, the king of the<br>
nations of Galgal one,</p>

<p>12:24. The king of Thersa one: all the kings thirty and one.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 13</p>

<p>God commandeth Josue to divide the land: the possessions of Ruben, Gad,<br>
and half the tribe of Manasses, beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p>13:1. Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to<br>
him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large<br>
country left, which is not yet divided by lot:</p>

<p>Josue was old, and far advanced in years... He was then about one<br>
hundred and one years old.-And their is a very large country left, which<br>
is not yet divided by lot... Not yet possessed by the children of<br>
Israel.</p>

<p>13:2. To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.</p>

<p>13:3. From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the border of<br>
Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords<br>
of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the<br>
Gethites, and the Accronites.</p>

<p>13:4. And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan,<br>
and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the<br>
Amorrhite,</p>

<p>13:5. And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east<br>
from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.</p>

<p>13:6. Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of<br>
Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from<br>
before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as<br>
a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.</p>

<p>13:7. And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to<br>
the half tribe of Manasses,</p>

<p>13:8. With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the<br>
servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the<br>
east side.</p>

<p>With whom... That is, with the other half of that same tribe.</p>

<p>13:9. From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in<br>
the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:</p>

<p>13:10. And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned<br>
in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>13:11. And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount<br>
Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,</p>

<p>13:12. All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and<br>
Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses overthrew and<br>
destroyed them.</p>

<p>13:13. And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and Machati<br>
and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day.</p>

<p>13:14. But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: but the<br>
sacrifices and victims of thee Lord God of Israel, are his inheritance,<br>
as he spoke to him.</p>

<p>13:15. And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to<br>
their kindreds.</p>

<p>13:16. And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the<br>
torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent: all<br>
the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,</p>

<p>13:17. And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains.<br>
Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon,</p>

<p>13:18. And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath,</p>

<p>13:19. And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the mountain of the<br>
valley.</p>

<p>13:20. Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and Bethiesimoth,</p>

<p>13:21. And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon<br>
king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with<br>
the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes<br>
of Sehon inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>The princes of Madian... It appears from hence that these were subjects<br>
of king Sehon: they are said to have been slain with him, that is, about<br>
the same time, but not in the same battle.</p>

<p>13:22. Balaam also the son of Beor the soothsayer, the children of<br>
Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.</p>

<p>13:23. And the river Jordan was the border of the children of Ruben.<br>
This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities<br>
and villages.</p>

<p>13:24. And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their<br>
kindreds a possession, of which this is the division.</p>

<p>13:25. The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the<br>
land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is over against<br>
Rabba:</p>

<p>13:26. And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and from Manaim<br>
unto the borders of Dabir.</p>

<p>13:27. And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and Saphon<br>
the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the limit of<br>
this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of the sea of<br>
Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side,</p>

<p>13:28. This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families,<br>
their cities, and villages.</p>

<p>13:29. He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children<br>
possession according to their kindreds,</p>

<p>13:30. The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and all the<br>
kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in<br>
Basan, threescore towns.</p>

<p>13:31. And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom<br>
of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one<br>
half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.</p>

<p>13:32. This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the<br>
Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side,</p>

<p>13:33. But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because the Lord<br>
the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 14</p>

<p>Caleb's petition; Hebron is given to him and to his seed.</p>

<p>14:1. This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land of<br>
Chanaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the<br>
princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to them.</p>

<p>14:2. Dividing all by lot, as the Lord had commanded the hand of Moses,<br>
to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.</p>

<p>14:3. For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the<br>
Jordan: besides the Levites, who received no land among their brethren:</p>

<p>14:4. But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into<br>
two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive<br>
other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed<br>
their beasts and flocks.</p>

<p>Hebron belonged, etc... All the country thereabouts, depending on<br>
Hebron, was given to Caleb; but the city itself with the suburbs, was<br>
one of those that were given to the priests to dwell in.</p>

<p>14:5. As the Lord had commanded Moses so did the children of Israel, and<br>
they divided the land.</p>

<p>14:6. Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and Caleb the<br>
son of Jephone the Cenezite spoke to him: Thou knowest what the Lord<br>
spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesbarne.</p>

<p>14:7. I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me<br>
from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word again as to me<br>
seemed true,</p>

<p>14:8. But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart<br>
of the people: and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God.</p>

<p>14:9. And Moses swore in that day, saying: The land which thy foot hath<br>
trodden upon shall be thy possession, and thy children for ever, because<br>
thou hast followed the Lord my God.</p>

<p>14:10. The Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until<br>
this present day, It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this<br>
word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness: this day I<br>
am eighty-five years old,</p>

<p>14:11. As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land:<br>
the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to<br>
fight as to march.</p>

<p>14:12. Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy<br>
hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong: if<br>
so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as<br>
he promised me.</p>

<p>14:13. And Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron in possession.</p>

<p>14:14. And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone<br>
the Cenezite, until this present day: because he followed the Lord the<br>
God of Israel.</p>

<p>14:15. The name of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: Adam the<br>
greatest among the Enacims was laid there and the land rested from wars.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 15</p>

<p>The borders of the lot of Juda. Caleb's portion and conquest. The cities<br>
of Juda.</p>

<p>15:1. Now the lot of the children of Juda by their kindreds was this:<br>
From the frontier of Edom, to the desert of Sin southward, and to the<br>
uttermost part of the south coast.</p>

<p>15:2. Its beginning was from the top of the most salt sea, and from the<br>
bay thereof, that looketh to the south.</p>

<p>15:3. And it goeth out towards the ascent of the Scorpion, and passeth<br>
on to Sina: and ascendeth into Cadesbarne, and reacheth into Esron,<br>
going up to Addar, and compassing Carcaa.</p>

<p>15:4. And from thence passing along into Asemona, and reaching the<br>
torrent of Egypt: and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea, this<br>
shall be the limit of the south coast.</p>

<p>15:5. But on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt sea even<br>
to the end of the Jordan: and towards the north from the bay of the sea<br>
unto the same river Jordan.</p>

<p>15:6. And the border goeth up into Beth-Hagla, and passeth by the north<br>
into Beth-Araba: going up to the stone of Boen the son of Ruben.</p>

<p>15:7. And reaching as far as the borders of Debara from the valley of<br>
Achor, and so northward looking towards Galgal, which is opposite to the<br>
ascent of Adommin, on the south side of the torrent, and the border<br>
passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun: and the<br>
goings out thereof shall be at the fountain Rogel.</p>

<p>15:8. And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the side of<br>
the Jebusite towards the south, the same is Jerusalem: and thence<br>
ascending to the top of the mountain, which is over against Geennom to<br>
the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim, northward.</p>

<p>15:9. And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of<br>
the water of Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron: and it<br>
bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, the city<br>
of the woods.</p>

<p>15:10. And it compasseth from Baala westward unto mount Seir: and<br>
passeth by the side of mount Jarim to the north into Cheslon: and goeth<br>
down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.</p>

<p>15:11. And reacheth northward to a part of Accaron at the side: and<br>
bendeth to Sechrona, and passeth mount Baala: and cometh into Jebneel,<br>
and is bounded westward with the great sea.</p>

<p>15:12. These are the borders round about of the children of Juda in<br>
their kindreds.</p>

<p>15:13. But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of<br>
the children of Juda, as the Lord had commanded him: Cariath-Arbe the<br>
father of Enac, which is Hebron.</p>

<p>15:14. And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac, Sesai and<br>
Ahiman, and Tholmai of the race of Enac.</p>

<p>15:15. And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of Dabir,<br>
which before was called Cariath-Sepher, that is to say, the city of<br>
letters.</p>

<p>15:16. And Caleb said: He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and take it,<br>
I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.</p>

<p>15:17. And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, took<br>
it: and he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.</p>

<p>15:18. And as they were going together, she was moved by her husband to<br>
ask a field of her father, and she sighed as she sat on her ass. And<br>
Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?</p>

<p>15:19. But she answered: Give me a blessing: thou hast given me a<br>
southern and dry land, give me also a land that Is watered. &nbsp;And Caleb<br>
gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.</p>

<p>15:20. This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Juda by<br>
their kindreds.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 16</p>

<p>The lot of the sons of Joseph. The borders of the tribe of Ephraim.</p>

<p>16:1. And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan over<br>
against Jericho and the waters thereof, on the east: the wilderness<br>
which goeth up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel:</p>

<p>16:2. And goeth out from Bethel to Luza: and passeth the border of<br>
Archi, to Ataroth,</p>

<p>16:3. And goeth down westward, by the border of Jephleti, unto the<br>
borders of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gazer: and the countries of it<br>
are ended by the great sea:</p>

<p>16:4. And Manasses and Ephraim the children of Joseph possessed it.</p>

<p>16:5. And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their<br>
kindreds: and their possession towards the east was Ataroth-addar unto<br>
Beth-horon the upper.</p>

<p>16:6. And the confines go out unto the sea: but Machmethath looketh to<br>
the north, and it goeth round the borders eastward into Thanath-selo:<br>
and passeth along on the east side to Janoe.</p>

<p>Looketh to the north, etc... The meaning is, that the border went<br>
towards the north, by Machmethath; and then turned eastward to Thanath-<br>
selo.</p>

<p>16:7. And it goeth down from Janoe into Ataroth and Naaratha: and it<br>
cometh to Jericho, and goeth out to the Jordan.</p>

<p>16:8. From Taphua it passeth on towards the sea into the valley of<br>
reeds, and the goings out thereof are at the most salt sea. &nbsp;This is the<br>
possession of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.</p>

<p>16:9. And there were cities with their villages separated for the<br>
children of Ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children of<br>
Manasses.</p>

<p>16:10. And the children of Ephraim slew not the Chanaanite, who dwelt in<br>
Gazer: and the Chanaanite dwelt in the midst of Ephraim until this day,<br>
paying tribute.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 17</p>

<p>The lot of the half tribe of Manasses.</p>

<p>17:1. And this lot fell to the tribe of Manasses for he is the firstborn<br>
of Joseph to Machir the firstborn of Manasses the father of Galaad, who<br>
was a warlike man, and had for possession Galaad and Basan.</p>

<p>17:2. And to the rest of the children of Manasses according to their<br>
families: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helec, and<br>
to the children of Esriel, and to the children of Sechem, and to the<br>
children of Hepher, and to the children of Semida: these are the male<br>
children of Manasses the son of Joseph, by their kindreds.</p>

<p>17:3. But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad the son of Machir<br>
the son of Manasses had no sons, but only daughters: whose names are<br>
these, Maala and Noa and Hegla and Melcha and Thersa.</p>

<p>17:4. And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest and of Josue<br>
the son of Nun, and of the princes, saying: The Lord commanded by the<br>
hand of Moses, that a possession should be given us in the midst of our<br>
brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a<br>
possession amongst the brethren of their father.</p>

<p>17:5. And there fell ten portions to Manasses, beside the land of Galaad<br>
and Basan beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p>17:6. For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance in the midst<br>
of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the<br>
children of Manasses.</p>

<p>17:7. And the border of Manasses was from Aser, Machmethath which<br>
looketh towards Sichem: and it goeth out on the right hand by the<br>
inhabitants of the fountain of Taphua.</p>

<p>17:8. For the lot of Manasses took in the land of Taphua, which is on<br>
the borders of Manasses, and belongs to the children of Ephraim.</p>

<p>17:9. And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds, to the south<br>
of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst of the<br>
cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses is on the north side of the<br>
torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the sea:</p>

<p>17:10. So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on the<br>
north that of Manasses, and the sea is the border of both, and they are<br>
joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north, and in the tribe of<br>
Issachar on the east.</p>

<p>17:11. And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and in Aser, was<br>
Bethsan and its villages, and Jeblaam with its villages, and the<br>
inhabitants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhabitants also of<br>
Endor with the villages thereof: and in like manner the inhabitants of<br>
Thenac with the villages thereof: and the inhabitants of Mageddo with<br>
their villages, and the third part of the city of Nopheth.</p>

<p>17:12. Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow these cities,<br>
but the Chanaanite began to dwell in his land.</p>

<p>17:13. But after that the children of Israel were grown strong, they<br>
subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and they did<br>
not kill them.</p>

<p>17:14. And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and said: Why hast<br>
thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas I am of so<br>
great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed me?</p>

<p>17:15. And Josue said to them: If thou be a great people, go up into the<br>
woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and<br>
the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for<br>
thee.</p>

<p>17:16. And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot go up to the<br>
mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein are<br>
situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley,<br>
have chariots of iron.</p>

<p>17:17. And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasses:<br>
Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one<br>
lot only:</p>

<p>17:18. But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut down the wood,<br>
and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed farther, when thou<br>
hast destroyed the Chanaanites, who as thou sayest have iron chariots,<br>
and are very strong.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 18</p>

<p>Surveyors are sent to divide the rest of the land into seven tribes.<br>
The lot of Benjamin.</p>

<p>18:1. And all the children of Israel assembled together in Silo, and<br>
there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony, and the land was<br>
subdued before them.</p>

<p>18:2. But there remained seven tribes of the children of Israel, which<br>
as yet had not received their possessions.</p>

<p>18:3. And Josue said to them: How long are you indolent and slack, and<br>
go not in to possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers<br>
hath given you?</p>

<p>18:4. Choose of every tribe three men, that I may send them, and they<br>
may go and compass the land, and mark it out according to the number of<br>
each multitude: and bring back to me what they have marked out.</p>

<p>18:5. Divide to yourselves the land into seven parts: let Juda be in his<br>
bounds on the south side, and the house of Joseph on the north.</p>

<p>18:6. The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts;<br>
and you shall come hither to me, that I may cast lots for you before the<br>
Lord your God.</p>

<p>The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts... That<br>
is to say, the rest of the land, which is not already assigned to Juda<br>
or Joseph.</p>

<p>18:7. For the Levites have no part among you, but the priesthood of the<br>
Lord is their inheritance. And Gad and Ruben, and the half tribe of<br>
Manasses have already received their possessions beyond the Jordan<br>
eastward: which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.</p>

<p>18:8. And when the men were risen up, to go to mark out the land, Josue<br>
commanded them saying: Go round the land and mark it out, and return to<br>
me: that I may cast lots for you before the Lord in Silo.</p>

<p>18:9. So they went and surveying it divided it into seven parts, writing<br>
them down in a book. And they returned to Josue, to the camp in Silo.</p>

<p>18:10. And he cast lots before the Lord in Silo, and divided the land to<br>
the children of Israel into seven parts.</p>

<p>18:11. And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin by their<br>
families, to possess the land between the children of Juda, and the<br>
children of Joseph.</p>

<p>18:12. And their border northward was from the Jordan: going along by<br>
the side of Jericho on the north side, and thence going up westward to<br>
the mountains, and reaching to the wilderness of Bethaven,</p>

<p>18:13. And passing along southward by Luza, the same is Bethel, and it<br>
goeth down into Ataroth-addar to the mountain, that is on the south of<br>
the nether Beth-horon.</p>

<p>18:14. And it bendeth thence going round towards the sea, south of the<br>
mountain that looketh towards Beth-horon to the southwest: and the<br>
outgoings thereof are into Cariathbaal, which is called also<br>
Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Juda This is their coast towards<br>
the sea, westward.</p>

<p>18:15. But on the south side the border goeth out from part of<br>
Cariathiarim towards the sea, and cometh to the fountain of the waters<br>
of Nephtoa.</p>

<p>18:16. And it goeth down to that part of the mountain that looketh on<br>
the valley of the children of Ennom: and is over against the north<br>
quarter in the furthermost part of the valley of Raphaim, and it goeth<br>
down into Geennom (that is the valley of Ennom) by the side of the<br>
Jebusite to the south: and cometh to the fountain of Rogel,</p>

<p>18:17. Passing thence to the north, and going out to Ensemes, that is to<br>
say, the fountain of the sun:</p>

<p>18:18. And It passeth along to the hills that are over against the<br>
ascent of Adommim: and it goeth down to Abenboen, that is, the stone of<br>
Boen the son of Ruben: and it passeth on the north side to the champaign<br>
countries; and goeth down Into the plain,</p>

<p>18:19. And it passeth by Bethhagla northward: and the outgoings thereof<br>
are towards the north of the most salt sea at the south end of the<br>
Jordan.</p>

<p>18:20. Which is the border of it on the east side. This is the<br>
possession of the children of Benjamin by their borders round about, and<br>
their families.</p>

<p>18:21. And their cities were, Jericho and Bethhagla and Vale-Casis,</p>

<p>18:22. Betharaba and Samaraim and Bethel,</p>

<p>18:23. And Avim and Aphara and Ophera,</p>

<p>18:28. And Sela, Eleph and Jebus, which is Jerusalem, Gabaath and<br>
Cariath: fourteen cities, and their villages. This is the possession of<br>
the children of Benjamin by their families.</p>

Simeon according to their kindreds,</p>

<p>19:9. In the possession and lot of the children of Juda: because it was<br>
too great, and therefore the children of Simeon had their possession in<br>
the midst of their inheritance.</p>

kindreds: and the border of their possession was unto Sarid.</p>

the son of Nun in the midst of them,</p>

<p>19:50. According to the commandment of the Lord, the city which he asked<br>
for, Thamnath Saraa, in mount Ephraim: and he built up the city, and<br>

door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and they divided the land.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 20</p>

<p>The cities of refuge are appointed for casual manslaughter.</p>

<p>20:1. And the Lord spoke to Josue, saying: Speak to children of Israel<br>
and say to them:</p>

<p>20:2. Appoint cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of<br>
Moses:</p>

<p>20:3. That whosoever shall kill a person unawares may flee to them, and<br>
may escape the wrath of the kinsman, who is the avenger of blood.</p>

<p>20:4. And when he shall flee to one of these cities: he shall stand<br>
before the gate of the city, and shall speak to the ancients of that<br>
city, such things as prove him innocent: and so shall they receive him,<br>
and give him a place to dwell in.</p>

<p>20:5. And when the avenger of blood shall pursue him, they shall not<br>
deliver him into his hands, because he slew his neighbour unawares, and<br>
is not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before,</p>

<p>20:6. And he shall dwell in that city, till he stand before judgment to<br>
give an account of his fact, and till the death of the high priest, who<br>
shall be at that time: then shall the manslayer return, and go into his<br>
own city and house from whence he fled.</p>

<p>20:7. And they appointed Cedes in Galilee of mount Nephtali, and Sichem<br>
in mount Ephraim, and Cariath-Arbe, the same is Hebron in the mountain<br>
of Juda.</p>

<p>20:8. And beyond the Jordan to the east of Jericho, they appointed<br>
Bosor, which is upon the plain of the wilderness of the tribe of Ruben,<br>
and Ramoth in Galaad of the tribe of Gad, and Gaulon in Basan of the<br>
tribe of Manasses.</p>

<p>20:9. These cities were appointed for all the children of Israel, and<br>
for the strangers, that dwelt among them, that whosoever had killed a<br>
person unawares might flee to them, and not die by the hand of the<br>
kinsman, coveting to revenge the blood that was shed, until he should<br>
stand before the people to lay open his cause.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 21</p>

<p>Cities with their suburbs are assigned for the priests and Levites.</p>

<p>21:1. Then the princes of the families of Levi came to Eleazar the<br>
priest, and to Josue the son of Nun, and to the princes of the kindreds<br>
of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>21:2. And they spoke to them in Silo in the land of Chanaan, and said:<br>
The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, that cities should be given us<br>
to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed our cattle.</p>

<p>21:3. And the children of Israel gave out of their possessions according<br>
to the commandment of the Lord, cities and their suburbs.</p>

<p>21:4. And the lot came out for the family of Caath of the children of<br>
Aaron the priest out of the tribes of Juda, and of Simeon, and of<br>
Benjamin, thirteen cities.</p>

<p>21:5. And to the rest of the children of Caath, that is, to thee<br>
Levites, who remained, out of the tribes of Ephraim, and of Dan, and the<br>
half tribe of Manasses, ten cities.</p>

<p>21:6. And the lot came out to children of Gerson, that they should take<br>
of the tribes of Issachar and of Aser and of Nephtali, and of the half<br>
tribe of Manasses in Basan, thirteen cities.</p>

<p>21:7. And to the sons of Merari by their kindreds, of the tribes of<br>
Ruben and of Gad and of Zabulon, twelve cities.</p>

<p>21:8. And the children of Israel gave to the Levites the cities and<br>
their suburbs, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, giving to<br>
every one by lot.</p>

<p>21:9. Of the tribes of the children of Juda and of Simeon Josue gave<br>
cities: whose names are these,</p>

<p>21:10. To the sons of Aaron, of the families of Caath of the race of<br>
Levi (for the first lot came out for them)</p>

<p>21:11. The city of Arbe the father of Enac, which is called Hebron, in<br>
the mountain of Juda, and the suburbs thereof round about.</p>

<p>21:12. But the fields and the villages thereof he had given to Caleb the<br>
son of Jephone for his possession.</p>

<p>21:13. He gave therefore to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron a<br>
city of refuge, and the suburbs thereof, and Lebna with the suburbs<br>
thereof,</p>

<p>21:14. And Jether and Estemo,</p>

<p>21:15. And Holon, and Dabir,</p>

<p>21:16. And Ain, and Jeta, and Bethsames, with their suburbs: nine cities<br>
out of the two tribes, as hath been said.</p>

<p>21:17. And out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, Gabaon, and<br>
Gabae,</p>

<p>21:18. And Anathoth and Almon, with, their suburbs: four cities.</p>

<p>21:19. All the cities together of the children of Aaron the priest, were<br>
thirteen, with their suburbs,</p>

<p>21:20. And to the rest of the families of the children of Caath of the<br>
race of Levi was given this possession.</p>

<p>21:21. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Sichem one of the cities of refuge, with<br>
the suburbs thereof in mount Ephraim, and Gazer,</p>

<p>21:22. And Cibsaim, and Beth-horon, with their suburbs, four cities.</p>

<p>21:23. And of he tribe of Dan, Eltheco and Gabathon,</p>

<p>21:24. And Aialon and Gethremmon, with their suburbs, four cities.</p>

<p>21:25. And of the half tribe of Manasses, Thanac and Gethremmon, with<br>
their suburbs, two cities.</p>

<p>21:26. All the cities were ten, with their suburbs, which were given to<br>
the children of Caath, of the inferior degree.</p>

<p>21:27. To the children of Gerson also of the race of Levi out of the<br>
half tribe of Manasses, Gaulon in Basan, one of the cities of refuge,<br>
and Bosra, with their suburbs, two cities.</p>

<p>21:28. And of the tribe of Issachar, Cesion, and Dabereth,</p>

<p>21:29. And Jaramoth, and Engannim, with their suburbs, four cities.</p>

<p>21:30. And of the tribe of Aser, Masal and Abdon,</p>

<p>21:31. And Helcath, and Rohob, with their suburbs, four cities.</p>

<p>21:32. Of the tribe also of Nephtali, Cedes in Galilee, one of the<br>
cities of refuge: and Hammoth Dor, and Carthan, with their suburbs,<br>
three cities.</p>

<p>21:33. All the cities of the families of Gerson, were thirteen, with<br>
their suburbs.</p>

<p>21:34. And to the children of Merari, Levites of the inferior degree, by<br>
their families were given of the tribe of Zabulon, Jecnam and Cartha,</p>

<p>21:35. And Damna and Naalol, four cities with their suburbs.</p>

<p>21:36. Of the tribe of Ruben beyond the Jordan over against Jericho,<br>
Bosor in the wilderness, one of the cities of refuge, Misor and Jaser<br>
and Jethson and Mephaath, four cities with their suburbs.</p>

<p>Four cities... There are no more, though there be five names: for Misor<br>
is the same city as Bosor, which is to be observed in some other places,<br>
where the number of names exceeds the number of cities.</p>

<p>21:37. Of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Galaad, one of the cities of<br>
refuge, and Manaim and Hesebon and Jaser, four cities with their<br>
suburbs,</p>

<p>21:38. All the cities of the children of Merari by their families and<br>
kindreds, were twelve.</p>

<p>21:39. So all the cities of the Levites within the possession of the<br>
children of Israel were forty-eight,</p>

<p>21:40. &nbsp;With their suburbs, each distributed by the families.</p>

<p>21:41. And the Lord God gave to Israel all the land that he had sworn to<br>
give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.</p>

<p>21:42. And he gave them peace from all nations round about: and none of<br>
their enemies durst stand against them, but were brought under their<br>
dominion.</p>

<p>21:43. Not so much as one word, which he had promised to perform unto<br>
them, was made void, but all came to pass.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 22</p>

<p>The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses return to<br>
their possessions. They build an altar by the side of the Jordan, which<br>
alarms the other tribes. An embassage is sent to them, to which they<br>
give a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>22:1. At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and<br>
the half tribe of Manasses,</p>

<p>22:2. And said to them: You have done all that Moses the servant of the<br>
Lord commanded you: you have also obeyed me in all things,</p>

<p>22:3. Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this<br>
present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.</p>

<p>22:4. Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and<br>
peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land<br>
of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond<br>
the Jordan:</p>

<p>22:5. Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the<br>
commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded<br>
you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep<br>
all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your<br>
heart, and with all your soul.</p>

<p>22:6. And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to<br>
their dwellings.</p>

<p>22:7. Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in<br>
Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among<br>
the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And when he<br>
sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,</p>

<p>22:8. He said to them: With much substance and riches, you return to<br>
your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of<br>
raiment: divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.</p>

<p>22:9. So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half<br>
tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in<br>
Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their<br>
possession, which they had obtained according to the commandment of the<br>
Lord by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>22:10. And when they were come to banks of the Jordan, in the land of<br>
Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.</p>

<p>22:11. And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain<br>
messengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of<br>
Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of<br>
Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of<br>
Israel:</p>

<p>22:12. They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.</p>

<p>22:13. And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad,<br>
Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,</p>

<p>22:14. And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.</p>

<p>22:15. Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe<br>
of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:</p>

<p>22:16. Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this<br>
transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel,<br>
building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?</p>

<p>22:17. Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and<br>
the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the<br>
people perished.</p>

<p>22:18. And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath<br>
will rage against all Israel.</p>

<p>22:19. But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass<br>
over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among<br>
us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an<br>
altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.</p>

<p>22:20. Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the<br>
Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but<br>
one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.</p>

<p>22:21. And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of<br>
Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:</p>

<p>22:22. The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he<br>
knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design of<br>
transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish<br>
us immediately:</p>

<p>22:23. And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it<br>
holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him<br>
require and judge:</p>

<p>22:24. And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say:<br>
To morrow your children will say to our children: What have you to do<br>
with the Lord the God of Israel?</p>

<p>22:25. The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and<br>
you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you<br>
have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion your children shall turn<br>
away our children from the fear of the Lord. &nbsp;We therefore thought it<br>
best,</p>

<p>22:26. And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to<br>
offer victims,</p>

<p>22:27. But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and<br>
yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer<br>
both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that<br>
your children to morrow may not say to our children: You have no part in<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>22:28. And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar<br>
of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for<br>
sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.</p>

<p>22:29. God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from<br>
the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to<br>
offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the<br>
Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.</p>

<p>22:30. And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage,<br>
who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they<br>
admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and<br>
of the half tribe of Manasses,</p>

<p>22:31. And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we<br>
know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this<br>
revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>22:32. And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and<br>
Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the<br>
children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p>

<p>22:33. And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the children of<br>
Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up<br>
against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.</p>

<p>22:34. And the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad called the<br>
altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God,</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 23</p>

<p>Josue being old admonisheth the people to keep God's commandments: and<br>
to avoid marriages and all society with the Gentiles for fear of being<br>
brought to idolatry.</p>

<p>23:1. And when a long time was passed, after that the Lord had given<br>
peace to Israel, all the nations round about being subdued and Josue<br>
being now old, and far advanced in years:</p>

<p>23:2. Josue called for all Israel, and for the elders, and for the<br>
princes, and for the judges, and for the masters, and said to them: I am<br>
old, and far advanced in years,</p>

<p>23:3. And you see all that the Lord your God hath done to all the<br>
nations round about, how he himself hath fought for you:</p>

<p>23:4. And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land, from the<br>
east of the Jordan unto the great sea, ant many nations yet remain:</p>

<p>23:5. The Lord your God will destroy them, and take them away from<br>
before your face, and you shall possess the land as he hath promised<br>
you.</p>

<p>23:6. Only take courage, and be careful to observe all things that are<br>
written in the book of the law of Moses: and turn not aside from them<br>
neither to the right hand nor to the left:</p>

<p>23:7. Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles, who will<br>
remain among you, you should swear by the name of their gods, and serve<br>
them, and adore them:</p>

<p>23:8. But cleave ye unto the Lord your God, as you have done until this<br>
day.</p>

<p>23:9. And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that<br>
are great and very strong, and no man shall be able to resist you.</p>

<p>23:10. One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies: because the<br>
Lord your God himself will fight for you, as he hath promised.</p>

<p>23:11. This only take care of with all diligence, that you love the Lord<br>
your God.</p>

<p>23:12. But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell<br>
among you, and make marriages with them, and join friendships:</p>

<p>23:13. Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy<br>
them before your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way,<br>
and a stumbling-block at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he<br>
take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he<br>
hath given you.</p>

<p>23:14. Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you<br>
shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord<br>
promised to perform for you, not one hath failed,</p>

<p>23:15. Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he promised, and all<br>
things prosperous have come: so will he bring upon you all the evils he<br>
hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off this<br>
excellent land, which he hath given you,</p>

<p>23:16. When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your<br>
God, which he hath made with you, and shall have served strange gods,<br>
and adored them: then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly<br>
and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this<br>
excellent land, which he hath delivered to you.</p>

<p>Josue Chapter 24</p>

<p>Josue assembleth the people, and reneweth the covenant between them and<br>
God. His death and burial.</p>

<p>24:1. And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Israel in Sichem,<br>
and called for the ancients, and the princes and the judges, and the<br>
masters: and they stood in the sight of the Lord:</p>

<p>24:2. And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the Lord the God of<br>
Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Thare<br>
the father of Abraham, and Nachor: and they served strange gods.</p>

<p>Of the river... The Euphrates.</p>

<p>24:3. And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia:<br>
and brought him into the land of Chanaan: and I multiplied his seed,</p>

<p>24:4. And gave him Isaac: and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau. And I<br>
gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and his children<br>
went down into Egypt.</p>

<p>24:5. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many signs and<br>
wonders.</p>

<p>24:6. And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to<br>
the sea: and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and<br>
horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.</p>

<p>24:7. And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: and he put darkness<br>
between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and<br>
covered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in<br>
the wilderness a long time.</p>

<p>24:8. And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite, who dwelt beyond<br>
the Jordan. And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your<br>
hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.</p>

<p>24:9. And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought against<br>
Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:</p>

<p>24:10. And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I blessed you by<br>
him, and I delivered you out of his hand.</p>

<p>24:11. And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho. &nbsp;And the<br>
men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite,<br>
and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite,<br>
and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.</p>

<p>24:12. And I sent before you and I drove them out from their places, the<br>
two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword nor with thy bow,</p>

<p>24:13. And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities<br>
to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you<br>
planted not.</p>

<p>24:14. Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect and<br>
most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers served in<br>
Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.</p>

<p>24:15. But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have your<br>
choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather<br>
serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the<br>
gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my<br>
house we will serve thee Lord,</p>

<p>24:16. And the people answered, and said, God forbid we should leave the<br>
Lord, and serve strange gods.</p>

<p>24:17. The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of<br>
Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great signs in our<br>
sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed, and among<br>
all the people through whom we passed.</p>

<p>24:18. And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the<br>
inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve<br>
the Lord, for he is our God.</p>

<p>24:19. And Josue said to the people: You will not be able to serve the<br>
Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive<br>
your wickedness and sins.</p>

<p>You will not be able to serve the Lord, etc... This was not said by way<br>
of discouraging them; but rather to make them more earnest and resolute,<br>
by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking, and the courage<br>
and constancy necessary to go through with it.</p>

<p>24:20. If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will turn, and<br>
will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good he hath done<br>
you.</p>

<p>24:21. And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not be so as thou<br>
sayest, but we will serve the Lord.</p>

<p>24:22. And Josue said to the people, You are witnesses, that you<br>
yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they answered: We<br>
are witnesses.</p>

<p>24:23. Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among you, and<br>
incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>

<p>24:24. And the people said to Josue: We will serve the Lord our God, and<br>
we will be obedient to his commandments.</p>

<p>24:25. Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the<br>
people commandments and judgments in Sichem.</p>

<p>24:26. And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the<br>
Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in<br>
the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>

<p>24:27. And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be a<br>
testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which<br>
he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and lie<br>
to the Lord your God.</p>

<p>It hath heard... This is a figure of speech, by which sensation is<br>
attributed to inanimate things; and they are called upon, as it were, to<br>
bear witness in favour of the great Creator, whom they on their part<br>
constantly obey.</p>

<p>24:28. And he sent the people away every one to their own possession,</p>

<p>24:29. And after these things Josue the son of Nun the servant of the<br>
Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:</p>

<p>And after, etc... If Josue wrote this book, as is commonly believed,<br>
these last verses were added by Samuel, or some other prophet.</p>

<p>24:30. And they buried him in the border of his possession in<br>
Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side of<br>
mount Gaas.</p>

<p>24:31. And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue, and of the<br>
ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known all the<br>
works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.</p>

<p>24:32. And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken<br>
out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the field which<br>
Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a<br>
hundred young ewes, and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph.</p>

<p>24:33. Eleazar also the son of Aaron died: and they buried him in<br>
Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount<br>
Ephraim.</p>

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
