<b>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</b>
</center><br>

<p class="one">My principal reason for undertaking the translation of Dr. Fritz
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s admirable work on the Crustacea, entitled &lsquo;F&uuml;r Darwin,&rsquo; was
that it was still, although published as long ago as 1864, and highly
esteemed by the author&rsquo;s scientific countrymen, absolutely unknown to a
great number of English naturalists, including some who have occupied
themselves more or less specially with the subjects of which it treats.
It possesses a value quite independent of its reference to Darwinism,
due to the number of highly interesting and important facts in the
natural history and particularly the developmental history of the
Crustacea, which its distinguished author, himself an unwearied and
original investigator of these matters, has brought together in it. To a
considerable section of English naturalists the tone adopted by the
author in speaking of one of the greatest of their number will be a
source of much gratification.</p>
<p>
In granting his permission for the translation of his little book, Dr.
Fritz M&uuml;ller kindly offered to send some emendations and additions to
certain parts of it. His notes included many corrections of printers'
errors, some of which would have proved unintelligible without his aid,
some small additions and notes which have been inserted in their proper
places, and two longer pieces, one forming a footnote near the close of
Chapter 11, the other at the end of Chapter 12, describing the probable
mode of evolution of the Rhizocephala from the Cirripedia.</p>
<p>
Of the execution of the translation I will say but little. My chief
object in this, as in other cases, has been to furnish, as nearly as
possible, a literal version of the original, regarding mere elegance of
expression as of secondary importance in a scientific work. As much of
Dr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s German does not submit itself to such treatment very
readily, I must beg his and the reader&rsquo;s indulgence for any
imperfections arising from this cause.</p>

<b>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</b>

<br>

<p class="one">
It is not the purpose of the following pages to discuss once more the
arguments deduced for and against Darwin&rsquo;s theory of the origin of
species, or to weigh them one against the other. Their object is simply
to indicate a few facts favourable to this theory, collected upon the
same South American ground, on which, as Darwin tells us, the idea first
occurred to him of devoting his attention to &ldquo;the origin of
species,&mdash;that mystery of mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
It is only by the accumulation of new and valuable material that the
controversy will gradually be brought into a state fit for final
decision, and this appears to be for the present of more importance than
a repeated analysis of what is already before us. Moreover, it is but
fair to leave it to Darwin himself at first to beat off the attacks of
his opponents from the splendid structure which he has raised with such
a master-hand.</p>
