<h1>
Jonah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Now the word of Yahweh
came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;Arise, go to Nineveh, that
great city, and preach against it, for their wickedness has come up before
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> But Jonah rose up to
flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh. He went down to Joppa, and
found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into
it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> But Yahweh sent out a great wind
on the sea, and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was
likely to break up.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Then
the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god. They threw the
cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten it. But Jonah had gone
down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he was laying down, and was
fast asleep.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> So the
shipmaster came to him, and said to him, &quot;What do you mean, sleeper?
Arise, call on your <a href="#N1">God</a>! Maybe your <a
href="#N2">God</a> will notice us, so that we won't perish.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> They all said to each
other, &quot;Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this
evil is on us.&quot; So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Then they asked him, &quot;Tell
us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation?
Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made
the sea and the dry land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Then were the men
exceedingly afraid, and said to him, &quot;What is this that you have
done?&quot; For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of
Yahweh, because he had told them.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Then said they to him, &quot;What
shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?&quot; For the sea grew
more and more stormy.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> He
said to them, &quot;Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea
will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Nevertheless the men
rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea
grew more and more stormy against them.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Therefore they cried to Yahweh,
and said, &quot;We beg you, Yahweh, we beg you, let us not perish for this
man's life, and don't lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done
as it pleased you.&quot;  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> So they took up Jonah, and threw
him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Then the men feared Yahweh
exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Yahweh prepared a
great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish
three days and three nights.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Then Jonah prayed to
Yahweh, his God, out of the fish's belly.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> He said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
<dd>He answered me.
<dt>Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.
<dd>You heard my voice.
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> For you threw me into
the depths,
<dd>in the heart of the seas.
<dt>The flood was all around me.
<dd>All your waves and your billows passed over me.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> I said, 'I have been
banished from your sight;
<dd>yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> The waters surrounded
me,
<dd>even to the soul.
<dt>The deep was around me.
<dd>The weeds were wrapped around my head.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> I went down to the
bottoms of the mountains.
<dd>The earth barred me in forever:
<dd>yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> &quot;When my soul
fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.
<dd>My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Those who regard lying
vanities forsake their own mercy.
<dd> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> But I will sacrifice
to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
<dd>I will pay that which I have vowed.
<dt>Salvation belongs to Yahweh.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Yahweh spoke to the
fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh came
to Jonah the second time, saying,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> &quot;Arise, go to Nineveh, that
great city, and preach to it the message that I give you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> So Jonah arose, and
went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was an
exceedingly great city, three days' journey across.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Jonah began to enter into the city
a day's journey, and he cried out, and said, &quot;Yet forty days, and
Nineveh shall be overthrown!&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> The people of Nineveh
believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the
greatest of them even to the least of them.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> The news reached the king of
Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe,
covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> He made a proclamation and
published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles,
saying, &quot;Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything;
let them not feed, nor drink water;  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> but let them be covered with
sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let
them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his
hands.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Who knows whether
God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that
we might not perish?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> God saw their works,
that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which
he said he would do to them, and he didn't do it.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> But it displeased Jonah
exceedingly, and he was angry.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> He prayed to Yahweh, and said,
&quot;Please, Yahweh, wasn't this what I said when I was still in my own
country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are
a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving
kindness, and you relent of doing harm.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg
you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;Is
it right for you to be angry?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Then Jonah went out of
the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a
booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become
of the city.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Yahweh God
prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a
shade over his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was
exceedingly glad because of the vine.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But God prepared a worm at dawn
the next day, and it chewed on the vine, so that it withered.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> It happened, when the sun arose,
that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head, so
that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said,
&quot;It is better for me to die than to live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> God said to Jonah,
&quot;Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am right to be angry, even to death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;You
have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored, neither
made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Shouldn't I be concerned for
Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty
thousand persons who can't discern between their right hand and their left
hand; and also much livestock?&quot;

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
