<h2>Captain Reece</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all the ships upon the blue,<br />No ship contained a better crew<br />Than
that of worthy CAPTAIN REECE,<br />Commanding of <i>The Mantelpiece</i>.</p>
<p>He was adored by all his men,<br />For worthy CAPTAIN REECE, R.N.,<br />Did
all that lay within him to<br />Promote the comfort of his crew.</p>
<p>If ever they were dull or sad,<br />Their captain danced to them
like mad,<br />Or told, to make the time pass by,<br />Droll legends
of his infancy.</p>
<p>A feather bed had every man,<br />Warm slippers and hot-water can,<br />Brown
windsor from the captain&rsquo;s store,<br />A valet, too, to every
four.</p>
<p>Did they with thirst in summer burn,<br />Lo, seltzogenes at every
turn,<br />And on all very sultry days<br />Cream ices handed round
on trays.</p>
<p>Then currant wine and ginger pops<br />Stood handily on all the &ldquo;tops;&rdquo;<br />And
also, with amusement rife,<br />A &ldquo;Zoetrope, or Wheel of Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New volumes came across the sea<br />From MISTER MUDIE&rsquo;S libraree;<br /><i>The
Times</i> and<i> Saturday Review<br /></i>Beguiled the leisure of the
crew.</p>
<p>Kind-hearted CAPTAIN REECE, R.N.,<br />Was quite devoted to his men;<br />In
point of fact, good CAPTAIN REECE<br />Beatified <i>The Mantelpiece.</i></p>
<p>One summer eve, at half-past ten,<br />He said (addressing all his
men):<br />&ldquo;Come, tell me, please, what I can do<br />To please
and gratify my crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By any reasonable plan<br />I&rsquo;ll make you happy if I
can;<br />My own convenience count as <i>nil</i>:<br />It is my duty,
and I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and answered WILLIAM LEE<br />(The kindly captain&rsquo;s
coxswain he,<br />A nervous, shy, low-spoken man),<br />He cleared his
throat and thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a daughter, CAPTAIN REECE,<br />Ten female cousins
and a niece,<br />A Ma, if what I&rsquo;m told is true,<br />Six sisters,
and an aunt or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, somehow, sir, it seems to me,<br />More friendly-like
we all should be,<br />If you united of &rsquo;em to<br />Unmarried
members of the crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d ameliorate our life,<br />Let each select from
them a wife;<br />And as for nervous me, old pal,<br />Give me your
own enchanting gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good CAPTAIN REECE, that worthy man,<br />Debated on his coxswain&rsquo;s
plan:<br />&ldquo;I quite agree,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;O BILL;<br />It
is my duty, and I will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter, that enchanting gurl,<br />Has just been promised
to an Earl,<br />And all my other familee<br />To peers of various degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are dukes and viscounts to<br />The happiness of
all my crew?<br />The word I gave you I&rsquo;ll fulfil;<br />It is
my duty, and I will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you desire it shall befall,<br />I&rsquo;ll settle thousands
on you all,<br />And I shall be, despite my hoard,<br />The only bachelor
on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatswain of <i>The Mantelpiece,<br /></i>He blushed and spoke
to CAPTAIN REECE:<br />&ldquo;I beg your honour&rsquo;s leave,&rdquo;
he said;<br />&ldquo;If you would wish to go and wed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a widowed mother who<br />Would be the very thing for
you&mdash;<br />She long has loved you from afar:<br />She washes for
you, CAPTAIN R.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain saw the dame that day&mdash;<br />Addressed her in his
playful way&mdash;<br />&ldquo;And did it want a wedding ring?<br />It
was a tempting ickle sing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, the chaplain I will seek,<br />We&rsquo;ll all
be married this day week<br />At yonder church upon the hill;<br />It
is my duty, and I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters, cousins, aunts, and niece,<br />And widowed Ma of CAPTAIN
REECE,<br />Attended there as they were bid;<br />It was their duty,
and they did.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>The Rival Curates</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>List while the poet trolls<br />Of MR. CLAYTON HOOPER,<br />Who had
a cure of souls<br />At Spiffton-extra-Sooper.</p>
<p>He lived on curds and whey,<br />And daily sang their praises,<br />And
then he&rsquo;d go and play<br />With buttercups and daisies.</p>
<p>Wild croqu&ecirc;t HOOPER banned,<br />And all the sports of Mammon,<br />He
warred with cribbage, and<br />He exorcised backgammon.</p>
<p>His helmet was a glance<br />That spoke of holy gladness;<br />A
saintly smile his lance;<br />His shield a tear of sadness.</p>
<p>His Vicar smiled to see<br />This armour on him buckled:<br />With
pardonable glee<br />He blessed himself and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In mildness to abound<br />My curate&rsquo;s sole design is;<br />In
all the country round<br />There&rsquo;s none so mild as mine is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And HOOPER, disinclined<br />His trumpet to be blowing,<br />Yet
didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d find<br />A milder curate going.</p>
<p>A friend arrived one day<br />At Spiffton-extra-Sooper,<br />And
in this shameful way<br />He spoke to Mr. HOOPER:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think your famous name<br />For mildness can&rsquo;t be
shaken,<br />That none can blot your fame&mdash;<br />But, HOOPER, you&rsquo;re
mistaken!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mind is not as blank<br />As that of HOPLEY PORTER,<br />Who
holds a curate&rsquo;s rank<br />At Assesmilk-cum-Worter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> plays the airy flute,<br />And looks depressed and
blighted,<br />Doves round about him &lsquo;toot,&rsquo;<br />And lambkins
dance delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> labours more than you<br />At worsted work, and
frames it;<br />In old maids&rsquo; albums, too,<br />Sticks seaweed&mdash;yes,
and names it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tempter said his say,<br />Which pierced him like a needle&mdash;<br />He
summoned straight away<br />His sexton and his beadle.</p>
<p>(These men were men who could<br />Hold liberal opinions:<br />On
Sundays they were good&mdash;<br />On week-days they were minions.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;To HOPLEY PORTER go,<br />Your fare I will afford you&mdash;<br />&nbsp;Deal
him a deadly blow,<br />And blessings shall reward you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay&mdash;I do not like<br />Undue assassination,<br />And
so before you strike,<br />Make this communication:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him this one chance&mdash;<br />If he&rsquo;ll
more gaily bear him,<br />Play croqu&ecirc;t, smoke, and dance,<br />I
willingly will spare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went, those minions true,<br />To Assesmilk-cum-Worter,<br />And
told their errand to<br />The REVEREND HOPLEY PORTER.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said that reverend gent,<br />&ldquo;Dance through
my hours of leisure?<br />Smoke?&mdash;bathe myself with scent?&mdash;<br />Play
croqu&ecirc;t?&nbsp; Oh, with pleasure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear all my hair in curl?<br />Stand at my door and wink&mdash;so&mdash;<br />At
every passing girl?<br />My brothers, I should think so!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years I&rsquo;ve longed for some<br />Excuse for this
revulsion:<br />Now that excuse has come&mdash;<br />I do it on compulsion!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smoked and winked away&mdash;<br />This REVEREND HOPLEY PORTER&mdash;<br />The
deuce there was to pay<br />At Assesmilk-cum-Worter.</p>
<p>And HOOPER holds his ground,<br />In mildness daily growing&mdash;<br />They
think him, all around,<br />The mildest curate going.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>Only A Dancing Girl</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Only a dancing girl,<br />With an unromantic style,<br />With borrowed
colour and curl,<br />With fixed mechanical smile,<br />With many a
hackneyed wile,<br />With ungrammatical lips,<br />And corns that mar
her trips.</p>
<p>Hung from the &ldquo;flies&rdquo; in air,<br />She acts a palpable
lie,<br />She&rsquo;s as little a fairy there<br />As unpoetical I!<br />I
hear you asking, Why&mdash;<br />Why in the world I sing<br />This tawdry,
tinselled thing?</p>
<p>No airy fairy she,<br />As she hangs in arsenic green<br />From a
highly impossible tree<br />In a highly impossible scene<br />(Herself
not over-clean).<br />For fays don&rsquo;t suffer, I&rsquo;m told,<br />From
bunions, coughs, or cold.</p>
<p>And stately dames that bring<br />Their daughters there to see,<br />Pronounce
the &ldquo;dancing thing&rdquo;<br />No better than she should be,<br />With
her skirt at her shameful knee,<br />And her painted, tainted phiz:<br />Ah,
matron, which of us is?</p>
<p>(And, in sooth, it oft occurs<br />That while these matrons sigh,<br />Their
dresses are lower than hers,<br />And sometimes half as high;<br />And
their hair is hair they buy,<br />And they use their glasses, too,<br />In
a way she&rsquo;d blush to do.)</p>
<p>But change her gold and green<br />For a coarse merino gown,<br />And
see her upon the scene<br />Of her home, when coaxing down<br />Her
drunken father&rsquo;s frown,<br />In his squalid cheerless den:<br />She&rsquo;s
a fairy truly, then!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>General John</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The bravest names for fire and flames<br />And all that mortal durst,<br />Were
GENERAL JOHN and PRIVATE JAMES,<br />Of the Sixty-seventy-first.</p>
<p>GENERAL JOHN was a soldier tried,<br />A chief of warlike dons;<br />A
haughty stride and a withering pride<br />Were MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN&rsquo;S.</p>
<p>A sneer would play on his martial phiz,<br />Superior birth to show;<br />&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo;
was a favourite word of his,<br />And he often said &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FULL-PRIVATE JAMES described might be,<br />As a man of a mournful
mind;<br />No characteristic trait had he<br />Of any distinctive kind.</p>
<p>From the ranks, one day, cried PRIVATE JAMES,<br />&ldquo;Oh! MAJOR-GENERAL
JOHN,<br />I&rsquo;ve doubts of our respective names,<br />My mournful
mind upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A glimmering thought occurs to me<br />(Its source I can&rsquo;t
unearth),<br />But I&rsquo;ve a kind of a notion we<br />Were cruelly
changed at birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a strange idea that each other&rsquo;s names<br />We&rsquo;ve
each of us here got on.<br />Such things have been,&rdquo; said PRIVATE
JAMES.<br />&ldquo;They have!&rdquo; sneered GENERAL JOHN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My GENERAL JOHN, I swear upon<br />My oath I think &rsquo;tis
so&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; proudly sneered his GENERAL
JOHN,<br />And he also said &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My GENERAL JOHN! my GENERAL JOHN!<br />My GENERAL JOHN!&rdquo;
quoth he,<br />&ldquo;This aristocratical sneer upon<br />Your face
I blush to see!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No truly great or generous cove<br />Deserving of them names,<br />Would
sneer at a fixed idea that&rsquo;s drove<br />In the mind of a PRIVATE
JAMES!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said GENERAL JOHN, &ldquo;Upon your claims<br />No need your breath
to waste;<br />If this is a joke, FULL-PRIVATE JAMES,<br />It&rsquo;s
a joke of doubtful taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, being a man of doubtless worth,<br />If you feel certain
quite<br />That we were probably changed at birth,<br />I&rsquo;ll venture
to say you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So GENERAL JOHN as PRIVATE JAMES<br />Fell in, parade upon;<br />And
PRIVATE JAMES, by change of names,<br />Was MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>To A Little Maid&mdash;By A Policeman</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Come with me, little maid,<br />Nay, shrink not, thus afraid&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ll
harm thee not!<br />Fly not, my love, from me&mdash;<br />I have a home
for thee&mdash;<br />A fairy grot,<br />Where mortal eye<br />Can rarely
pry,<br />There shall thy dwelling be!</p>
<p>List to me, while I tell<br />The pleasures of that cell,<br />Oh,
little maid!<br />What though its couch be rude,<br />Homely the only
food<br />Within its shade?<br />No thought of care<br />Can enter there,<br />No
vulgar swain intrude!</p>
<p>Come with me, little maid,<br />Come to the rocky shade<br />I love
to sing;<br />Live with us, maiden rare&mdash;<br />Come, for we &ldquo;want&rdquo;
thee there,<br />Thou elfin thing,<br />To work thy spell,<br />In some
cool cell<br />In stately Pentonville!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>John And Freddy</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>JOHN courted lovely MARY ANN,<br />So likewise did his brother, FREDDY.<br />FRED
was a very soft young man,<br />While JOHN, though quick, was most unsteady.</p>
<p>FRED was a graceful kind of youth,<br />But JOHN was very much the
strongest.<br />&ldquo;Oh, dance away,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;in truth,<br />I&rsquo;ll
marry him who dances longest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JOHN tries the maiden&rsquo;s taste to strike<br />With gay, grotesque,
outrageous dresses,<br />And dances comically, like<br />CLODOCHE AND
Co., at the Princess&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But FREDDY tries another style,<br />He knows some graceful steps
and does &rsquo;em&mdash;<br />A breathing Poem&mdash;Woman&rsquo;s
smile&mdash;<br />A man all poesy and buzzem.</p>
<p>Now FREDDY&rsquo;S operatic <i>pas</i>&mdash;<br />Now JOHNNY&rsquo;S
hornpipe seems entrapping:<br />Now FREDDY&rsquo;S graceful <i>entrechats&mdash;<br /></i>Now
JOHNNY&rsquo;S skilful &ldquo;cellar-flapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many hours&mdash;for many days&mdash;<br />For many weeks performed
each brother,<br />For each was active in his ways,<br />And neither
would give in to t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p>After a month of this, they say<br />(The maid was getting bored
and moody)<br />A wandering curate passed that way<br />And talked a
lot of goody-goody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; said he, with solemn frown,<br />&ldquo;I tremble
for each dancing <i>frater</i>,<br />Like unregenerated clown<br />And
harlequin at some the-ayter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed that men, in dancing, do<br />Both impiously and absurdly,<br />And
proved his proposition true,<br />With Firstly, Secondly, and Thirdly.</p>
<p>For months both JOHN and FREDDY danced,<br />The curate&rsquo;s protests
little heeding;<br />For months the curate&rsquo;s words enhanced<br />The
sinfulness of their proceeding.</p>
<p>At length they bowed to Nature&rsquo;s rule&mdash;<br />Their steps
grew feeble and unsteady,<br />Till FREDDY fainted on a stool,<br />And
JOHNNY on the top of FREDDY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decide!&rdquo; quoth they, &ldquo;let him be named,<br />Who
henceforth as his wife may rank you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed
my views,&rdquo; the maiden said,<br />&ldquo;I only marry curates,
thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says FREDDY, &ldquo;Here is goings on!<br />To bust myself with rage
I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a curate!&rdquo; whispers
JOHN&mdash;<br />&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; exclaimed poetic FREDDY.</p>
<p>But while they read for it, these chaps,<br />The curate booked the
maiden bonny&mdash;<br />And when she&rsquo;s buried him, perhaps,<br />She&rsquo;ll
marry FREDERICK or JOHNNY.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>Sir Guy The Crusader</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Sir GUY was a doughty crusader,<br />A muscular knight,<br />Ever
ready to fight,<br />A very determined invader,<br />And DICKEY DE LION&rsquo;S
delight.</p>
<p>LENORE was a Saracen maiden,<br />Brunette, statuesque,<br />The
reverse of grotesque,<br />Her pa was a bagman from Aden,<br />Her mother
she played in burlesque.</p>
<p>A <i>coryph&eacute;e</i>, pretty and loyal,<br />In amber and red<br />The
ballet she led;<br />Her mother performed at the Royal,<br />LENORE
at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p>Of face and of figure majestic,<br />She dazzled the cits&mdash;<br />Ecstaticised
pits;&mdash;<br />Her troubles were only domestic,<br />But drove her
half out of her wits.</p>
<p>Her father incessantly lashed her,<br />On water and bread<br />She
was grudgingly fed;<br />Whenever her father he thrashed her<br />Her
mother sat down on her head.</p>
<p>GUY saw her, and loved her, with reason,<br />For beauty so bright<br />Sent
him mad with delight;<br />He purchased a stall for the season,<br />And
sat in it every night.</p>
<p>His views were exceedingly proper,<br />He wanted to wed,<br />So
he called at her shed<br />And saw her progenitor whop her&mdash;<br />Her
mother sit down on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So pretty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and so trusting!<br />You
brute of a dad,<br />You unprincipled cad,<br />Your conduct is really
disgusting,<br />Come, come, now admit it&rsquo;s too bad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a turbaned old Turk, and malignant&mdash;<br />Your
daughter LENORE<br />I intensely adore,<br />And I cannot help feeling
indignant,<br />A fact that I hinted before;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see a fond father employing<br />A deuce of a knout<br />For
to bang her about,<br />To a sensitive lover&rsquo;s annoying.&rdquo;<br />Said
the bagman, &ldquo;Crusader, get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says GUY, &ldquo;Shall a warrior laden<br />With a big spiky knob,<br />Sit
in peace on his cob<br />While a beautiful Saracen maiden<br />Is whipped
by a Saracen snob?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To London I&rsquo;ll go from my charmer.&rdquo;<br />Which
he did, with his loot<br />(Seven hats and a flute),<br />And was nabbed
for his Sydenham armour<br />At MR. BEN-SAMUEL&rsquo;S suit.</p>
<p>SIR GUY he was lodged in the Compter,<br />Her pa, in a rage,<br />Died
(don&rsquo;t know his age),<br />His daughter, she married the prompter,<br />Grew
bulky and quitted the stage.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>Haunted</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Haunted?&nbsp; Ay, in a social way<br />By a body of ghosts in dread
array;<br />But no conventional spectres they&mdash;<br />Appalling,
grim, and tricky:<br />I quail at mine as I&rsquo;d never quail<br />At
a fine traditional spectre pale,<br />With a turnip head and a ghostly
wail,<br />And a splash of blood on the dickey!</p>
<p>Mine are horrible, social ghosts,&mdash;<br />Speeches and women
and guests and hosts,<br />Weddings and morning calls and toasts,<br />In
every bad variety:<br />Ghosts who hover about the grave<br />Of all
that&rsquo;s manly, free, and brave:<br />You&rsquo;ll find their names
on the architrave<br />Of that charnel-house, Society.</p>
<p>Black Monday&mdash;black as its school-room ink&mdash;<br />With
its dismal boys that snivel and think<br />Of its nauseous messes to
eat and drink,<br />And its frozen tank to wash in.<br />That was the
first that brought me grief,<br />And made me weep, till I sought relief<br />In
an emblematical handkerchief,<br />To choke such baby bosh in.</p>
<p>First and worst in the grim array-<br />Ghosts of ghosts that have
gone their way,<br />Which I wouldn&rsquo;t revive for a single day<br />For
all the wealth of PLUTUS&mdash;<br />Are the horrible ghosts that school-days
scared:<br />If the classical ghost that BRUTUS dared<br />Was the ghost
of his &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; unprepared,<br />I&rsquo;m sure I pity BRUTUS.</p>
<p>I pass to critical seventeen;<br />The ghost of that terrible wedding
scene,<br />When an elderly Colonel stole my Queen,<br />And woke my
dream of heaven.<br />No schoolgirl decked in her nurse-room curls<br />Was
my gushing innocent Queen of Pearls;<br />If she wasn&rsquo;t a girl
of a thousand girls,<br />She was one of forty-seven!</p>
<p>I see the ghost of my first cigar,<br />Of the thence-arising family
jar&mdash;<br />Of my maiden brief (I was at the Bar,<br />And I called
the Judge &ldquo;Your wushup!&rdquo;)<br />Of reckless days and reckless
nights,<br />With wrenched-off knockers, extinguished lights,<br />Unholy
songs and tipsy fights,<br />Which I strove in vain to hush up.</p>
<p>Ghosts of fraudulent joint-stock banks,<br />Ghosts of &ldquo;copy,
declined with thanks,&rdquo;<br />Of novels returned in endless ranks,<br />And
thousands more, I suffer.<br />The only line to fitly grace<br />My
humble tomb, when I&rsquo;ve run my race,<br />Is, &ldquo;Reader, this
is the resting-place<br />Of an unsuccessful duffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fought them all, these ghosts of mine,<br />But the weapons
I&rsquo;ve used are sighs and brine,<br />And now that I&rsquo;m nearly
forty-nine,<br />Old age is my chiefest bogy;<br />For my hair is thinning
away at the crown,<br />And the silver fights with the worn-out brown;<br />And
a general verdict sets me down<br />As an irreclaimable fogy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>The Bishop And The &rsquo;Busman</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was a Bishop bold,<br />And London was his see,<br />He was short
and stout and round about<br />And zealous as could be.</p>
<p>It also was a Jew,<br />Who drove a Putney &rsquo;bus&mdash;<br />For
flesh of swine however fine<br />He did not care a cuss.</p>
<p>His name was HASH BAZ BEN,<br />And JEDEDIAH too,<br />And SOLOMON
and ZABULON&mdash;<br />This &rsquo;bus-directing Jew.</p>
<p>The Bishop said, said he,<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do<br />To
Christianise and make you wise,<br />You poor benighted Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So every blessed day<br />That &rsquo;bus he rode outside,<br />From
Fulham town, both up and down,<br />And loudly thus he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is HASH BAZ BEN,<br />And JEDEDIAH too,<br />And
SOLOMON and ZABULON&mdash;<br />This &rsquo;bus-directing Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the &rsquo;busman smiled,<br />And rather liked the fun&mdash;<br />He
merely smiled, that Hebrew child,<br />And said, &ldquo;Eccentric one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And gay young dogs would wait<br />To see the &rsquo;bus go by<br />(These
gay young dogs, in striking togs),<br />To hear the Bishop cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe his grisly beard,<br />His race it clearly shows,<br />He
sticks no fork in ham or pork&mdash;<br />Observe, my friends, his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is HASH BAZ BEN,<br />And JEDEDIAH too,<br />And
SOLOMON and ZABULON&mdash;<br />This &rsquo;bus-directing Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though at first amused,<br />Yet after seven years,<br />This
Hebrew child got rather riled,<br />And melted into tears.</p>
<p>He really almost feared<br />To leave his poor abode,<br />His nose,
and name, and beard became<br />A byword on that road.</p>
<p>At length he swore an oath,<br />The reason he would know&mdash;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
call and see why ever he<br />Does persecute me so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good old Bishop sat<br />On his ancestral chair,<br />The &rsquo;busman
came, sent up his name,<br />And laid his grievance bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benighted Jew,&rdquo; he said<br />(The good old Bishop did),<br />&ldquo;Be
Christian, you, instead of Jew&mdash;<br />Become a Christian kid!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er annoy you more.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
replied the Jew;<br />&ldquo;Shall I be freed?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
will, indeed!&rdquo;<br />Then &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The organ which, in man,<br />Between the eyebrows grows,<br />Fell
from his face, and in its place<br />He found a Christian nose.</p>
<p>His tangled Hebrew beard,<br />Which to his waist came down,<br />Was
now a pair of whiskers fair&mdash;<br />His name ADOLPHUS BROWN!</p>
<p>He wedded in a year<br />That prelate&rsquo;s daughter JANE,<br />He&rsquo;s
grown quite fair&mdash;has auburn hair&mdash;<br />His wife is far from
plain.</p>

<h2>The Troubadour</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A TROUBADOUR he played<br />Without a castle wall,<br />Within, a
hapless maid<br />Responded to his call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, willow, woe is me!<br />Alack and well-a-day!<br />If
I were only free<br />I&rsquo;d hie me far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unknown her face and name,<br />But this he knew right well,<br />The
maiden&rsquo;s wailing came<br />From out a dungeon cell.</p>
<p>A hapless woman lay<br />Within that dungeon grim&mdash;<br />That
fact, I&rsquo;ve heard him say,<br />Was quite enough for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not sit or lie,<br />Or eat or drink, I vow,<br />Till
thou art free as I,<br />Or I as pent as thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her tears then ceased to flow,<br />Her wails no longer rang,<br />And
tuneful in her woe<br />The prisoned maiden sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stranger, as you play,<br />I recognize your touch;<br />And
all that I can say<br />Is, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized his clarion straight,<br />And blew thereat, until<br />A
warden oped the gate.<br />&ldquo;Oh, what might be your will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come, Sir Knave, to see<br />The master of these
halls:<br />A maid unwillingly<br />Lies prisoned in their walls.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>With barely stifled sigh<br />That porter drooped his head,<br />With
teardrops in his eye,<br />&ldquo;A many, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He stayed to hear no more,<br />But pushed that porter by,<br />And
shortly stood before<br />SIR HUGH DE PECKHAM RYE.</p>
<p>SIR HUGH he darkly frowned,<br />&ldquo;What would you, sir, with
me?&rdquo;<br />The troubadour he downed<br />Upon his bended knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come, DE PECKHAM RYE,<br />To do a Christian task;<br />You
ask me what would I?<br />It is not much I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release these maidens, sir,<br />Whom you dominion o&rsquo;er&mdash;<br />Particularly
her<br />Upon the second floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t, my lord&rdquo;&mdash;<br />He here
stood bolt upright,<br />And tapped a tailor&rsquo;s sword&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Come
out, you cad, and fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>SIR HUGH he called&mdash;and ran<br />The warden from the gate:<br />&ldquo;Go,
show this gentleman<br />The maid in Forty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By many a cell they past,<br />And stopped at length before<br />A
portal, bolted fast:<br />The man unlocked the door.</p>
<p>He called inside the gate<br />With coarse and brutal shout,<br />&ldquo;Come,
step it, Forty-eight!&rdquo;<br />And Forty-eight stepped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gets it pretty hot,<br />The maidens what we cotch&mdash;<br />Two
years this lady&rsquo;s got<br />For collaring a wotch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah!&mdash;indeed&mdash;I see,&rdquo;<br />The troubadour
exclaimed&mdash;<br />&ldquo;If I may make so free,<br />How is this
castle named?</p>
<p>The warden&rsquo;s eyelids fill,<br />And sighing, he replied,<br />&ldquo;Of
gloomy Pentonville<br />This is the female side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minstrel did not wait<br />The Warden stout to thank,<br />But
recollected straight<br />He&rsquo;d business at the Bank.</p>

<h2>Ferdinando And Elvira; Or, The Gentle Pieman</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>PART I.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>At a pleasant evening party I had taken down to supper<br />One whom
I will call ELVIRA, and we talked of love and TUPPER,</p>
<p>MR. TUPPER and the Poets, very lightly with them dealing,<br />For
I&rsquo;ve always been distinguished for a strong poetic feeling.</p>
<p>Then we let off paper crackers, each of which contained a motto,<br />And
she listened while I read them, till her mother told her not to.</p>
<p>Then she whispered, &ldquo;To the ball-room we had better, dear,
be walking;<br />If we stop down here much longer, really people will
be talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were noblemen in coronets, and military cousins,<br />There
were captains by the hundred, there were baronets by dozens.</p>
<p>Yet she heeded not their offers, but dismissed them with a blessing,<br />Then
she let down all her back hair, which had taken long in dressing.</p>
<p>Then she had convulsive sobbings in her agitated throttle,<br />Then
she wiped her pretty eyes and smelt her pretty smelling-bottle.</p>
<p>So I whispered,&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear ELVIRA, say,&mdash;what can the
matter be with you?<br />Does anything you&rsquo;ve eaten, darling POPSY,
disagree with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But spite of all I said, her sobs grew more and more distressing,<br />And
she tore her pretty back hair, which had taken long in dressing.</p>
<p>Then she gazed upon the carpet, at the ceiling, then above me,<br />And
she whispered, &ldquo;FERDINANDO, do you really, <i>really</i> love
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you?&rdquo; said I, then I sighed, and then I gazed upon
her sweetly&mdash;<br />For I think I do this sort of thing particularly
neatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me to the Arctic regions, or illimitable azure,<br />On
a scientific goose-chase, with my COXWELL or my GLAISHER!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me whither I may hie me&mdash;tell me, dear one, that
I may know&mdash;<br />Is it up the highest Andes? down a horrible volcano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t polar bears, or hot volcanic
grottoes:<br />Only find out who it is that writes those lovely cracker
mottoes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>PART II.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, HENRY WADSWORTH, ALFRED POET CLOSE, or MISTER TUPPER,<br />Do
you write the bon bon mottoes my ELVIRA pulls at supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But HENRY WADSWORTH smiled, and said he had not had that honour;<br />And
ALFRED, too, disclaimed the words that told so much upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MISTER MARTIN TUPPER, POET CLOSE, I beg of you inform us;&rdquo;<br />But
my question seemed to throw them both into a rage enormous.</p>
<p>MISTER CLOSE expressed a wish that he could only get anigh to me;<br />And
MISTER MARTIN TUPPER sent the following reply to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool is bent upon a twig, but wise men dread a bandit,&rdquo;&mdash;<br />Which
I know was very clever; but I didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Seven weary years I wandered&mdash;Patagonia, China, Norway,<br />Till
at last I sank exhausted at a pastrycook his doorway.</p>
<p>There were fuchsias and geraniums, and daffodils and myrtle,<br />So
I entered, and I ordered half a basin of mock turtle.</p>
<p>He was plump and he was chubby, he was smooth and he was rosy,<br />And
his little wife was pretty and particularly cosy.</p>
<p>And he chirped and sang, and skipped about, and laughed with laughter
hearty&mdash;<br />He was wonderfully active for so very stout a party.</p>
<p>And I said, &ldquo;O gentle pieman, why so very, very merry?<br />Is
it purity of conscience, or your one-and-seven sherry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy&mdash;no profession could
be dearer&mdash;<br />If I am not humming &lsquo;Tra! la! la!&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m singing &lsquo;Tirer, lirer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I go and make the patties, and the puddings, and the
jellies,<br />Then I make a sugar bird-cage, which upon a table swell
is;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I polish all the silver, which a supper-table lacquers;<br />Then
I write the pretty mottoes which you find inside the crackers.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found at last!&rdquo; I madly shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentle
pieman, you astound me!&rdquo;<br />Then I waved the turtle soup enthusiastically
round me.</p>
<p>And I shouted and I danced until he&rsquo;d quite a crowd around
him&mdash;<br />And I rushed away exclaiming, &ldquo;I have found him!&nbsp;
I have found him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I heard the gentle pieman in the road behind me trilling,<br />&ldquo;&lsquo;Tira,
lira!&rsquo; stop him, stop him!&nbsp; &lsquo;Tra! la! la!&rsquo; the
soup&rsquo;s a shilling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But until I reached ELVIRA&rsquo;S home, I never, never waited,<br />And
ELVIRA to her FERDINAND&rsquo;S irrevocably mated!</p>

<h2>Lorenzo De Lardy</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>DALILAH DE DARDY adored<br />The very correctest of cards,<br />LORENZO
DE LARDY, a lord&mdash;<br />He was one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Guards.</p>
<p>DALILAH DE DARDY was fat,<br />DALILAH DE DARDY was old&mdash;<br />(No
doubt in the world about that)<br />But DALILAH DE DARDY had gold.</p>
<p>LORENZO DE LARDY was tall,<br />The flower of maidenly pets,<br />Young
ladies would love at his call,<br />But LORENZO DE LARDY had debts.</p>
<p>His money-position was queer,<br />And one of his favourite freaks<br />Was
to hide himself three times a year,<br />In Paris, for several weeks.</p>
<p>Many days didn&rsquo;t pass him before<br />He fanned himself into
a flame,<br />For a beautiful &ldquo;DAM DU COMPTWORE,&rdquo;<br />And
this was her singular name:</p>
<p>ALICE EULALIE CORALINE<br />EUPHROSINE COLOMBINA TH&Eacute;R&Egrave;SE<br />JULIETTE
STEPHANIE CELESTINE<br />CHARLOTTE RUSSE DE LA SAUCE MAYONNAISE.</p>
<p>She booked all the orders and tin,<br />Accoutred in showy fal-lal,<br />At
a two-fifty Restaurant, in<br />The glittering Palais Royal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d gaze in her orbit of blue,<br />Her hand he would tenderly
squeeze,<br />But the words of her tongue that he knew<br />Were limited
strictly to these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;CORALINE CELESTINE EULALIE,<br />Houp l&agrave;!&nbsp; Je
vous aime, oui, mossoo,<br />Combien donnez moi aujourd&rsquo;hui<br />Bonjour,
Mademoiselle, parlez voo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MADEMOISELLE DE LA SAUCE MAYONNAISE<br />Was a witty and beautiful
miss,<br />Extremely correct in her ways,<br />But her English consisted
of this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! pretty man, if you please,<br />Blom boodin, biftek,
currie lamb,<br />Bouldogue, two franc half, quite ze cheese,<br />Rosbif,
me spik Angleesh, godam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A waiter, for seasons before,<br />Had basked in her beautiful gaze,<br />And
burnt to dismember MILOR,<br /><i>He loved</i> DE LA SAUCE MAYONNAISE.</p>
<p>He said to her, &ldquo;M&eacute;chante TH&Eacute;R&Egrave;SE,<br />Avec
d&eacute;sespoir tu m&rsquo;accables.<br />Penses-tu, DE LA SAUCE MAYONNAISE,<br />Ses
intentions sont honorables?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flirtez toujours, ma belle, si tu &ocirc;ses&mdash;<br />Je
me vengerai ainsi, ma ch&egrave;re,<br /><i>Je lui dirai de quoi l&rsquo;on
compose<br />Vol au vent &agrave; la Financi&egrave;re</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>LORD LARDY knew nothing of this&mdash;<br />The waiter&rsquo;s devotion
ignored,<br />But he gazed on the beautiful miss,<br />And never seemed
weary or bored.</p>
<p>The waiter would screw up his nerve,<br />His fingers he&rsquo;d
snap and he&rsquo;d dance&mdash;<br />And LORD LARDY would smile and
observe,<br />&ldquo;How strange are the customs of France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, after delaying a space,<br />His tradesmen no longer would
wait:<br />Returning to England apace,<br />He yielded himself to his
fate.</p>
<p>LORD LARDY espoused, with a groan,<br />MISS DARDY&rsquo;S developing
charms,<br />And agreed to tag on to his own,<br />Her name and her
newly-found arms.</p>
<p>The waiter he knelt at the toes<br />Of an ugly and thin coryph&eacute;e,<br />Who
danced in the hindermost rows<br />At the Th&eacute;atre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s.</p>
<p>MADEMOISELLE DE LA SAUCE MAYONNAISE<br />Didn&rsquo;t yield to a
gnawing despair<br />But married a soldier, and plays<br />As a pretty
and pert Vivandi&egrave;re.</p>

<h2>Disillusioned&mdash;By An Ex-Enthusiast</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Oh, that my soul its gods could see<br />As years ago they seemed
to me<br />When first I painted them;<br />Invested with the circumstance<br />Of
old conventional romance:<br />Exploded theorem!</p>
<p>The bard who could, all men above,<br />Inflame my soul with songs
of love,<br />And, with his verse, inspire<br />The craven soul who
feared to die<br />With all the glow of chivalry<br />And old heroic
fire;</p>
<p>I found him in a beerhouse tap<br />Awaking from a gin-born nap,<br />With
pipe and sloven dress;<br />Amusing chums, who fooled his bent,<br />With
muddy, maudlin sentiment,<br />And tipsy foolishness!</p>
<p>The novelist, whose painting pen<br />To legions of fictitious men<br />A
real existence lends,<br />Brain-people whom we rarely fail,<br />Whene&rsquo;er
we hear their names, to hail<br />As old and welcome friends;</p>
<p>I found in clumsy snuffy suit,<br />In seedy glove, and blucher boot,<br />Uncomfortably
big.<br />Particularly commonplace,<br />With vulgar, coarse, stockbroking
face,<br />And spectacles and wig.</p>
<p>My favourite actor who, at will,<br />With mimic woe my eyes could
fill<br />With unaccustomed brine:<br />A being who appeared to me<br />(Before
I knew him well) to be<br />A song incarnadine;</p>
<p>I found a coarse unpleasant man<br />With speckled chin&mdash;unhealthy,
wan&mdash;<br />Of self-importance full:<br />Existing in an atmosphere<br />That
reeked of gin and pipes and beer&mdash;<br />Conceited, fractious, dull.</p>
<p>The warrior whose ennobled name<br />Is woven with his country&rsquo;s
fame,<br />Triumphant over all,<br />I found weak, palsied, bloated,
blear;<br />His province seemed to be, to leer<br />At bonnets in Pall
Mall.</p>
<p>Would that ye always shone, who write,<br />Bathed in your own innate
limelight,<br />And ye who battles wage,<br />Or that in darkness I
had died<br />Before my soul had ever sighed<br />To see you off the
stage!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>Babette&rsquo;s Love</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>BABETTE she was a fisher gal,<br />With jupon striped and cap in
crimps.<br />She passed her days inside the Halle,<br />Or catching
little nimble shrimps.<br />Yet she was sweet as flowers in May,<br />With
no professional bouquet.</p>
<p>JACOT was, of the Customs bold,<br />An officer, at gay Boulogne,<br />He
loved BABETTE&mdash;his love he told,<br />And sighed, &ldquo;Oh, soyez
vous my own!&rdquo;<br />But &ldquo;Non!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;JACOT,
my pet,<br />Vous &ecirc;tes trop scraggy pour BABETTE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of one alone I nightly dream,<br />An able mariner is he,<br />And
gaily serves the Gen&rsquo;ral Steam-<br />Boat Navigation Companee.<br />I&rsquo;ll
marry him, if he but will&mdash;<br />His name, I rather think, is BILL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him when he&rsquo;s not aware,<br />Upon our hospitable
coast,<br />Reclining with an easy air<br />Upon the <i>Port</i> against
a post,<br />A-thinking of, I&rsquo;ll dare to say,<br />His native
Chelsea far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mon!&rdquo; exclaimed the Customs bold,<br />&ldquo;Mes
yeux!&rdquo; he said (which means &ldquo;my eye&rdquo;)<br />&ldquo;Oh,
ch&egrave;re!&rdquo; he also cried, I&rsquo;m told,<br />&ldquo;Par
Jove,&rdquo; he added, with a sigh.<br />&ldquo;Oh, mon! oh, ch&egrave;re!
mes yeux! par Jove!<br />Je n&rsquo;aime pas cet enticing cove!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Panther&rsquo;s</i> captain stood hard by,<br />He was a man
of morals strict<br />If e&rsquo;er a sailor winked his eye,<br />Straightway
he had that sailor licked,<br />Mast-headed all (such was his code)<br />Who
dashed or jiggered, blessed or blowed.</p>
<p>He wept to think a tar of his<br />Should lean so gracefully on posts,<br />He
sighed and sobbed to think of this,<br />On foreign, French, and friendly
coasts.<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s human natur&rsquo;, p&rsquo;raps&mdash;if
so,<br />Oh, isn&rsquo;t human natur&rsquo; low!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called his BILL, who pulled his curl,<br />He said, &ldquo;My
BILL, I understand<br />You&rsquo;ve captivated some young gurl<br />On
this here French and foreign land.<br />Her tender heart your beauties
jog&mdash;<br />They do, you know they do, you dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a graceful way, I learn,<br />Of leaning airily on
posts,<br />By which you&rsquo;ve been and caused to burn<br />A tender
flame on these here coasts.<br />A fisher gurl, I much regret,&mdash;<br />Her
age, sixteen&mdash;her name, BABETTE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry her, you gentle tar&mdash;<br />Your union
I myself will bless,<br />And when you matrimonied are,<br />I will
appoint her stewardess.&rdquo;<br />But WILLIAM hitched himself and
sighed,<br />And cleared his throat, and thus replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so: unless you&rsquo;re fond of strife,<br />You&rsquo;d
better mind your own affairs,<br />I have an able-bodied wife<br />Awaiting
me at Wapping Stairs;<br />If all this here to her I tell,<br />She&rsquo;ll
larrup you and me as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skin-deep, and valued at a pin,<br />Is beauty such as VENUS
owns&mdash;<br /><i>Her</i> beauty is beneath her skin,<br />And lies
in layers on her bones.<br />The other sailors of the crew<br />They
always calls her &lsquo;Whopping Sue!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; the Captain said, &ldquo;I see!<br />And is she
then so very strong?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;She&rsquo;d take your honour&rsquo;s
scruff,&rdquo; said he<br />&ldquo;And pitch you over to Bolong!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I
pardon you,&rdquo; the Captain said,<br />&ldquo;The fair BABETTE you
needn&rsquo;t wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the Customs had his will,<br />And coaxed the scornful girl
to wed,<br />Perhaps the Captain and his BILL,<br />And WILLIAM&rsquo;S
little wife are dead;<br />Or p&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;re all alive and
well:<br />I cannot, cannot, cannot tell.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>To My Bride&mdash;(Whoever She May Be)</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Oh! little maid!&mdash;(I do not know your name<br />Or who you are,
so, as a safe precaution<br />I&rsquo;ll add)&mdash;Oh, buxom widow!
married dame!<br />(As one of these must be your present portion)<br />Listen,
while I unveil prophetic lore for you,<br />And sing the fate that Fortune
has in store for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll marry soon&mdash;within a year or twain&mdash;<br />A
bachelor of <i>circa</i> two and thirty:<br />Tall, gentlemanly, but
extremely plain,<br />And when you&rsquo;re intimate, you&rsquo;ll call
him &ldquo;BERTIE.&rdquo;<br />Neat&mdash;dresses well; his temper has
been classified<br />As hasty; but he&rsquo;s very quickly pacified.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find him working mildly at the Bar,<br />After a touch
at two or three professions,<br />From easy affluence extremely far,<br />A
brief or two on Circuit&mdash;&ldquo;soup&rdquo; at Sessions;<br />A
pound or two from whist and backing horses,<br />And, say three hundred
from his own resources.</p>
<p>Quiet in harness; free from serious vice,<br />His faults are not
particularly shady,<br />You&rsquo;ll never find him &ldquo;<i>shy</i>&rdquo;&mdash;for,
once or twice<br />Already, he&rsquo;s been driven by a lady,<br />Who
parts with him&mdash;perhaps a poor excuse for him&mdash;<br />Because
she hasn&rsquo;t any further use for him.</p>
<p>Oh! bride of mine&mdash;tall, dumpy, dark, or fair!<br />Oh! widow&mdash;wife,
maybe, or blushing maiden,<br />I&rsquo;ve told <i>your</i> fortune;
solved the gravest care<br />With which your mind has hitherto been
laden.<br />I&rsquo;ve prophesied correctly, never doubt it;<br />Now
tell me mine&mdash;and please be quick about it!</p>
<p>You&mdash;only you&mdash;can tell me, an&rsquo; you will,<br />To
whom I&rsquo;m destined shortly to be mated,<br />Will she run up a
heavy <i>modiste&rsquo;s</i> bill?<br />If so, I want to hear her income
stated<br />(This is a point which interests me greatly).<br />To quote
the bard, &ldquo;Oh! have I seen her lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, must I wait till husband number one<br />Is comfortably stowed
away at Woking?<br />How is her hair most usually done?<br />And tell
me, please, will she object to smoking?<br />The colour of her eyes,
too, you may mention:<br />Come, Sibyl, prophesy&mdash;I&rsquo;m all
attention.</p>

<h2>The Folly Of Brown&mdash;By A General Agent</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I knew a boor&mdash;a clownish card<br />(His only friends were pigs
and cows and<br />The poultry of a small farmyard),<br />Who came into
two hundred thousand.</p>
<p>Good fortune worked no change in BROWN,<br />Though she&rsquo;s a
mighty social chymist;<br />He was a clown&mdash;and by a clown<br />I
do not mean a pantomimist.</p>
<p>It left him quiet, calm, and cool,<br />Though hardly knowing what
a crown was&mdash;<br />You can&rsquo;t imagine what a fool<br />Poor
rich uneducated BROWN was!</p>
<p>He scouted all who wished to come<br />And give him monetary schooling;<br />And
I propose to give you some<br />Idea of his insensate fooling.</p>
<p>I formed a company or two&mdash;<br />(Of course I don&rsquo;t know
what the rest meant,<br />I formed them solely with a view<br />To help
him to a sound investment).</p>
<p>Their objects were&mdash;their only cares&mdash;<br />To justify
their Boards in showing<br />A handsome dividend on shares<br />And
keep their good promoter going.</p>
<p>But no&mdash;the lout sticks to his brass,<br />Though shares at
par I freely proffer:<br />Yet&mdash;will it be believed?&mdash;the
ass<br />Declines, with thanks, my well-meant offer!</p>
<p>He adds, with bumpkin&rsquo;s stolid grin<br />(A weakly intellect
denoting),<br />He&rsquo;d rather not invest it in<br />A company of
my promoting!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two hundred &lsquo;thou&rsquo; or more,&rdquo;<br />Said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll waste it, lose it, lend it;<br />Come,
take my furnished second floor,<br />I&rsquo;ll gladly show you how
to spend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But will it be believed that he,<br />With grin upon his face of
poppy,<br />Declined my aid, while thanking me<br />For what he called
my &ldquo;philanthroppy&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Some blind, suspicious fools rejoice<br />In doubting friends who
wouldn&rsquo;t harm them;<br />They will not hear the charmer&rsquo;s
voice,<br />However wisely he may charm them!</p>
<p>I showed him that his coat, all dust,<br />Top boots and cords provoked
compassion,<br />And proved that men of station must<br />Conform to
the decrees of fashion.</p>
<p>I showed him where to buy his hat<br />To coat him, trouser him,
and boot him;<br />But no&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of that&mdash;<br />&ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t think the style would suit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I offered him a county seat,<br />And made no end of an oration;<br />I
made it certainty complete,<br />And introduced the deputation.</p>
<p>But no&mdash;the clown my prospect blights&mdash;<br />(The worth
of birth it surely teaches!)<br />&ldquo;Why should I want to spend
my nights<br />In Parliament, a-making speeches?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t never been to school&mdash;<br />I ain&rsquo;t
had not no eddication&mdash;<br />And I should surely be a fool<br />To
publish that to all the nation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I offered him a trotting horse&mdash;<br />No hack had ever trotted
faster&mdash;<br />I also offered him, of course,<br />A rare and curious
&ldquo;old master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I offered to procure him weeds&mdash;<br />Wines fit for one in his
position&mdash;<br />But, though an ass in all his deeds,<br />He&rsquo;d
learnt the meaning of &ldquo;commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called me &ldquo;thief&rdquo; the other day,<br />And daily from
his door he thrusts me;<br />Much more of this, and soon I may<br />Begin
to think that BROWN mistrusts me.</p>
<p>So deaf to all sound Reason&rsquo;s rule<br />This poor uneducated
clown is,<br />You can<i>not</i> fancy what a fool<br />Poor rich uneducated
BROWN is.</p>

<h2>Sir Macklin</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all the youths I ever saw<br />None were so wicked, vain, or silly,<br />So
lost to shame and Sabbath law,<br />As worldly TOM, and BOB, and BILLY.</p>
<p>For every Sabbath day they walked<br />(Such was their gay and thoughtless
natur)<br />In parks or gardens, where they talked<br />From three to
six, or even later.</p>
<p>SIR MACKLIN was a priest severe<br />In conduct and in conversation,<br />It
did a sinner good to hear<br />Him deal in ratiocination.</p>
<p>He could in every action show<br />Some sin, and nobody could doubt
him.<br />He argued high, he argued low,<br />He also argued round about
him.</p>
<p>He wept to think each thoughtless youth<br />Contained of wickedness
a skinful,<br />And burnt to teach the awful truth,<br />That walking
out on Sunday&rsquo;s sinful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, youths,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I grieve to find<br />The
course of life you&rsquo;ve been and hit on&mdash;<br />Sit down,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and never mind<br />The pennies for the chairs you sit
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opening head is &lsquo;Kensington,&rsquo;<br />How walking
there the sinner hardens,<br />Which when I have enlarged upon,<br />I
go to &lsquo;Secondly&rsquo;&mdash;its &lsquo;Gardens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My &lsquo;Thirdly&rsquo; comprehendeth &lsquo;Hyde,&rsquo;<br />Of
Secresy the guilts and shameses;<br />My &lsquo;Fourthly&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Park&rsquo;&mdash;its
verdure wide&mdash;<br />My &lsquo;Fifthly&rsquo; comprehends &lsquo;St.
James&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That matter settled, I shall reach<br />The &lsquo;Sixthly&rsquo;
in my solemn tether,<br />And show that what is true of each,<br />Is
also true of all, together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall demonstrate to you,<br />According to the rules
of WHATELY,<br />That what is true of all, is true<br />Of each, considered
separately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In lavish stream his accents flow,<br />TOM, BOB, and BILLY dare
not flout him;<br />He argued high, he argued low,<br />He also argued
round about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you loathe your ways,<br />You
writhe at these my words of warning,<br />In agony your hands you raise.&rdquo;<br />(And
so they did, for they were yawning.)</p>
<p>To &ldquo;Twenty-firstly&rdquo; on they go,<br />The lads do not
attempt to scout him;<br />He argued high, he argued low,<br />He also
argued round about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;you bow your crests&mdash;<br />My
eloquence has set you weeping;<br />In shame you bend upon your breasts!&rdquo;<br />(And
so they did, for they were sleeping.)</p>
<p>He proved them this&mdash;he proved them that&mdash;<br />This good
but wearisome ascetic;<br />He jumped and thumped upon his hat,<br />He
was so very energetic.</p>
<p>His Bishop at this moment chanced<br />To pass, and found the road
encumbered;<br />He noticed how the Churchman danced,<br />And how his
congregation slumbered.</p>
<p>The hundred and eleventh head<br />The priest completed of his stricture;<br />&ldquo;Oh,
bosh!&rdquo; the worthy Bishop said,<br />And walked him off as in the
picture.</p>

<h2>The Yarn Of The &ldquo;Nancy Bell&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&rsquo;Twas on the shores that round our coast<br />From Deal to
Ramsgate span,<br />That I found alone on a piece of stone<br />An elderly
naval man.</p>
<p>His hair was weedy, his beard was long,<br />And weedy and long was
he,<br />And I heard this wight on the shore recite,<br />In a singular
minor key:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br />And the mate of the
<i>Nancy</i> brig,<br />And a bo&rsquo;sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />And
the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,<br />Till I really felt
afraid,<br />For I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking the man had been drinking,<br />And
so I simply said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, elderly man, it&rsquo;s little I know<br />Of the duties
of men of the sea,<br />And I&rsquo;ll eat my hand if I understand<br />However
you can be</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once a cook, and a captain bold,<br />And the mate of the
<i>Nancy</i> brig,<br />And a bo&rsquo;sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />And
the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which<br />Is a trick all seamen
larn,<br />And having got rid of a thumping quid,<br />He spun this
painful yarn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the good ship <i>Nancy Bell<br /></i>That we
sailed to the Indian Sea,<br />And there on a reef we come to grief,<br />Which
has often occurred to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pretty nigh all the crew was drowned<br />(There was seventy-seven
o&rsquo; soul),<br />And only ten of the <i>Nancy&rsquo;s</i> men<br />Said
&lsquo;Here!&rsquo; to the muster-roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was me and the cook and the captain bold,<br />And the
mate of the <i>Nancy</i> brig,<br />And the bo&rsquo;sun tight, and
a midshipmite,<br />And the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a month we&rsquo;d neither wittles nor drink,<br />Till
a-hungry we did feel,<br />So we drawed a lot, and, accordin&rsquo;
shot<br />The captain for our meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next lot fell to the <i>Nancy&rsquo;s</i> mate,<br />And
a delicate dish he made;<br />Then our appetite with the midshipmite<br />We
seven survivors stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we murdered the bo&rsquo;sun tight,<br />And he much
resembled pig;<br />Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,<br />On
the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then only the cook and me was left,<br />And the delicate
question, &lsquo;Which<br />Of us two goes to the kettle?&rsquo; arose,<br />And
we argued it out as sich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,<br />And the cook
he worshipped me;<br />But we&rsquo;d both be blowed if we&rsquo;d either
be stowed<br />In the other chap&rsquo;s hold, you see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be eat if you dines off me,&rsquo; says
TOM;<br />&lsquo;Yes, that,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be,&mdash;<br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
boiled if I die, my friend,&rsquo; quoth I;<br />And &lsquo;Exactly
so,&rsquo; quoth he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says he, &lsquo;Dear JAMES, to murder me<br />Were a foolish
thing to do,<br />For don&rsquo;t you see that you can&rsquo;t cook
<i>me</i>,<br />While I can&mdash;and will&mdash;cook <i>you</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he boils the water, and takes the salt<br />And the pepper
in portions true<br />(Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot.<br />And
some sage and parsley too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; says he, with a proper pride,<br />Which
his smiling features tell,<br />&lsquo;&rsquo;T will soothing be if
I let you see<br />How extremely nice you&rsquo;ll smell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he stirred it round and round and round,<br />And he sniffed
at the foaming froth;<br />When I ups with his heels, and smothers his
squeals<br />In the scum of the boiling broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I eat that cook in a week or less,<br />And&mdash;as I
eating be<br />The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,<br />For
a wessel in sight I see!</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never larf, and I never smile,<br />And I never lark
nor play,<br />But sit and croak, and a single joke<br />I have&mdash;which
is to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br />And the mate of the
<i>Nancy</i> brig,<br />And a bo&rsquo;sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />And
the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Bishop Of Rum-Ti-Foo</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>From east and south the holy clan<br />Of Bishops gathered to a man;<br />To
Synod, called Pan-Anglican,<br />In flocking crowds they came.<br />Among
them was a Bishop, who<br />Had lately been appointed to<br />The balmy
isle of Rum-ti-Foo,<br />And PETER was his name.</p>
<p>His people&mdash;twenty-three in sum&mdash;<br />They played the
eloquent tum-tum,<br />And lived on scalps served up, in rum&mdash;<br />The
only sauce they knew.<br />When first good BISHOP PETER came<br />(For
PETER was that Bishop&rsquo;s name),<br />To humour them, he did the
same<br />As they of Rum-ti-Foo.</p>
<p>His flock, I&rsquo;ve often heard him tell,<br />(His name was PETER)
loved him well,<br />And, summoned by the sound of bell,<br />In crowds
together came.<br />&ldquo;Oh, massa, why you go away?<br />Oh, MASSA
PETER, please to stay.&rdquo;<br />(They called him PETER, people say,<br />Because
it was his name.)</p>
<p>He told them all good boys to be,<br />And sailed away across the
sea,<br />At London Bridge that Bishop he<br />Arrived one Tuesday night;<br />And
as that night he homeward strode<br />To his Pan-Anglican abode,<br />He
passed along the Borough Road,<br />And saw a gruesome sight.</p>
<p>He saw a crowd assembled round<br />A person dancing on the ground,<br />Who
straight began to leap and bound<br />With all his might and main.<br />To
see that dancing man he stopped,<br />Who twirled and wriggled, skipped
and hopped,<br />Then down incontinently dropped,<br />And then sprang
up again.</p>
<p>The Bishop chuckled at the sight.<br />&ldquo;This style of dancing
would delight<br />A simple Rum-ti-Foozleite.<br />I&rsquo;ll learn
it if I can,<br />To please the tribe when I get back.&rdquo;<br />He
begged the man to teach his knack.<br />&ldquo;Right Reverend Sir, in
half a crack!<br />Replied that dancing man.</p>
<p>The dancing man he worked away,<br />And taught the Bishop every
day&mdash;<br />The dancer skipped like any fay&mdash;<br />Good PETER
did the same.<br />The Bishop buckled to his task,<br />With <i>battements</i>,
and <i>pas de basque.<br /></i>(I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you care to
ask,<br />That PETER was his name.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, walk like this,&rdquo; the dancer said,<br />&ldquo;Stick
out your toes&mdash;stick in your head,<br />Stalk on with quick, galvanic
tread&mdash;<br />Your fingers thus extend;<br />The attitude&rsquo;s
considered quaint.&rdquo;<br />The weary Bishop, feeling faint,<br />Replied,
&ldquo;I do not say it ain&rsquo;t,<br />But &lsquo;Time!&rsquo; my
Christian friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now proceed to something new&mdash;<br />Dance as the PAYNES
and LAURIS do,<br />Like this&mdash;one, two&mdash;one, two&mdash;one,
two.&rdquo;<br />The Bishop, never proud,<br />But in an overwhelming
heat<br />(His name was PETER, I repeat)<br />Performed the PAYNE and
LAURI feat,<br />And puffed his thanks aloud.</p>
<p>Another game the dancer planned&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Just take your
ankle in your hand,<br />And try, my lord, if you can stand&mdash;<br />Your
body stiff and stark.<br />If, when revisiting your see,<br />You learnt
to hop on shore&mdash;like me&mdash;<br />The novelty would striking
be,<br />And must attract remark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the worthy Bishop, &ldquo;no;<br />That is
a length to which, I trow,<br />Colonial Bishops cannot go.<br />You
may express surprise<br />At finding Bishops deal in pride&mdash;<br />But
if that trick I ever tried,<br />I should appear undignified<br />In
Rum-ti-Foozle&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The islanders of Rum-ti-Foo<br />Are well-conducted persons,
who<br />Approve a joke as much as you,<br />And laugh at it as such;<br />But
if they saw their Bishop land,<br />His leg supported in his hand,<br />The
joke they wouldn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;<br />&rsquo;T would pain
them very much!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Precocious Baby.&nbsp; A Very True Tale</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(<i>To be sung to the Air of the &ldquo;Whistling Oyster</i>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>An elderly person&mdash;a prophet by trade&mdash;<br />With his quips
and tips<br />On withered old lips,<br />He married a young and a beautiful
maid;<br />The cunning old blade!<br />Though rather decayed,<br />He
married a beautiful, beautiful maid.</p>
<p>She was only eighteen, and as fair as could be,<br />With her tempting
smiles<br />And maidenly wiles,<br />And he was a trifle past seventy-three:<br />Now
what she could see<br />Is a puzzle to me,<br />In a prophet of seventy&mdash;seventy-three!</p>
<p>Of all their acquaintances bidden (or bad)<br />With their loud high
jinks<br />And underbred winks,<br />None thought they&rsquo;d a family
have&mdash;but they had;<br />A dear little lad<br />Who drove &rsquo;em
half mad,<br />For he turned out a horribly fast little cad.</p>
<p>For when he was born he astonished all by,<br />With their &ldquo;Law,
dear me!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Did ever you see?&rdquo;<br />He&rsquo;d
a pipe in his mouth and a glass in his eye,<br />A hat all awry&mdash;<br />An
octagon tie&mdash;<br />And a miniature&mdash;miniature glass in his
eye.</p>
<p>He grumbled at wearing a frock and a cap,<br />With his &ldquo;Oh,
dear, oh!&rdquo;<br />And his &ldquo;Hang it! &rsquo;oo know!&rdquo;<br />And
he turned up his nose at his excellent pap&mdash;<br />&ldquo;My friends,
it&rsquo;s a tap<br />Dat is not worf a rap.&rdquo;<br />(Now this was
remarkably excellent pap.)</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d chuck his nurse under the chin, and he&rsquo;d say,<br />With
his &ldquo;Fal, lal, lal&rdquo;&mdash;<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo doosed
fine gal!&rdquo;<br />This shocking precocity drove &rsquo;em away:<br />&ldquo;A
month from to-day<br />Is as long as I&rsquo;ll stay&mdash;<br />Then
I&rsquo;d wish, if you please, for to toddle away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father, a simple old gentleman, he<br />With nursery rhyme<br />And
&ldquo;Once on a time,&rdquo;<br />Would tell him the story of &ldquo;Little
Bo-P,&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;So pretty was she,<br />So pretty and wee,<br />As
pretty, as pretty, as pretty could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the babe, with a dig that would startle an ox,<br />With his
&ldquo;C&rsquo;ck!&nbsp; Oh, my!&mdash;<br />Go along wiz &rsquo;oo,
fie!&rdquo;<br />Would exclaim, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid &rsquo;oo a
socking ole fox.&rdquo;<br />Now a father it shocks,<br />And it whitens
his locks,<br />When his little babe calls him a shocking old fox.</p>
<p>The name of his father he&rsquo;d couple and pair<br />(With his
ill-bred laugh,<br />And insolent chaff)<br />With those of the nursery
heroines rare&mdash;<br />Virginia the Fair,<br />Or Good Goldenhair,<br />Till
the nuisance was more than a prophet could bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Jill and White Cat&rdquo; (said the bold little
brat,<br />With his loud, &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo;)<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo
sly ickle Pa!<br />Wiz &rsquo;oo Beauty, Bo-Peep, and &rsquo;oo Mrs.
Jack Sprat!<br />I&rsquo;ve noticed &rsquo;oo pat<br /><i>My</i> pretty
White Cat&mdash;<br />I sink dear mamma ought to know about dat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He early determined to marry and wive,<br />For better or worse<br />With
his elderly nurse&mdash;<br />Which the poor little boy didn&rsquo;t
live to contrive:<br />His hearth didn&rsquo;t thrive&mdash;<br />No
longer alive,<br />He died an enfeebled old dotard at five!</p>
<p>MORAL.</p>
<p>Now, elderly men of the bachelor crew,<br />With wrinkled hose<br />And
spectacled nose,<br />Don&rsquo;t marry at all&mdash;you may take it
as true<br />If ever you do<br />The step you will rue,<br />For your
babes will be elderly&mdash;elderly too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentle, modest little flower,<br />Sweet epitome of May,<br />Love

so fiercely flaming<br />In your tiny shell-like ear,<br />I should
always be exclaiming<br />If I loved you, PHOEBE dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smiles that thrill from any distance<br />Shed upon me while
I sing!<br />Please ecstaticize existence,<br />Love me, oh, thou fairy
thing!&rdquo;<br />Words like these, outpouring sadly<br />You&rsquo;d
perpetually hear,<br />If I loved you fondly, madly;&mdash;<br />But

<h2>Baines Carew, Gentleman</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all the good attorneys who<br />Have placed their names upon the
roll,<br />But few could equal BAINES CAREW<br />For tender-heartedness
and soul.</p>
<p>Whene&rsquo;er he heard a tale of woe<br />From client A or client
B,<br />His grief would overcome him so<br />He&rsquo;d scarce have
strength to take his fee.</p>
<p>It laid him up for many days,<br />When duty led him to distrain,<br />And
serving writs, although it pays,<br />Gave him excruciating pain.</p>
<p>He made out costs, distrained for rent,<br />Foreclosed and sued,
with moistened eye&mdash;<br />No bill of costs could represent<br />The
value of such sympathy.</p>
<p>No charges can approximate<br />The worth of sympathy with woe;&mdash;<br />Although
I think I ought to state<br />He did his best to make them so.</p>
<p>Of all the many clients who<br />Had mustered round his legal flag,<br />No
single client of the crew<br />Was half so dear as CAPTAIN BAGG.</p>
<p>Now, CAPTAIN BAGG had bowed him to<br />A heavy matrimonial yoke&mdash;<br />His
wifey had of faults a few&mdash;<br />She never could resist a joke.</p>
<p>Her chaff at first he meekly bore,<br />Till unendurable it grew.<br />&ldquo;To
stop this persecution sore<br />I will consult my friend CAREW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when CAREW&rsquo;S advice I&rsquo;ve got,<br />Divorce
<i>a mens&acirc;</i> I shall try.&rdquo;<br />(A legal separation&mdash;not<br /><i>A
vinculo conjugii</i>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, BAINES CAREW, my woe I&rsquo;ve kept<br />A secret hitherto,
you know;&rdquo;&mdash;<br />(And BAINES CAREW, ESQUIRE, he wept<br />To
hear that BAGG <i>had</i> any woe.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;My case, indeed, is passing sad.<br />My wife&mdash;whom I
considered true&mdash;<br />With brutal conduct drives me mad.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I
am appalled,&rdquo; said BAINES CAREW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! sound the matrimonial knell<br />Of worthy people such
as these!<br />Why was I an attorney?&nbsp; Well&mdash;<br />Go on to
the <i>saevitia</i>, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domestic bliss has proved my bane,&mdash;<br />A harder case
you never heard,<br />My wife (in other matters sane)<br />Pretends
that I&rsquo;m a Dicky bird!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes me sing, &lsquo;Too-whit, too-wee!&rsquo;<br />And
stand upon a rounded stick,<br />And always introduces me<br />To every
one as &lsquo;Pretty Dick&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; said weeping BAINES CAREW,<br />&ldquo;This
is the direst case I know.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grieved,&rdquo;
said BAGG, &ldquo;at paining you&mdash;<br />&ldquo;To COBB and POLTHERTHWAITE
I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To COBB&rsquo;S cold, calculating ear,<br />My gruesome sorrows
I&rsquo;ll impart&rdquo;&mdash;<br />&ldquo;No; stop,&rdquo; said BAINES,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dry my tear,<br />And steel my sympathetic heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes me perch upon a tree,<br />Rewarding me with &lsquo;Sweety&mdash;nice!&rsquo;<br />And
threatens to exhibit me<br />With four or five performing mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restrain my tears I wish I could&rdquo;<br />(Said BAINES),
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;<br />Said CAPTAIN BAGG,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo;
said BAINES CAREW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes me fire a gun,&rdquo; said BAGG;<br />&ldquo;And,
at a preconcerted word,<br />Climb up a ladder with a flag,<br />Like
any street performing bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She places sugar in my way&mdash;<br />In public places calls
me &lsquo;Sweet!&rsquo;<br />She gives me groundsel every day,<br />And
hard canary-seed to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, woe! oh, sad! oh, dire to tell!&rdquo;<br />(Said BAINES).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be good enough to stop.&rdquo;<br />And senseless on the floor
he fell,<br />With unpremeditated flop!</p>
<p>Said CAPTAIN BAGG, &ldquo;Well, really I<br />Am grieved to think
it pains you so.<br />I thank you for your sympathy;<br />But, hang
it!&mdash;come&mdash;I say, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But BAINES lay flat upon the floor,<br />Convulsed with sympathetic
sob;&mdash;<br />The Captain toddled off next door,<br />And gave the
case to MR. COBB.</p>

<h2>Thomas Winterbottom Hance</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In all the towns and cities fair<br />On Merry England&rsquo;s broad
expanse,<br />No swordsman ever could compare<br />With THOMAS WINTERBOTTOM
HANCE.</p>
<p>The dauntless lad could fairly hew<br />A silken handkerchief in
twain,<br />Divide a leg of mutton too&mdash;<br />And this without
unwholesome strain.</p>
<p>On whole half-sheep, with cunning trick,<br />His sabre sometimes
he&rsquo;d employ&mdash;<br />No bar of lead, however thick,<br />Had
terrors for the stalwart boy.</p>
<p>At Dover daily he&rsquo;d prepare<br />To hew and slash, behind,
before&mdash;<br />Which aggravated MONSIEUR PIERRE,<br />Who watched
him from the Calais shore.</p>
<p>It caused good PIERRE to swear and dance,<br />The sight annoyed
and vexed him so;<br />He was the bravest man in France&mdash;<br />He
said so, and he ought to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regardez donc, ce cochon gros&mdash;<br />Ce polisson!&nbsp;
Oh, sacr&eacute; bleu!<br />Son sabre, son plomb, et ses gigots<br />Comme
cela m&rsquo;ennuye, enfin, mon Dieu!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il sait que les foulards de soie<br />Give no retaliating
whack&mdash;<br />Les gigots morts n&rsquo;ont pas de quoi&mdash;<br />Le
plomb don&rsquo;t ever hit you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But every day the headstrong lad<br />Cut lead and mutton more and
more;<br />And every day poor PIERRE, half mad,<br />Shrieked loud defiance
from his shore.</p>
<p>HANCE had a mother, poor and old,<br />A simple, harmless village
dame,<br />Who crowed and clapped as people told<br />Of WINTERBOTTOM&rsquo;S
rising fame.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be upon the spot<br />To see my TOMMY&rsquo;S
sabre-play;&rdquo;<br />And so she left her leafy cot,<br />And walked
to Dover in a day.</p>
<p>PIERRE had a doating mother, who<br />Had heard of his defiant rage;<br /><i>His</i>
Ma was nearly ninety-two,<br />And rather dressy for her age.</p>
<p>At HANCE&rsquo;S doings every morn,<br />With sheer delight <i>his</i>
mother cried;<br />And MONSIEUR PIERRE&rsquo;S contemptuous scorn<br />Filled
<i>his</i> mamma with proper pride.</p>
<p>But HANCE&rsquo;S powers began to fail&mdash;<br />His constitution
was not strong&mdash;<br />And PIERRE, who once was stout and hale,<br />Grew
thin from shouting all day long.</p>
<p>Their mothers saw them pale and wan,<br />Maternal anguish tore each
breast,<br />And so they met to find a plan<br />To set their offsprings&rsquo;
minds at rest.</p>
<p>Said MRS. HANCE, &ldquo;Of course I shrinks<br />From bloodshed,
ma&rsquo;am, as you&rsquo;re aware,<br />But still they&rsquo;d better
meet, I thinks.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Assur&eacute;ment!&rdquo; said MADAME
PIERRE.</p>
<p>A sunny spot in sunny France<br />Was hit upon for this affair;<br />The
ground was picked by MRS. HANCE,<br />The stakes were pitched by MADAME
PIERRE.</p>
<p>Said MRS. H., &ldquo;Your work you see&mdash;<br />Go in, my noble
boy, and win.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;En garde, mon fils!&rdquo; said MADAME
P.<br />&ldquo;Allons!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;En
garde!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The mothers were of decent size,<br />Though not particularly tall;<br />But
in the sketch that meets your eyes<br />I&rsquo;ve been obliged to draw
them small.)</p>
<p>Loud sneered the doughty man of France,<br />&ldquo;Ho! ho!&nbsp;
Ho! ho!&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; Ha! ha!<br />&ldquo;The French for &lsquo;Pish&rsquo;&rdquo;
said THOMAS HANCE.<br />Said PIERRE, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Anglais, Monsieur,
pour &lsquo;Bah.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said MRS. H., &ldquo;Come, one! two! three!&mdash;<br />We&rsquo;re
sittin&rsquo; here to see all fair.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;C&rsquo;est magnifique!&rdquo;
said MADAME P.,<br />&ldquo;Mais, parbleu! ce n&rsquo;est pas la guerre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je scorn un foe si lache que vous,&rdquo;<br />Said PIERRE,
the doughty son of France.<br />&ldquo;I fight not coward foe like you!&rdquo;<br />Said
our undaunted TOMMY HANCE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French for &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo;&rdquo; our TOMMY cried.<br />&ldquo;L&rsquo;Anglais
pour &lsquo;Va!&rsquo;&rdquo; the Frenchman crowed.<br />And so, with
undiminished pride,<br />Each went on his respective road.</p>

<h2>The Reverend Micah Sowls</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The REVEREND MICAH SOWLS,<br />He shouts and yells and howls,<br />He
screams, he mouths, he bumps,<br />He foams, he rants, he thumps.</p>
<p>His armour he has buckled on, to wage<br />The regulation war against
the Stage;<br />And warns his congregation all to shun<br />&ldquo;The
Presence-Chamber of the Evil One,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject&rsquo;s sad enough<br />To make him rant and puff,<br />And
fortunately, too,<br />His Bishop&rsquo;s in a pew.</p>
<p>So REVEREND MICAH claps on extra steam,<br />His eyes are flashing
with superior gleam,<br />He is as energetic as can be,<br />For there
are fatter livings in that see.</p>
<p>The Bishop, when it&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er,<br />Goes through the vestry
door,<br />Where MICAH, very red,<br />Is mopping of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my Lord, your SOWLS&rsquo; excessive zeal,<br />It
is a theme on which I strongly feel.&rdquo;<br />(The sermon somebody
had sent him down<br />From London, at a charge of half-a-crown.)</p>
<p>The Bishop bowed his head,<br />And, acquiescing, said,<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard your well-meant rage<br />Against the Modern Stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A modern Theatre, as I heard you say,<br />Sows seeds of evil
broadcast&mdash;well it may;<br />But let me ask you, my respected son,<br />Pray,
have you ever ventured into one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said MICAH, &ldquo;no!<br />I never, never
go!<br />What!&nbsp; Go and see a play?<br />My goodness gracious, nay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy Bishop said, &ldquo;My friend, no doubt<br />The Stage
may be the place you make it out;<br />But if, my REVEREND SOWLS, you
never go,<br />I don&rsquo;t quite understand how you&rsquo;re to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; MICAH said,<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often
heard and read,<br />But never go&mdash;do you?&rdquo;<br />The Bishop
said, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves me wrong,&rdquo; said MICAH, in a trice:<br />&ldquo;I
thought it all frivolity and vice.&rdquo;<br />The Bishop handed him
a printed card;<br />&ldquo;Go to a theatre where they play our Bard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop took his leave,<br />Rejoicing in his sleeve.<br />The
next ensuing day<br />SOWLS went and heard a play.</p>
<p>He saw a dreary person on the stage,<br />Who mouthed and mugged
in simulated rage,<br />Who growled and spluttered in a mode absurd,<br />And
spoke an English SOWLS had never heard.</p>
<p>For &ldquo;gaunt&rdquo; was spoken &ldquo;garnt,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;And
&ldquo;haunt&rdquo; transformed to &ldquo;harnt,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;And
&ldquo;wrath &ldquo; pronounced as &ldquo;rath,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;And
&ldquo;death&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;dath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For hours and hours that dismal actor walked,<br />And talked, and
talked, and talked, and talked,<br />Till lethargy upon the parson crept,<br />And
sleepy MICAH SOWLS serenely slept.</p>
<p>He slept away until<br />The farce that closed the bill<br />Had
warned him not to stay,<br />And then he went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought <i>my</i> gait ridiculous,&rdquo; said he&mdash;<br />&ldquo;<i>My</i>
elocution faulty as could be;<br />I thought <i>I</i> mumbled on a matchless
plan&mdash;<br />I had not seen our great Tragedian!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, if you can,<br />O great Tragedian!<br />I own
it with a sigh&mdash;<br />You&rsquo;re drearier than I!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A Discontented Sugar Broker</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A GENTLEMAN of City fame<br />Now claims your kind attention;<br />East
India broking was his game,<br />His name I shall not mention:<br />No
one of finely-pointed sense<br />Would violate a confidence,<br />And
shall <i>I</i> go<br />And do it?&nbsp; No!<br />His name I shall not
mention.</p>
<p>He had a trusty wife and true,<br />And very cosy quarters,<br />A
manager, a boy or two,<br />Six clerks, and seven porters.<br />A broker
must be doing well<br />(As any lunatic can tell)<br />Who can employ<br />An
active boy,<br />Six clerks, and seven porters.</p>
<p>His knocker advertised no dun,<br />No losses made him sulky,<br />He
had one sorrow&mdash;only one&mdash;<br />He was extremely bulky.<br />A
man must be, I beg to state,<br />Exceptionally fortunate<br />Who owns
his chief<br />And only grief<br />Is&mdash;being very bulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This load,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I cannot bear;<br />I&rsquo;m
nineteen stone or twenty!<br />Henceforward I&rsquo;ll go in for air<br />And
exercise in plenty.&rdquo;<br />Most people think that, should it come,<br />They
can reduce a bulging tum<br />To measures fair<br />By taking air<br />And
exercise in plenty.</p>
<p>In every weather, every day,<br />Dry, muddy, wet, or gritty,<br />He
took to dancing all the way<br />From Brompton to the City.<br />You
do not often get the chance<br />Of seeing sugar brokers dance<br />From
their abode<br />In Fulham Road<br />Through Brompton to the City.</p>
<p>He braved the gay and guileless laugh<br />Of children with their
nusses,<br />The loud uneducated chaff<br />Of clerks on omnibuses.<br />Against
all minor things that rack<br />A nicely-balanced mind, I&rsquo;ll back<br />The
noisy chaff<br />And ill-bred laugh<br />Of clerks on omnibuses.</p>
<p>His friends, who heard his money chink,<br />And saw the house he
rented,<br />And knew his wife, could never think<br />What made him
discontented.<br />It never entered their pure minds<br />That fads
are of eccentric kinds,<br />Nor would they own<br />That fat alone<br />Could
make one discontented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your riches know no kind of pause,<br />Your trade is fast
advancing;<br />You dance&mdash;but not for joy, because<br />You weep
as you are dancing.<br />To dance implies that man is glad,<br />To
weep implies that man is sad;<br />But here are you<br />Who do the
two&mdash;<br />You weep as you are dancing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mania soon got noised about<br />And into all the papers;<br />His
size increased beyond a doubt<br />For all his reckless capers:<br />It
may seem singular to you,<br />But all his friends admit it true&mdash;<br />The
more he found<br />His figure round,<br />The more he cut his capers.</p>
<p>His bulk increased&mdash;no matter that&mdash;<br />He tried the
more to toss it&mdash;<br />He never spoke of it as &ldquo;fat,&rdquo;<br />But
&ldquo;adipose deposit.&rdquo;<br />Upon my word, it seems to me<br />Unpardonable
vanity<br />(And worse than that)<br />To call your fat<br />An &ldquo;adipose
deposit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length his brawny knees gave way,<br />And on the carpet sinking,<br />Upon
his shapeless back he lay<br />And kicked away like winking.<br />Instead
of seeing in his state<br />The finger of unswerving Fate,<br />He laboured
still<br />To work his will,<br />And kicked away like winking.</p>
<p>His friends, disgusted with him now,<br />Away in silence wended&mdash;<br />I
hardly like to tell you how<br />This dreadful story ended.<br />The
shocking sequel to impart,<br />I must employ the limner&rsquo;s art&mdash;<br />If
you would know,<br />This sketch will show<br />How his exertions ended.</p>
<p>MORAL.</p>
<p>I hate to preach&mdash;I hate to prate&mdash;<br />- I&rsquo;m no
fanatic croaker,<br />But learn contentment from the fate<br />Of this
East India broker.<br />He&rsquo;d everything a man of taste<br />Could
ever want, except a waist;<br />And discontent<br />His size anent,<br />And
bootless perseverance blind,<br />Completely wrecked the peace of mind<br />Of
this East India broker.</p>

<h2>The Force Of Argument</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Lord B. was a nobleman bold<br />Who came of illustrious stocks,<br />He
was thirty or forty years old,<br />And several feet in his socks.</p>
<p>To Turniptopville-by-the-Sea<br />This elegant nobleman went,<br />For
that was a borough that he<br />Was anxious to rep-per-re-sent.</p>
<p>At local assemblies he danced<br />Until he felt thoroughly ill;<br />He
waltzed, and he galoped, and lanced,<br />And threaded the mazy quadrille.</p>
<p>The maidens of Turniptopville<br />Were simple&mdash;ingenuous&mdash;pure&mdash;<br />And
they all worked away with a will<br />The nobleman&rsquo;s heart to
secure.</p>
<p>Two maidens all others beyond<br />Endeavoured his cares to dispel&mdash;<br />The
one was the lively ANN POND,<br />The other sad MARY MORELL.</p>
<p>ANN POND had determined to try<br />And carry the Earl with a rush;<br />Her
principal feature was eye,<br />Her greatest accomplishment&mdash;gush.</p>
<p>And MARY chose this for her play:<br />Whenever he looked in her
eye<br />She&rsquo;d blush and turn quickly away,<br />And flitter,
and flutter, and sigh.</p>
<p>It was noticed he constantly sighed<br />As she worked out the scheme
she had planned,<br />A fact he endeavoured to hide<br />With his aristocratical
hand.</p>
<p>Old POND was a farmer, they say,<br />And so was old TOMMY MORELL.<br />In
a humble and pottering way<br />They were doing exceedingly well.</p>
<p>They both of them carried by vote<br />The Earl was a dangerous man;<br />So
nervously clearing his throat,<br />One morning old TOMMY began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darter&rsquo;s no pratty young doll&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;m
a plain-spoken Zommerzet man&mdash;<br />Now what do &rsquo;ee mean
by my POLL,<br />And what do &rsquo;ee mean by his ANN?</p>
<p>Said B., &ldquo;I will give you my bond<br />I mean them uncommonly
well,<br />Believe me, my excellent POND,<br />And credit me, worthy
MORELL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite indisputable, for<br />I&rsquo;ll prove it
with singular ease,&mdash;<br />You shall have it in &lsquo;Barbara&rsquo;
or<br />&lsquo;Celarent&rsquo;&mdash;whichever you please.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, when an anchorite bows<br />To the yoke of intentional
sin,<br />If the state of the country allows,<br />Homogeny always steps
in&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a highly aesthetical bond,<br />As any mere ploughboy
can tell&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied puzzled
old POND.<br />&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said old TOMMY MORELL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, then,&rdquo; continued the lord;<br />&ldquo;When
it&rsquo;s fooled to the top of its bent,<br />With a sweep of a Damocles
sword<br />The web of intention is rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s patent to all of us here,<br />As any mere schoolboy
can tell.&rdquo;<br />POND answered, &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s quite
clear&rdquo;;<br />And so did that humbug MORELL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its tone&rsquo;s esoteric in force&mdash;<br />I trust that
I make myself clear?&rdquo;<br />MORELL only answered, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;<br />While
POND slowly muttered, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Volition&mdash;celestial prize,<br />Pellucid as porphyry
cell&mdash;<br />Is based on a principle wise.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Quite
so,&rdquo; exclaimed POND and MORELL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I have said you will see<br />That I couldn&rsquo;t
wed either&mdash;in fine,<br />By Nature&rsquo;s unchanging decree<br /><i>Your</i>
daughters could never be <i>mine.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home to your pigs and your ricks,<br />My hands of the
matter I&rsquo;ve rinsed.&rdquo;<br />So they take up their hats and
their sticks, .<br />And <i>exeunt ambo</i>, convinced.</p>

<h2>The Ghost, The Gallant, The Gael, And The Goblin</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>O&rsquo;er unreclaimed suburban clays<br />Some years ago were hobblin&rsquo;<br />An
elderly ghost of easy ways,<br />And an influential goblin.<br />The
ghost was a sombre spectral shape,<br />A fine old five-act fogy,<br />The
goblin imp, a lithe young ape,<br />A fine low-comedy bogy.</p>
<p>And as they exercised their joints,<br />Promoting quick digestion,<br />They
talked on several curious points,<br />And raised this delicate question:<br />&ldquo;Which
of us two is Number One&mdash;<br />The ghostie, or the goblin?&rdquo;<br />And
o&rsquo;er the point they raised in fun<br />They fairly fell a-squabblin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d barely speak, and each, in fine,<br />Grew more and
more reflective:<br />Each thought his own particular line<br />By chalks
the more effective.<br />At length they settled some one should<br />By
each of them be haunted,<br />And so arrange that either could<br />Exert
his prowess vaunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Quaint against the Statuesque&rdquo;&mdash;<br />By competition
lawful&mdash;<br />The goblin backed the Quaint Grotesque,<br />The
ghost the Grandly Awful.<br />&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the goblin, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
my plan&mdash;<br />In attitude commanding,<br />I see a stalwart Englishman<br />By
yonder tailor&rsquo;s standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very fittest man on earth<br />My influence to try on&mdash;<br />Of
gentle, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps of noble birth,<br />And dauntless as a
lion!<br />Now wrap yourself within your shroud&mdash;<br />Remain in
easy hearing&mdash;<br />Observe&mdash;you&rsquo;ll hear him scream
aloud<br />When I begin appearing!</p>
<p>The imp with yell unearthly&mdash;wild&mdash;<br />Threw off his
dark enclosure:<br />His dauntless victim looked and smiled<br />With
singular composure.<br />For hours he tried to daunt the youth,<br />For
days, indeed, but vainly&mdash;<br />The stripling smiled!&mdash;to
tell the truth,<br />The stripling smiled inanely.</p>
<p>For weeks the goblin weird and wild,<br />That noble stripling haunted;<br />For
weeks the stripling stood and smiled,<br />Unmoved and all undaunted.<br />The
sombre ghost exclaimed, &ldquo;Your plan<br />Has failed you, goblin,
plainly:<br />Now watch yon hardy Hieland man,<br />So stalwart and
ungainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the men who chase the roe,<br />Whose footsteps
never falter,<br />Who bring with them, where&rsquo;er they go,<br />A
smack of old SIR WALTER.<br />Of such as he, the men sublime<br />Who
lead their troops victorious,<br />Whose deeds go down to after-time,<br />Enshrined
in annals glorious!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of such as he the bard has said<br />&lsquo;Hech thrawfu&rsquo;
raltie rorkie!<br />Wi&rsquo; thecht ta&rsquo; croonie clapperhead<br />And
fash&rsquo; wi&rsquo; unco pawkie!&rsquo;<br />He&rsquo;ll faint away
when I appear,<br />Upon his native heather;<br />Or p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
he&rsquo;ll only scream with fear,<br />Or p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps the two
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spectre showed himself, alone,<br />To do his ghostly battling,<br />With
curdling groan and dismal moan,<br />And lots of chains a-rattling!<br />But
no&mdash;the chiel&rsquo;s stout Gaelic stuff<br />Withstood all ghostly
harrying;<br />His fingers closed upon the snuff<br />Which upwards
he was carrying.</p>
<p>For days that ghost declined to stir,<br />A foggy shapeless giant&mdash;<br />For
weeks that splendid officer<br />Stared back again defiant.<br />Just
as the Englishman returned<br />The goblin&rsquo;s vulgar staring,<br />Just
so the Scotchman boldly spurned<br />The ghost&rsquo;s unmannered scaring.</p>
<p>For several years the ghostly twain<br />These Britons bold have
haunted,<br />But all their efforts are in vain&mdash;<br />Their victims
stand undaunted.<br />This very day the imp, and ghost,<br />Whose powers
the imp derided,<br />Stand each at his allotted post&mdash;<br />The
bet is undecided.</p>

<h2>The Phantom Curate.&nbsp; A Fable</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A BISHOP once&mdash;I will not name his see&mdash;<br />Annoyed his
clergy in the mode conventional;<br />From pulpit shackles never set
them free,<br />And found a sin where sin was unintentional.<br />All
pleasures ended in abuse auricular&mdash;<br />The Bishop was so terribly
particular.</p>
<p>Though, on the whole, a wise and upright man,<br />He sought to make
of human pleasures clearances;<br />And form his priests on that much-lauded
plan<br />Which pays undue attention to appearances.<br />He couldn&rsquo;t
do good deeds without a psalm in &rsquo;em,<br />Although, in truth,
he bore away the palm in &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>Enraged to find a deacon at a dance,<br />Or catch a curate at some
mild frivolity,<br />He sought by open censure to enhance<br />Their
dread of joining harmless social jollity.<br />Yet he enjoyed (a fact
of notoriety)<br />The ordinary pleasures of society.</p>
<p>One evening, sitting at a pantomime<br />(Forbidden treat to those
who stood in fear of him),<br />Roaring at jokes, <i>sans</i> metre,
sense, or rhyme,<br />He turned, and saw immediately in rear of him,<br />His
peace of mind upsetting, and annoying it,<br />A curate, also heartily
enjoying it.</p>
<p>Again, &rsquo;t was Christmas Eve, and to enhance<br />His children&rsquo;s
pleasure in their harmless rollicking,<br />He, like a good old fellow,
stood to dance;<br />When something checked the current of his frolicking:<br />That
curate, with a maid he treated lover-ly,<br />Stood up and figured with
him in the &ldquo;Coverley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, yielding to an universal choice<br />(The company&rsquo;s demand
was an emphatic one,<br />For the old Bishop had a glorious voice),<br />In
a quartet he joined&mdash;an operatic one.<br />Harmless enough, though
ne&rsquo;er a word of grace in it,<br />When, lo! that curate came and
took the bass in it!</p>
<p>One day, when passing through a quiet street,<br />He stopped awhile
and joined a Punch&rsquo;s gathering;<br />And chuckled more than solemn
folk think meet,<br />To see that gentleman his Judy lathering;<br />And
heard, as Punch was being treated penalty,<br />That phantom curate
laughing all hyaenally.</p>
<p>Now at a picnic, &rsquo;mid fair golden curls,<br />Bright eyes,
straw hats, <i>bottines</i> that fit amazingly,<br />A croqu&ecirc;t-bout
is planned by all the girls;<br />And he, consenting, speaks of croqu&ecirc;t
praisingly;<br />But suddenly declines to play at all in it&mdash;<br />The
curate fiend has come to take a ball in it!</p>
<p>Next, when at quiet sea-side village, freed<br />From cares episcopal
and ties monarchical,<br />He grows his beard, and smokes his fragrant
weed,<br />In manner anything but hierarchical&mdash;<br />He sees&mdash;and
fixes an unearthly stare on it&mdash;<br />That curate&rsquo;s face,
with half a yard of hair on it!</p>
<p>At length he gave a charge, and spake this word:<br />&ldquo;Vicars,
your curates to enjoyment urge ye may;<br />To check their harmless
pleasuring&rsquo;s absurd;<br />What laymen do without reproach, my
clergy may.&rdquo;<br />He spake, and lo! at this concluding word of
him,<br />The curate vanished&mdash;no one since has heard of him.</p>

<h2>The Sensation Captain</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>No nobler captain ever trod<br />Than CAPTAIN PARKLEBURY TODD,<br />So
good&mdash;so wise&mdash;so brave, he!<br />But still, as all his friends
would own,<br />He had one folly&mdash;one alone&mdash;<br />This Captain
in the Navy.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever knew<br />A man so wholly given to<br />Creating
a sensation,<br />Or p&rsquo;raps I should in justice say&mdash;<br />To
what in an Adelphi play<br />Is known as &ldquo;situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed his time designing traps<br />To flurry unsuspicious chaps&mdash;<br />The
taste was his innately;<br />He couldn&rsquo;t walk into a room<br />Without
ejaculating &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;<br />Which startled ladies greatly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d wear a mask and muffling cloak,<br />Not, you will understand,
in joke,<br />As some assume disguises;<br />He did it, actuated by<br />A
simple love of mystery<br />And fondness for surprises.</p>
<p>I need not say he loved a maid&mdash;<br />His eloquence threw into
shade<br />All others who adored her.<br />The maid, though pleased
at first, I know,<br />Found, after several years or so,<br />Her startling
lover bored her.</p>
<p>So, when his orders came to sail,<br />She did not faint or scream
or wail,<br />Or with her tears anoint him:<br />She shook his hand,
and said &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo;<br />With laughter dancing in her eye&mdash;<br />Which
seemed to disappoint him.</p>
<p>But ere he went aboard his boat,<br />He placed around her little
throat<br />A ribbon, blue and yellow,<br />On which he hung a double-tooth&mdash;<br />A
simple token this, in sooth&mdash;<br />&rsquo;Twas all he had, poor
fellow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often wonder,&rdquo; he would say,<br />When very, very
far away,<br />&ldquo;If ANGELINA wears it?<br />A plan has entered
in my head:<br />I will pretend that I am dead,<br />And see how ANGY
bears it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news he made a messmate tell.<br />His ANGELINA bore it well,<br />No
sign gave she of crazing;<br />But, steady as the Inchcape Rock,<br />His
ANGELINA stood the shock<br />With fortitude amazing.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;Some one I must elect<br />Poor ANGELINA to protect<br />From
all who wish to harm her.<br />Since worthy CAPTAIN TODD is dead,<br />I
rather feel inclined to wed<br />A comfortable farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A comfortable farmer came<br />(BASSANIO TYLER was his name),<br />Who
had no end of treasure.<br />He said, &ldquo;My noble gal, be mine!&rdquo;<br />The
noble gal did not decline,<br />But simply said, &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this was told to CAPTAIN TODD,<br />At first he thought it rather
odd,<br />And felt some perturbation;<br />But very long he did not
grieve,<br />He thought he could a way perceive<br />To <i>such</i>
a situation!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not reveal myself,&rdquo; said he,<br />&ldquo;Till
they are both in the Ecclesiastical arena;<br />Then suddenly I will
appear,<br />And paralysing them with fear,<br />Demand my ANGELINA!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length arrived the wedding day;<br />Accoutred in the usual way<br />Appeared
the bridal body;<br />The worthy clergyman began,<br />When in the gallant
Captain ran<br />And cried, &ldquo;Behold your TODDY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridegroom, p&rsquo;raps, was terrified,<br />And also possibly
the bride&mdash;<br />The bridesmaids <i>were</i> affrighted;<br />But
ANGELINA, noble soul,<br />Contrived her feelings to control,<br />And
really seemed delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bride!&rdquo; said gallant CAPTAIN TODD,<br />&ldquo;She&rsquo;s
mine, uninteresting clod!<br />My own, my darling charmer!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh
dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just too late&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;m
married to, I beg to state,<br />This comfortable farmer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; the farmer said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s mine:<br />You&rsquo;ve
been and cut it far too fine!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said
TODD, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beaten.&rdquo;<br />And so he went to sea once
more,<br />&ldquo;Sensation&rdquo; he for aye forswore,<br />And married
on her native shore<br />A lady whom he&rsquo;d met before&mdash;<br />A
lovely Otaheitan.</p>

<p>One from COGSON, WILES, and RAILER,<br />My attorneys, off the Strand;<br />One

<h2>At A Pantomime.&nbsp; By A Bilious One</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>An Actor sits in doubtful gloom,<br />His stock-in-trade unfurled,<br />In
a damp funereal dressing-room<br />In the Theatre Royal, World.</p>
<p>He comes to town at Christmas-time,<br />And braves its icy breath,<br />To
play in that favourite pantomime,<br /><i>Harlequin Life and Death.</i></p>
<p>A hoary flowing wig his weird<br />Unearthly cranium caps,<br />He
hangs a long benevolent beard<br />On a pair of empty chaps.</p>
<p>To smooth his ghastly features down<br />The actor&rsquo;s art he
cribs,&mdash;<br />A long and a flowing padded gown.<br />Bedecks his
rattling ribs.</p>
<p>He cries, &ldquo;Go on&mdash;begin, begin!<br />Turn on the light
of lime&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;m dressed for jolly Old Christmas, in<br />A
favourite pantomime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain&rsquo;s up&mdash;the stage all black&mdash;<br />Time
and the year nigh sped&mdash;<br />Time as an advertising quack&mdash;<br />The
Old Year nearly dead.</p>
<p>The wand of Time is waved, and lo!<br />Revealed Old Christmas stands,<br />And
little children chuckle and crow,<br />And laugh and clap their hands.</p>
<p>The cruel old scoundrel brightens up<br />At the death of the Olden
Year,<br />And he waves a gorgeous golden cup,<br />And bids the world
good cheer.</p>
<p>The little ones hail the festive King,&mdash;<br />No thought can
make them sad.<br />Their laughter comes with a sounding ring,<br />They
clap and crow like mad!</p>
<p>They only see in the humbug old<br />A holiday every year,<br />And
handsome gifts, and joys untold,<br />And unaccustomed cheer.</p>
<p>The old ones, palsied, blear, and hoar,<br />Their breasts in anguish
beat&mdash;<br />They&rsquo;ve seen him seventy times before,<br />How
well they know the cheat!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen that ghastly pantomime,<br />They&rsquo;ve felt
its blighting breath,<br />They know that rollicking Christmas-time<br />Meant
Cold and Want and Death,&mdash;</p>
<p>Starvation&mdash;Poor Law Union fare&mdash;<br />And deadly cramps
and chills,<br />And illness&mdash;illness everywhere,<br />And crime,
and Christmas bills.</p>
<p>They know Old Christmas well, I ween,<br />Those men of ripened age;<br />They&rsquo;ve
often, often, often seen<br />That Actor off the stage!</p>
<p>They see in his gay rotundity<br />A clumsy stuffed-out dress&mdash;<br />They
see in the cup he waves on high<br />A tinselled emptiness.</p>
<p>Those aged men so lean and wan,<br />They&rsquo;ve seen it all before,<br />They
know they&rsquo;ll see the charlatan<br />But twice or three times more.</p>
<p>And so they bear with dance and song,<br />And crimson foil and green,<br />They
wearily sit, and grimly long<br />For the Transformation Scene.</p>

<h2>King Borria Bungalee Boo</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>KING BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO<br />Was a man-eating African swell;<br />His
sigh was a hullaballoo,<br />His whisper a horrible yell&mdash;<br />A
horrible, horrible yell!</p>
<p>Four subjects, and all of them male,<br />To BORRIA doubled the knee,<br />They
were once on a far larger scale,<br />But he&rsquo;d eaten the balance,
you see<br />(&ldquo;Scale&rdquo; and &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is punning,
you see).</p>
<p>There was haughty PISH-TUSH-POOH-BAH,<br />There was lumbering DOODLE-DUM-DEY,<br />Despairing
ALACK-A-DEY-AH,<br />And good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH&mdash;<br />Exemplary
TOOTLE-TUM-TEH.</p>
<p>One day there was grief in the crew,<br />For they hadn&rsquo;t a
morsel of meat,<br />And BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO<br />Was dying for something
to eat&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Come, provide me with something to eat!</p>
<p>&ldquo;ALACK-A-DEY, famished I feel;<br />Oh, good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH,<br />Where
on earth shall I look for a meal?<br />For I haven&rsquo;t no dinner
to-day!&mdash;<br />Not a morsel of dinner to-day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear TOOTLE-TUM, what shall we do?<br />Come, get us a meal,
or, in truth,<br />If you don&rsquo;t, we shall have to eat you,<br />Oh,
adorable friend of our youth!<br />Thou beloved little friend of our
youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answered, &ldquo;Oh, BUNGALEE BOO,<br />For a moment I hope
you will wait,&mdash;<br />TIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOO<br />Is the
Queen of a neighbouring state&mdash;<br />A remarkably neighbouring
state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOO,<br />She would pickle deliciously
cold&mdash;<br />And her four pretty Amazons, too,<br />Are enticing,
and not very old&mdash;<br />Twenty-seven is not very old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH,<br />There is rollicking
TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH,<br />There is jocular WAGGETY-WEH,<br />There is musical
DOH-REH-MI-FAH&mdash;<br />There&rsquo;s the nightingale DOH-REH-MI-FAH!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the forces of BUNGALEE BOO<br />Marched forth in a terrible row,<br />And
the ladies who fought for QUEEN LOO<br />Prepared to encounter the foe&mdash;<br />This
dreadful, insatiate foe!</p>
<p>But they sharpened no weapons at all,<br />And they poisoned no arrows&mdash;not
they!<br />They made ready to conquer or fall<br />In a totally different
way&mdash;<br />An entirely different way.</p>
<p>With a crimson and pearly-white dye<br />They endeavoured to make
themselves fair,<br />With black they encircled each eye,<br />And with
yellow they painted their hair<br />(It was wool, but they thought it
was hair).</p>
<p>And the forces they met in the field:-<br />And the men of KING BORRIA
said,<br />&ldquo;Amazonians, immediately yield!&rdquo;<br />And their
arrows they drew to the head&mdash;<br />Yes, drew them right up to
the head.</p>
<p>But jocular WAGGETY-WEH<br />Ogled DOODLE-DUM-DEY (which was wrong),<br />And
neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH<br />Said, &ldquo;TOOTLE-TUM, you go along!<br />You
naughty old dear, go along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And rollicking TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH<br />Tapped ALACK-A-DEY-AH with her
fan;<br />And musical DOH-REH-MI-FAH<br />Said, &ldquo;PISH, go away,
you bad man!<br />Go away, you delightful young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Amazons simpered and sighed,<br />And they ogled, and giggled,
and flushed,<br />And they opened their pretty eyes wide,<br />And they
chuckled, and flirted, and blushed<br />(At least, if they could, they&rsquo;d
have blushed).</p>
<p>But haughty PISH-TUSH-POOH-BAH<br />Said, &ldquo;ALACK-A-DEY, what
does this mean?&rdquo;<br />And despairing ALACK-A-DEY-AH<br />Said,
&ldquo;They think us uncommonly green!<br />Ha! ha! most uncommonly
green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even blundering DOODLE-DUM-DEY<br />Was insensible quite to their
leers,<br />And said good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH,<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
your blood we desire, pretty dears&mdash;<br />We have come for our
dinners, my dears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Queen of the Amazons fell<br />To BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO,&mdash;<br />In
a mouthful he gulped, with a yell,<br />TIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOO&mdash;<br />The
pretty QUEEN TOL-THE-ROL-LOO.</p>
<p>And neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH<br />Was eaten by PISH-POOH-BAH,<br />And
light-hearted WAGGETY-WEH<br />By dismal ALACK-A-DEY-AH&mdash;<br />Despairing
ALACK-A-DEY-AH.</p>
<p>And rollicking TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH<br />Was eaten by DOODLE-DUM-DEY,<br />And
musical DOH-REH-MI-FAH<br />By good little TOOTLE-DUM-TEH&mdash;<br />Exemplary
TOOTLE-TUM-TEH!</p>

<h2>The Periwinkle Girl</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that headstrong youths<br />Of decent education,<br />Determine
all-important truths,<br />With strange precipitation.</p>
<p>The ever-ready victims they,<br />Of logical illusions,<br />And
in a self-assertive way<br />They jump at strange conclusions.</p>
<p>Now take my case: Ere sorrow could<br />My ample forehead wrinkle,<br />I
had determined that I should<br />Not care to be a winkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A winkle,&rdquo; I would oft advance<br />With readiness provoking,<br />&ldquo;Can
seldom flirt, and never dance,<br />Or soothe his mind by smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, I spurned the shelly joy,<br />And spoke with strange decision&mdash;<br />Men
pointed to me as a boy<br />Who held them in derision.</p>
<p>But I was young&mdash;too young, by far&mdash;<br />Or I had been
more wary,<br />I knew not then that winkles are<br />The stock-in-trade
of MARY.</p>
<p>I had not watched her sunlight blithe<br />As o&rsquo;er their shells
it dances&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ve seen those winkles almost writhe<br />Beneath
her beaming glances.</p>
<p>Of slighting all the winkly brood<br />I surely had been chary,<br />If
I had known they formed the food<br />And stock-in-trade of MARY.</p>
<p>Both high and low and great and small<br />Fell prostrate at her
tootsies,<br />They all were noblemen, and all<br />Had balances at
COUTTS&rsquo;S.</p>
<p>Dukes with the lovely maiden dealt,<br />DUKE BAILEY and DUKE HUMPHY,<br />Who
ate her winkles till they felt<br />Exceedingly uncomfy.</p>
<p>DUKE BAILEY greatest wealth computes,<br />And sticks, they say,
at no-thing,<br />He wears a pair of golden boots<br />And silver underclothing.</p>
<p>DUKE HUMPHY, as I understand,<br />Though mentally acuter,<br />His
boots are only silver, and<br />His underclothing pewter.</p>
<p>A third adorer had the girl,<br />A man of lowly station&mdash;<br />A
miserable grov&rsquo;ling Earl<br />Besought her approbation.</p>
<p>This humble cad she did refuse<br />With much contempt and loathing,<br />He
wore a pair of leather shoes<br />And cambric underclothing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word!<br />Well,
really&mdash;come, I never!<br />Oh, go along, it&rsquo;s too absurd!<br />My
goodness!&nbsp; Did you ever?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two Dukes would Mary make a bride,<br />And from her foes
defend her&rdquo;&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Well, not exactly that,&rdquo;
they cried,<br />&ldquo;We offer guilty splendour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not offer marriage rite,<br />So please dismiss the
notion!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that alters
quite<br />The state of my emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl he up and says, says he,<br />&ldquo;Dismiss them to their
orgies,<br />For I am game to marry thee<br />Quite reg&rsquo;lar at
St. George&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(He&rsquo;d had, it happily befell,<br />A decent education,<br />His
views would have befitted well<br />A far superior station.)</p>
<p>His sterling worth had worked a cure,<br />She never heard him grumble;<br />She
saw his soul was good and pure,<br />Although his rank was humble.</p>
<p>Her views of earldoms and their lot,<br />All underwent expansion&mdash;<br />Come,
Virtue in an earldom&rsquo;s cot!<br />Go, Vice in ducal mansion!</p>

<h2>Thomson Green And Harriet Hale</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(To be sung to the Air of &ldquo;An &rsquo;Orrible Tale.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Oh list to this incredible tale<br />Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET
HALE;<br />Its truth in one remark you&rsquo;ll sum&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Twaddle
twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, THOMSON GREEN was an auctioneer,<br />And made three hundred
pounds a year;<br />And HARRIET HALE, most strange to say,<br />Gave
pianoforte lessons at a sovereign a day.</p>
<p>Oh, THOMSON GREEN, I may remark,<br />Met HARRIET HALE in Regent&rsquo;s
Park,<br />Where he, in a casual kind of way,<br />Spoke of the extraordinary
beauty of the day.</p>
<p>They met again, and strange, though true,<br />He courted her for
a month or two,<br />Then to her pa he said, says he,<br />&ldquo;Old
man, I love your daughter and your daughter worships me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their names were regularly banned,<br />The wedding day was settled,
and<br />I&rsquo;ve ascertained by dint of search<br />They were married
on the quiet at St. Mary Abbot&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>Oh, list to this incredible tale<br />Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET
HALE,<br />Its truth in one remark you&rsquo;ll sum&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Twaddle
twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very self-same afternoon<br />They started on their honeymoon,<br />And
(oh, astonishment!) took flight<br />To a pretty little cottage close
to Shanklin, Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>But now&mdash;you&rsquo;ll doubt my word, I know&mdash;<br />In a
month they both returned, and lo!<br />Astounding fact! this happy pair<br />Took
a gentlemanly residence in Canonbury Square!</p>
<p>They led a weird and reckless life,<br />They dined each day, this
man and wife<br />(Pray disbelieve it, if you please),<br />On a joint
of meat, a pudding, and a little bit of cheese.</p>
<p>In time came those maternal joys<br />Which take the form of girls
or boys,<br />And strange to say of each they&rsquo;d one&mdash;<br />A
tiddy-iddy daughter, and a tiddy-iddy son!</p>
<p>Oh, list to this incredible tale<br />Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET
HALE,<br />Its truth in one remark you&rsquo;ll sum&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Twaddle
twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twaddle twum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My name for truth is gone, I fear,<br />But, monstrous as it may
appear,<br />They let their drawing-room one day<br />To an eligible
person in the cotton-broking way.</p>
<p>Whenever THOMSON GREEN fell sick<br />His wife called in a doctor,
quick,<br />From whom some words like these would come&mdash;<br /><i>Fiat
mist. sumendum haustus</i>, in a <i>cochleyareum.</i></p>
<p>For thirty years this curious pair<br />Hung out in Canonbury Square,<br />And
somehow, wonderful to say,<br />They loved each other dearly in a quiet
sort of way.</p>
<p>Well, THOMSON GREEN fell ill and died;<br />For just a year his widow
cried,<br />And then her heart she gave away<br />To the eligible lodger
in the cotton-broking way.</p>
<p>Oh, list to this incredible tale<br />Of THOMSON GREEN and HARRIET

<h2>Bob Polter</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>BOB POLTER was a navvy, and<br />His hands were coarse, and dirty
too,<br />His homely face was rough and tanned,<br />His time of life
was thirty-two.</p>
<p>He lived among a working clan<br />(A wife he hadn&rsquo;t got at
all),<br />A decent, steady, sober man&mdash;<br />No saint, however&mdash;not
at all.</p>
<p>He smoked, but in a modest way,<br />Because he thought he needed
it;<br />He drank a pot of beer a day,<br />And sometimes he exceeded
it.</p>
<p>At times he&rsquo;d pass with other men<br />A loud convivial night
or two,<br />With, very likely, now and then,<br />On Saturdays, a fight
or two.</p>
<p>But still he was a sober soul,<br />A labour-never-shirking man,<br />Who
paid his way&mdash;upon the whole<br />A decent English working man.</p>
<p>One day, when at the Nelson&rsquo;s Head<br />(For which he may be
blamed of you),<br />A holy man appeared, and said,<br />&ldquo;Oh,
ROBERT, I&rsquo;m ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on ROBERT&rsquo;S beer<br />Before he could drink
up any,<br />And on the floor, with sigh and tear,<br />He poured the
pot of &ldquo;thruppenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ROBERT, at this very bar<br />A truth you&rsquo;ll be
discovering,<br />A good and evil genius are<br />Around your noddle
hovering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both are here to bid you shun<br />The other one&rsquo;s
society,<br />For Total Abstinence is one,<br />The other, Inebriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his hand&mdash;a vapour came&mdash;<br />A wizard POLTER
reckoned him;<br />A bogy rose and called his name,<br />And with his
finger beckoned him.</p>
<p>The monster&rsquo;s salient points to sum,&mdash;<br />His heavy
breath was portery:<br />His glowing nose suggested rum:<br />His eyes
were gin-and-<i>wor</i>tery.</p>
<p>His dress was torn&mdash;for dregs of ale<br />And slops of gin had
rusted it;<br />His pimpled face was wan and pale,<br />Where filth
had not encrusted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, POLTER,&rdquo; said the fiend, &ldquo;begin,<br />And
keep the bowl a-flowing on&mdash;<br />A working man needs pints of
gin<br />To keep his clockwork going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BOB shuddered: &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve made a miss<br />If you take
me for one of you:<br />You filthy beast, get out of this&mdash;<br />BOB
POLTER don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t none of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon gave a drunken shriek,<br />And crept away in stealthiness,<br />And
lo! instead, a person sleek,<br />Who seemed to burst with healthiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In me, as your adviser hints,<br />Of Abstinence you&rsquo;ve
got a type&mdash;<br />Of MR. TWEEDIE&rsquo;S pretty prints<br />I am
the happy prototype.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you abjure the social toast,<br />And pipes, and such frivolities,<br />You
possibly some day may boast<br />My prepossessing qualities!&rdquo;</p>
<p>BOB rubbed his eyes, and made &rsquo;em blink:<br />&ldquo;You almost
make me tremble, you!<br />If I abjure fermented drink,<br />Shall I,
indeed, resemble you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will my whiskers curl so tight?<br />My cheeks grow smug
and muttony?<br />My face become so red and white?<br />My coat so blue
and buttony?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will trousers, such as yours, array<br />Extremities inferior?<br />Will
chubbiness assert its sway<br />All over my exterior?</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this, my unenlightened state,<br />To work in heavy boots
I comes;<br />Will pumps henceforward decorate<br />My tiddle toddle
tootsicums?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I get so plump and fresh,<br />And look no longer
seedily?<br />My skin will henceforth fit my flesh<br />So tightly and
so TWEEDIE-ly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phantom said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have all this,<br />You&rsquo;ll
know no kind of huffiness,<br />Your life will be one chubby bliss,<br />One
long unruffled puffiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off!&rdquo; said irritated BOB.<br />&ldquo;Why come you
here to bother one?<br />You pharisaical old snob,<br />You&rsquo;re
wuss almost than t&rsquo;other one!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I takes my pipe&mdash;I takes my pot,<br />And drunk I&rsquo;m

<h2>The Story Of Prince Agib</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Strike the concertina&rsquo;s melancholy string!<br />Blow the spirit-stirring
harp like anything!<br />Let the piano&rsquo;s martial blast<br />Rouse
the Echoes of the Past,<br />For of AGIB, PRINCE OF TARTARY, I sing!</p>
<p>Of AGIB, who, amid Tartaric scenes,<br />Wrote a lot of ballet music
in his teens:<br />His gentle spirit rolls<br />In the melody of souls&mdash;<br />Which
is pretty, but I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>Of AGIB, who could readily, at sight,<br />Strum a march upon the
loud Theodolite.<br />He would diligently play<br />On the Zoetrope
all day,<br />And blow the gay Pantechnicon all night.</p>
<p>One winter&mdash;I am shaky in my dates&mdash;<br />Came two starving
Tartar minstrels to his gates;<br />Oh, ALLAH be obeyed,<br />How infernally
they played!<br />I remember that they called themselves the &ldquo;O&uuml;aits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! that day of sorrow, misery, and rage,<br />I shall carry to the
Catacombs of Age,<br />Photographically lined<br />On the tablet of
my mind,<br />When a yesterday has faded from its page!</p>
<p>Alas! PRINCE AGIB went and asked them in;<br />Gave them beer, and
eggs, and sweets, and scent, and tin.<br />And when (as snobs would
say)<br />They had &ldquo;put it all away,&rdquo;<br />He requested
them to tune up and begin.</p>
<p>Though its icy horror chill you to the core,<br />I will tell you
what I never told before,&mdash;<br />The consequences true<br />Of
that awful interview,<br /><i>For I listened at the keyhole in the door</i>!</p>
<p>They played him a sonata&mdash;let me see!<br />&ldquo;<i>Medulla
oblongata</i>&rdquo;&mdash;key of G.<br />Then they began to sing<br />That
extremely lovely thing,<br /><i>Scherzando! ma non troppo</i>, <i>ppp</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave them money, more than they could count,<br />Scent from a
most ingenious little fount,<br />More beer, in little kegs,<br />Many
dozen hard-boiled eggs,<br />And goodies to a fabulous amount.</p>
<p>Now follows the dim horror of my tale,<br />And I feel I&rsquo;m
growing gradually pale,<br />For, even at this day,<br />Though its
sting has passed away,<br />When I venture to remember it, I quail!</p>
<p>The elder of the brothers gave a squeal,<br />All-overish it made
me for to feel;<br />&ldquo;Oh, PRINCE,&rdquo; he says, says he,<br />&ldquo;<i>If
a Prince indeed you be</i>,<br />I&rsquo;ve a mystery I&rsquo;m going
to reveal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen, if you&rsquo;d shun a horrid death,<br />To what
the gent who&rsquo;s speaking to you saith:<br />No &lsquo;O&uuml;aits&rsquo;
in truth are we,<br />As you fancy that we be,<br />For (ter-remble!)
I am ALECK&mdash;this is BETH!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said AGIB, &ldquo;Oh! accursed of your kind,<br />I have heard that
ye are men of evil mind!&rdquo;<br />BETH gave a dreadful shriek&mdash;<br />But
before he&rsquo;d time to speak<br />I was mercilessly collared from
behind.</p>
<p>In number ten or twelve, or even more,<br />They fastened me full
length upon the floor.<br />On my face extended flat,<br />I was walloped
with a cat<br />For listening at the keyhole of a door.</p>
<p>Oh! the horror of that agonizing thrill!<br />(I can feel the place
in frosty weather still).<br />For a week from ten to four<br />I was
fastened to the floor,<br />While a mercenary wopped me with a will</p>
<p>They branded me and broke me on a wheel,<br />And they left me in
an hospital to heal;<br />And, upon my solemn word,<br />I have never
never heard<br />What those Tartars had determined to reveal.</p>
<p>But that day of sorrow, misery, and rage,<br />I shall carry to the
Catacombs of Age,<br />Photographically lined<br />On the tablet of
my mind,<br />When a yesterday has faded from its page</p>

<h2>Ellen McJones Aberdeen</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>MACPHAIRSON CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS McCLAN<br />Was the son of an elderly
labouring man;<br />You&rsquo;ve guessed him a Scotchman, shrewd reader,
at sight,<br />And p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps altogether, shrewd reader, you&rsquo;re
right.</p>
<p>From the bonnie blue Forth to the lovely Deeside,<br />Round by Dingwall
and Wrath to the mouth of the Clyde,<br />There wasn&rsquo;t a child
or a woman or man<br />Who could pipe with CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS McCLAN.</p>
<p>No other could wake such detestable groans,<br />With reed and with
chaunter&mdash;with bag and with drones:<br />All day and ill night
he delighted the chiels<br />With sniggering pibrochs and jiggety reels.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d clamber a mountain and squat on the ground,<br />And the
neighbouring maidens would gather around<br />To list to the pipes and
to gaze in his een,<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>
<p>All loved their McCLAN, save a Sassenach brute,<br />Who came to
the Highlands to fish and to shoot;<br />He dressed himself up in a
Highlander way,<br />Tho&rsquo; his name it was PATTISON CORBY TORBAY.</p>
<p>TORBAY had incurred a good deal of expense<br />To make him a Scotchman
in every sense;<br />But this is a matter, you&rsquo;ll readily own,<br />That
isn&rsquo;t a question of tailors alone.</p>
<p>A Sassenach chief may be bonily built,<br />He may purchase a sporran,
a bonnet, and kilt;<br />Stick a ske&auml;n in his hose&mdash;wear an
acre of stripes&mdash;<br />But he cannot assume an affection for pipes.</p>
<p>CLONGLOCKETY&rsquo;S pipings all night and all day<br />Quite frenzied
poor PATTISON CORBY TORBAY;<br />The girls were amused at his singular
spleen,<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN,</p>
<p>&ldquo;MACPHAIRSON CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS, my lad,<br />With pibrochs
and reels you are driving me mad.<br />If you really must play on that
cursed affair,<br />My goodness! play something resembling an air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boiled over the blood of MACPHAIRSON McCLAN&mdash;<br />The Clan
of Clonglocketty rose as one man;<br />For all were enraged at the insult,
I ween&mdash;<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s show,&rdquo; said McCLAN, &ldquo;to this Sassenach
loon<br />That the bagpipes <i>can</i> play him a regular tune.<br />Let&rsquo;s
see,&rdquo; said McCLAN, as he thoughtfully sat,<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;<i>In
my Cottage</i>&rsquo; is easy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll practise at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blew at his &ldquo;Cottage,&rdquo; and blew with a will,<br />For
a year, seven months, and a fortnight, until<br />(You&rsquo;ll hardly
believe it) McCLAN, I declare,<br />Elicited something resembling an
air.</p>
<p>It was wild&mdash;it was fitful&mdash;as wild as the breeze&mdash;<br />It
wandered about into several keys;<br />It was jerky, spasmodic, and
harsh, I&rsquo;m aware;<br />But still it distinctly suggested an air.</p>
<p>The Sassenach screamed, and the Sassenach danced;<br />He shrieked
in his agony&mdash;bellowed and pranced;<br />And the maidens who gathered
rejoiced at the scene&mdash;<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hech gather, hech gather, hech gather around;<br />And fill
a&rsquo; ye lugs wi&rsquo; the exquisite sound.<br />An air fra&rsquo;
the bagpipes&mdash;beat that if ye can!<br />Hurrah for CLONGLOCKETTY
ANGUS McCLAN!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fame of his piping spread over the land:<br />Respectable widows
proposed for his hand,<br />And maidens came flocking to sit on the
green&mdash;<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>
<p>One morning the fidgety Sassenach swore<br />He&rsquo;d stand it
no longer&mdash;he drew his claymore,<br />And (this was, I think, in
extremely bad taste)<br />Divided CLONGLOCKETTY close to the waist.</p>
<p>Oh! loud were the wailings for ANGUS McCLAN,<br />Oh! deep was the
grief for that excellent man;<br />The maids stood aghast at the horrible
scene&mdash;<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>
<p>It sorrowed poor PATTISON CORBY TORBAY<br />To find them &ldquo;take
on&rdquo; in this serious way;<br />He pitied the poor little fluttering
birds,<br />And solaced their souls with the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, maidens,&rdquo; said PATTISON, touching his hat,<br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
blubber, my dears, for a fellow like that;<br />Observe, I&rsquo;m a
very superior man,<br />A much better fellow than ANGUS McCLAN.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smiled when he winked and addressed them as &ldquo;dears,&rdquo;<br />And
they all of them vowed, as they dried up their tears,<br />A pleasanter
gentleman never was seen&mdash;<br />Especially ELLEN McJONES ABERDEEN.</p>

<h2>Peter The Wag</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Policeman PETER forth I drag<br />From his obscure retreat:<br />He
was a merry genial wag,<br />Who loved a mad conceit.<br />If he were
asked the time of day,<br />By country bumpkins green,<br />He not unfrequently
would say,<br />&ldquo;A quarter past thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever you by word of mouth<br />Inquired of MISTER FORTH<br />The
way to somewhere in the South,<br />He always sent you North.<br />With
little boys his beat along<br />He loved to stop and play;<br />He loved
to send old ladies wrong,<br />And teach their feet to stray.</p>
<p>He would in frolic moments, when<br />Such mischief bent upon,<br />Take
Bishops up as betting men&mdash;<br />Bid Ministers move on.<br />Then
all the worthy boys he knew<br />He regularly licked,<br />And always
collared people who<br />Had had their pockets picked.</p>
<p>He was not naturally bad,<br />Or viciously inclined,<br />But from
his early youth he had<br />A waggish turn of mind.<br />The Men of
London grimly scowled<br />With indignation wild;<br />The Men of London
gruffly growled,<br />But PETER calmly smiled.</p>
<p>Against this minion of the Crown<br />The swelling murmurs grew&mdash;<br />From
Camberwell to Kentish Town&mdash;<br />From Rotherhithe to Kew.<br />Still
humoured he his wagsome turn,<br />And fed in various ways<br />The
coward rage that dared to burn,<br />But did not dare to blaze.</p>
<p>Still, Retribution has her day,<br />Although her flight is slow:<br /><i>One
day that Crusher lost his way<br />Near Poland Street</i>, <i>Soho.<br /></i>The
haughty boy, too proud to ask,<br />To find his way resolved,<br />And
in the tangle of his task<br />Got more and more involved.</p>
<p>The Men of London, overjoyed,<br />Came there to jeer their foe,<br />And
flocking crowds completely cloyed<br />The mazes of Soho.<br />The news
on telegraphic wires<br />Sped swiftly o&rsquo;er the lea,<br />Excursion
trains from distant shires<br />Brought myriads to see.</p>
<p>For weeks he trod his self-made beats<br />Through Newport- Gerrard-
Bear-<br />Greek- Rupert- Frith- Dean- Poland- Streets,<br />And into
Golden Square.<br />But all, alas! in vain, for when<br />He tried to
learn the way<br />Of little boys or grown-up men,<br />They none of
them would say.</p>
<p>Their eyes would flash&mdash;their teeth would grind&mdash;<br />Their
lips would tightly curl&mdash;<br />They&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Thy way
thyself must find,<br />Thou misdirecting churl!&rdquo;<br />And, similarly,
also, when<br />He tried a foreign friend;<br />Italians answered, &ldquo;<i>Il
balen</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<br />The French, &ldquo;No comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Russ would say with gleaming eye<br />&ldquo; Sevastopol!&rdquo;
and groan.<br />The Greek said, &Tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega;, &tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;,<br />&Tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega;,
&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, &tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega;&nu;.&rdquo;<br />To
wander thus for many a year<br />That Crusher never ceased&mdash;<br />The
Men of London dropped a tear,<br />Their anger was appeased</p>
<p>At length exploring gangs were sent<br />To find poor FORTH&rsquo;S
remains&mdash;<br />A handsome grant by Parliament<br />Was voted for
their pains.<br />To seek the poor policeman out<br />Bold spirits volunteered,<br />And
when they swore they&rsquo;d solve the doubt,<br />The Men of London
cheered.</p>
<p>And in a yard, dark, dank, and drear,<br />They found him, on the
floor&mdash;<br />It leads from Richmond Buildings&mdash;near<br />The
Royalty stage-door.<br />With brandy cold and brandy hot<br />They plied
him, starved and wet,<br />And made him sergeant on the spot&mdash;<br />The
Men of London&rsquo;s pet!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>Ben Allah Achmet;&mdash;Or, The Fatal Tum</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I once did know a Turkish man<br />Whom I upon a two-pair-back met,<br />His
name it was EFFENDI KHAN<br />BACKSHEESH PASHA BEN ALLAH ACHMET.</p>
<p>A DOCTOR BROWN I also knew&mdash;<br />I&rsquo;ve often eaten of
his bounty;<br />The Turk and he they lived at Hooe,<br />In Sussex,
that delightful county!</p>
<p>I knew a nice young lady there,<br />Her name was EMILY MACPHERSON,<br />And
though she wore another&rsquo;s hair,<br />She was an interesting person.</p>
<p>The Turk adored the maid of Hooe<br />(Although his harem would have
shocked her).<br />But BROWN adored that maiden too:<br />He was a most
seductive doctor.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d follow her where&rsquo;er she&rsquo;d go&mdash;<br />A
course of action most improper;<br />She neither knew by sight, and
so<br />For neither of them cared a copper.</p>
<p>BROWN did not know that Turkish male,<br />He might have been his
sainted mother:<br />The people in this simple tale<br />Are total strangers
to each other.</p>
<p>One day that Turk he sickened sore,<br />And suffered agonies oppressive;<br />He
threw himself upon the floor<br />And rolled about in pain excessive.</p>
<p>It made him moan, it made him groan,<br />And almost wore him to
a mummy.<br />Why should I hesitate to own<br />That pain was in his
little tummy?</p>
<p>At length a doctor came, and rung<br />(As ALLAH ACHMET had desired),<br />Who
felt his pulse, looked up his tongue,<br />And hemmed and hawed, and
then inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the pain that long has preyed<br />Upon you in so
sad a way, sir?&rdquo;<br />The Turk he giggled, blushed, and said:<br />I
don&rsquo;t exactly like to say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, nonsense!&rdquo; said good DOCTOR BROWN.<br />&ldquo;So
this is Turkish coyness, is it?<br />You must contrive to fight it down&mdash;<br />Come,
come, sir, please to be explicit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Turk he shyly bit his thumb,<br />And coyly blushed like one
half-witted,<br />&ldquo;The pain is in my little tum,&rdquo;<br />He,
whispering, at length admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take you this, and take you that&mdash;<br />Your blood
flows sluggish in its channel&mdash;<br />You must get rid of all this
fat,<br />And wear my medicated flannel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll send for me when you&rsquo;re in need&mdash;<br />My
name is BROWN&mdash;your life I&rsquo;ve saved it.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;My
rival!&rdquo; shrieked the invalid,<br />And drew a mighty sword and
waved it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This to thy weazand, Christian pest!&rdquo;<br />Aloud the
Turk in frenzy yelled it,<br />And drove right through the doctor&rsquo;s
chest<br />The sabre and the hand that held it.</p>
<p>The blow was a decisive one,<br />And DOCTOR BROWN grew deadly pasty,<br />&ldquo;Now
see the mischief that you&rsquo;ve done&mdash;<br />You Turks are so
extremely hasty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two DOCTOR BROWNS in Hooe&mdash;<br /><i>He&rsquo;s</i>
short and stout, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> tall and wizen;<br />You&rsquo;ve
been and run the wrong one through,<br />That&rsquo;s how the error
has arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The accident was thus explained,<br />Apologies were only heard now:<br />&ldquo;At
my mistake I&rsquo;m really pained&mdash;<br />I am, indeed&mdash;upon
my word now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me, sir, you shall be interred,<br />A mausoleum grand
awaits me.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t say another word,<br />I&rsquo;m
sure that more than compensates me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, kind Turk, you&rsquo;re full inside?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
room,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for any number.&rdquo;<br />And so they
laid them down and died.<br />In proud Stamboul they sleep their slumber,</p>

<h2>The Three Kings Of Chickeraboo</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There were three niggers of Chickeraboo&mdash;<br />PACIFICO, BANG-BANG,
POPCHOP&mdash;who<br />Exclaimed, one terribly sultry day,<br />&ldquo;Oh,
let&rsquo;s be kings in a humble way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first was a highly-accomplished &ldquo;bones,&rdquo;<br />The
next elicited banjo tones,<br />The third was a quiet, retiring chap,<br />Who
danced an excellent break-down &ldquo;flap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We niggers,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;have formed a plan<br />By
which, whenever we like, we can<br />Extemporise kingdoms near the beach,<br />And
then we&rsquo;ll collar a kingdom each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three casks, from somebody else&rsquo;s stores,<br />Shall
represent our island shores,<br />Their sides the ocean wide shall lave,<br />Their
heads just topping the briny wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Britain&rsquo;s navy scours the sea,<br />And everywhere
her ships they be;<br />She&rsquo;ll recognise our rank, perhaps,<br />When
she discovers we&rsquo;re Royal Chaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If to her skirts you want to cling,<br />It&rsquo;s quite
sufficient that you&rsquo;re a king;<br />She does not push inquiry
far<br />To learn what sort of king you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ship of several thousand tons,<br />And mounting seventy-something
guns,<br />Ploughed, every year, the ocean blue,<br />Discovering kings
and countries new.</p>
<p>The brave REAR-ADMIRAL BAILEY PIP,<br />Commanding that magnificent
ship,<br />Perceived one day, his glasses through,<br />The kings that
came from Chickeraboo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear eyes!&rdquo; said ADMIRAL PIP, &ldquo;I see<br />Three
flourishing islands on our lee.<br />And, bless me! most remarkable
thing!<br />On every island stands a king!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, lower the Admiral&rsquo;s gig,&rdquo; he cried,<br />&ldquo;And
over the dancing waves I&rsquo;ll glide;<br />That low obeisance I may
do<br />To those three kings of Chickeraboo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Admiral pulled to the islands three;<br />The kings saluted him
gracious<i>lee</i>.<br />The Admiral, pleased at his welcome warm,<br />Unrolled
a printed Alliance form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, sign me this, I pray&mdash;<br />I come in a
friendly kind of way&mdash;<br />I come, if you please, with the best
intents,<br />And QUEEN VICTORIA&rsquo;S compliments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kings were pleased as they well could be;<br />The most retiring
of the three,<br />In a &ldquo;cellar-flap&rdquo; to his joy gave vent<br />With
a banjo-bones accompaniment.</p>
<p>The great REAR-ADMIRAL BAILEY PIP<br />Embarked on board his jolly
big ship,<br />Blue Peter flew from his lofty fore,<br />And off he
sailed to his native shore.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL PIP directly went<br />To the Lord at the head of the Government,<br />Who
made him, by a stroke of a quill,<br />BARON DE PIPPE, OF PIPPETONNEVILLE.</p>
<p>The College of Heralds permission yield<br />That he should quarter
upon his shield<br />Three islands, <i>vert</i>, on a field of blue,<br />With
the pregnant motto &ldquo;Chickeraboo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ambassadors, yes, and attach&eacute;s, too,<br />Are going to sail
for Chickeraboo.<br />And, see, on the good ship&rsquo;s crowded deck,<br />A
bishop, who&rsquo;s going out there on spec.</p>
<p>And let us all hope that blissful things<br />May come of alliance
with darky kings,<br />And, may we never, whatever we do,<br />Declare
a war with Chickeraboo!</p>

<h2>Joe Golightly&mdash;Or, The First Lord&rsquo;s Daughter</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A tar, but poorly prized,<br />Long, shambling, and unsightly,<br />Thrashed,
bullied, and despised,<br />Was wretched JOE GOLIGHTLY.</p>
<p>He bore a workhouse brand;<br />No Pa or Ma had claimed him,<br />The
Beadle found him, and<br />The Board of Guardians named him.</p>
<p>P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps some Princess&rsquo;s son&mdash;<br />A beggar
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps his mother.<br /><i>He</i> rather thought the one,<br />I
rather think the other.</p>
<p>He liked his ship at sea,<br />He loved the salt sea-water,<br />He
worshipped junk, and he<br />Adored the First Lord&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>The First Lord&rsquo;s daughter, proud,<br />Snubbed Earls and Viscounts
nightly;<br />She sneered at Barts. aloud,<br />And spurned poor Joe
Golightly.</p>
<p>Whene&rsquo;er he sailed afar<br />Upon a Channel cruise, he<br />Unpacked
his light guitar<br />And sang this ballad (Boosey):</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ballad</p>
<p>The moon is on the sea,<br />Willow!<br />The wind blows towards

<p>She says, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere folly quite,<br />Willow!<br />For

possibly she&rsquo;s right,<br />Willow!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>His skipper (CAPTAIN JOYCE),<br />He gave him many a rating,<br />And
almost lost his voice<br />From thus expostulating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay aft, you lubber, do!<br />What&rsquo;s come to that young
man, JOE?<br />Belay!&mdash;&rsquo;vast heaving! you!<br />Do kindly
stop that banjo!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, I do&mdash;O lor&rsquo;!&mdash;<br />You&rsquo;d shipped

forth in accents sad<br />His aggravating &ldquo;Willow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stern love of duty bad<br />Been JOYCE&rsquo;S chiefest beauty;<br />Says
he, &ldquo;I love that lad,<br />But duty, damme! duty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve months&rsquo; black-hole, I say,<br />Where daylight
never flashes;<br />And always twice a day<br />A good six dozen lashes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But JOSEPH had a mate,<br />A sailor stout and lusty,<br />A man
of low estate,<br />But singularly trusty.</p>
<p>Says he, &ldquo;Cheer hup, young JOE!<br />I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I&rsquo;m arter&mdash;<br />To that Fust Lord I&rsquo;ll go<br />And
ax him for his darter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that Fust Lord I&rsquo;ll go<br />And say you love her
dearly.&rdquo;<br />And JOE said (weeping low),<br />&ldquo;I wish you
would, sincerely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That sailor to that Lord<br />Went, soon as he had landed,<br />And
of his own accord<br />An interview demanded.</p>
<p>Says he, with seaman&rsquo;s roll,<br />&ldquo;My Captain (wot&rsquo;s
a Tartar)<br />Guv JOE twelve months&rsquo; black-hole,<br />For lovering

<p>&ldquo;He loves MISS LADY JANE<br />(I own she is his betters),<br />But

remarked his Lordship.</p>
<p>That honest tar repaired<br />To JOE upon the billow,<br />And told
him how he&rsquo;d fared.<br />JOE only whispered, &ldquo;Willow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for that dreadful crime<br />(Young sailors, learn to shun it)<br />He&rsquo;s
working out his time;<br />In six months he&rsquo;ll have done it.</p>

<h2>Gentle Alice Brown</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was a robber&rsquo;s daughter, and her name was ALICE BROWN,<br />Her
father was the terror of a small Italian town;<br />Her mother was a
foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;<br />But it isn&rsquo;t of her
parents that I&rsquo;m going for to sing.</p>
<p>As ALICE was a-sitting at her window-sill one day,<br />A beautiful
young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;<br />She cast her eyes
upon him, and he looked so good and true,<br />That she thought, &ldquo;I
could be happy with a gentleman like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,<br />She
knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten;<br />A sorter in the
Custom-house, it was his daily road<br />(The Custom-house was fifteen
minutes&rsquo; walk from her abode).</p>
<p>But ALICE was a pious girl, who knew it wasn&rsquo;t wise<br />To
look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes;<br />So she
sought the village priest to whom her family confessed,<br />The priest
by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, holy father,&rdquo; ALICE said, &ldquo;&rsquo;t would
grieve you, would it not,<br />To discover that I was a most disreputable
lot?<br />Of all unhappy sinners I&rsquo;m the most unhappy one!&rdquo;<br />The
padre said, &ldquo;Whatever have you been and gone and done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,<br />I&rsquo;ve
assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad,<br />I&rsquo;ve planned
a little burglary and forged a little cheque,<br />And slain a little
baby for the coral on its neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy pastor heaved a sigh, and dropped a silent tear,<br />And
said, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t judge yourself too heavily, my dear:<br />It&rsquo;s
wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece;<br />But sins like
these one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls will be girls&mdash;you&rsquo;re very young, and flighty
in your mind;<br />Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect
to find:<br />We mustn&rsquo;t be too hard upon these little girlish
tricks&mdash;<br />Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;five crimes at half-a-crown&mdash;exactly
twelve-and-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; little Alice cried, &ldquo;your kindness
makes me weep,<br />You do these little things for me so singularly
cheap&mdash;<br />Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;<br />But,
oh! there is another crime I haven&rsquo;t mentioned yet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes,<br />I&rsquo;ve
noticed at my window, as I&rsquo;ve sat a-catching flies;<br />He passes
by it every day as certain as can be&mdash;<br />I blush to say I&rsquo;ve
winked at him, and he has winked at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; said FATHER PAUL, &ldquo;my erring daughter!&nbsp;
On my word<br />This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.<br />Why,
naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand<br />To a promising
young robber, the lieutenant of his band!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents
so!<br />They are the most remunerative customers I know;<br />For many
many years they&rsquo;ve kept starvation from my doors:<br />I never
knew so criminal a family as yours!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The common country folk in this insipid neighbourhood<br />Have
nothing to confess, they&rsquo;re so ridiculously good;<br />And if
you marry any one respectable at all,<br />Why, you&rsquo;ll reform,
and what will then become of FATHER PAUL?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,<br />And
started off in haste to tell the news to ROBBER BROWN&mdash;<br />To
tell him how his daughter, who was now for marriage fit,<br />Had winked
upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.</p>
<p>Good ROBBER BROWN he muffled up his anger pretty well:<br />He said,
&ldquo;I have a notion, and that notion I will tell;<br />I will nab
this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,<br />And get my gentle
wife to chop him into little bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve studied human nature, and I know a thing or two:<br />Though
a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do&mdash;<br />A feeling
of disgust upon her senses there will fall<br />When she looks upon
his body chopped particularly small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;<br />He
watched his opportunity, and seized him unaware;<br />He took a life-preserver
and he hit him on the head,<br />And MRS. BROWN dissected him before
she went to bed.</p>
<p>And pretty little ALICE grew more settled in her mind,<br />She never
more was guilty of a weakness of the kind,<br />Until at length good
ROBBER BROWN bestowed her pretty hand<br />On the promising young robber,
the lieutenant of his band.</p>

******This file should be named 2babb10h.htm or 2babb10h.zip******

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
