<h1>
The First Book of Kings
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Now king David was old and
stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Therefore his servants
said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and
let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your
bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> So they sought for a beautiful
young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the
Shunammite, and brought her to the king.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> The young lady was very beautiful;
and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn't
know her intimately.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Then
Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and
he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> His father had not
displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he was
also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> He conferred with Joab the son of
Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped
him.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But Zadok the priest,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and
Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
 <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Adonijah killed sheep and
cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel;
and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah,
the king's servants:  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> but
Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his
brother, he didn't call.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba
the mother of Solomon, saying, Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of
Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it?  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Now therefore come, please let me
give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your
son Solomon.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Go and get
you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you, my lord, king, swear to
your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Behold, while you yet talk there
with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Bathsheba went in to the
king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the
Shunammite was ministering to the king.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Bathsheba bowed, and did
obeisance to the king. The king said, What would you?  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> She said to him, My lord, you
swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid, <I>saying</I>, Assuredly
Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
 <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Now, behold, Adonijah
reigns; and you, my lord the king, don't know it:  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> and he has slain cattle and
fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king,
and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't
called Solomon your servant.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> You, my lord the king, the eyes
of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the
throne of my lord the king after him.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Otherwise it will happen, when my
lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon
shall be counted offenders.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Behold, while she yet talked with
the king, Nathan the prophet came in.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> They told the king, saying,
Behold, Nathan the prophet. When he was come in before the king, he bowed
himself before the king with his face to the ground.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Nathan said, My lord, king, have
you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
 <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> For he is gone down this
day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has
called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the
priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
<I>Long</I> live king Adonijah.  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> But he hasn't called me, even me
your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
your servant Solomon.  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> Is
this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown to your
servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
 <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> Then king David answered,
Call to me Bathsheba. She came into the king's presence, and stood before
the king.  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> The king swore,
and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
 <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> most certainly as I swore
to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son
shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most
certainly so will I do this day.  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> Then Bathsheba bowed with her
face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord
king David live forever.  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> King David said, Call to me Zadok
the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. They
came before the king.  <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> The
king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause
Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
 <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> and let Zadok the priest
and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow you the
trumpet, and say, <I>Long</I> live king Solomon.  <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> Then you shall come up after him,
and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place;
and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
answered the king, and said, Amen: Yahweh, the God of my lord the king,
say so <I>too</I>.  <a name="C1V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:37</font></a> As
Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and
make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.  <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the
Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule,
and brought him to Gihon.  <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> Zadok the priest took the horn of
oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all
the people said, <I>Long</I> live king Solomon.  <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> All the people came up after him,
and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the
earth shook with the sound of them.  <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> Adonijah and all the guests who
were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard
the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in
an uproar?  <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> While he yet
spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah
said, Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most
certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king:  <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> and the king has sent with him
Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride
on the king's mule;  <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> and
Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon;
and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again.
This is the noise that you have heard.  <a name="C1V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:46</font></a> Also Solomon sits on the throne
of the kingdom.  <a name="C1V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:47</font></a> Moreover
the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Your God
make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne
greater than your throne: and the king bowed himself on the bed.  <a name="C1V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:48</font></a> Also thus said the king, Blessed
be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this
day, my eyes even seeing it.  <a name="C1V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:49</font></a> All the guests of Adonijah were
afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.  <a name="C1V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:50</font></a> Adonijah feared because of
Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the
altar.  <a name="C1V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:51</font></a> It was told
Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has
laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me
first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.  <a name="C1V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:52</font></a> Solomon said, If he shall show
himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but
if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.  <a name="C1V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:53</font></a> So king Solomon sent, and they
brought him down from the altar. He came and did obeisance to king
Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now the days of David
drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
 <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> I am going the way of all
the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> and keep the instruction of Yahweh
your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, <I>and</I> his
commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that
which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you
do, and wherever you turn yourself.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> That Yahweh may establish his word
which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their
way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
 <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Moreover you know also
what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two
captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa
the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his
shoes that were on his feet.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Do therefore according to your
wisdom, and don't let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> But show kindness to the sons of
Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table;
for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Behold, there is with you Shimei
the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous
curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at
the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you to
death with the sword.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Now
therefore don't hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will
know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down
to Sheol with blood.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> David slept with his fathers, and
was buried in the city of David.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> The days that David reigned over
Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and
thirty-three years reigned he in Jerusalem.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Solomon sat on the throne of
David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith
came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, Come you peaceably? He
said, Peaceably.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> He said
moreover, I have somewhat to tell you. She said, Say on.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> He said, You know that the
kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should
reign: however the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's;
for it was his from Yahweh.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Now I ask one petition of you;
don't deny me. She said to him, Say on.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> He said, &quot;Please speak to
Solomon the king (for he will not tell you 'no'), that he give me Abishag
the Shunammite as wife.&quot;  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Bathsheba said, Well; I will
speak for you to the king.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Bathsheba therefore went to king
Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and
bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to
be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Then she said, I ask one small
petition of you; don't deny me. The king said to her, Ask on, my mother;
for I will not deny you.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> She said, Let Abishag the
Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> King Solomon answered his mother,
Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the
kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Then king Solomon swore by
Yahweh, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken
this word against his own life.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> Now therefore as Yahweh lives,
who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and
who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to
death this day.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> King
Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that
he died.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> To Abiathar the
priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are
worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you
bear the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you
were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar
from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh,
which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> The news came to Joab; for Joab
had turned after Adonijah, though he didn't turn after Absalom. Joab fled
to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> It was told king Solomon, Joab is
fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon
sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> Benaiah came to the Tent of
Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. He said, No; but
I will die here. Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said
Joab, and thus he answered me.  <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> The king said to him, Do as he
has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood,
which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.  <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> Yahweh will return his blood on
his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than
he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it,
<I>to wit</I>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and
Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.  <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> So shall their blood return on
the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever: but to David, and
to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace for
ever from Yahweh.  <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> Then
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and
he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <a name="C2V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:35</font></a> The king put Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada in his room over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king put
in the room of Abiathar.  <a name="C2V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:36</font></a> The king sent and called for
Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell
there, and don't go forth from there any where.  <a name="C2V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:37</font></a> For on the day you go out, and
pass over the brook Kidron, know you for certain that you shall surely
die: your blood shall be on your own head.  <a name="C2V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:38</font></a> Shimei said to the king, The
saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.
Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.  <a name="C2V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:39</font></a> It happened at the end of three
years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of
Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are
in Gath.  <a name="C2V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:40</font></a> Shimei arose,
and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants;
and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <a name="C2V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:41</font></a> It was told Solomon that Shimei
had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <a name="C2V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:42</font></a> The king sent and called for
Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to
you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad
any where, you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I
have heard is good.  <a name="C2V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:43</font></a> Why
then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have
instructed you with?  <a name="C2V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:44</font></a> The
king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart
is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore Yahweh shall
return your wickedness on your own head.  <a name="C2V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:45</font></a> But king Solomon shall be
blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh
forever.  <a name="C2V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:46</font></a> So the king
commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him,
so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Solomon made affinity
with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her
into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own
house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Only the people sacrificed
in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of
Yahweh until those days.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in
the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in
the high places.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> The king
went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a
thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to
Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
 <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Solomon said, You have
shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as
he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of
heart with you; and you have kept for him this great loving kindness, that
you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Now, Yahweh my God, you have made
your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child;
I don't know how to go out or come in.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Your servant is in the midst of
your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered
nor counted for multitude.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Give your servant therefore an
understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good
and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> The speech pleased the Lord, that
Solomon had asked this thing.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> God said to him, Because you have
asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have
asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but
have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> behold, I have done according to
your word: behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so
that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any
arise like you.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> I have
also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so
that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days.
 <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> If you will walk in my
ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David did
walk, then I will lengthen your days.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Solomon awoke; and behold, it was
a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Then there came two women who
were prostitutes, to the king, and stood before him.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> The one woman said, Oh, my lord,
I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with
her in the house.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> It
happened the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was
delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the
house, save we two in the house.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> This woman's child died in the
night, because she lay on it.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> She arose at midnight, and took
my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her
bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> When I rose in the morning to
give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in
the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> The other woman said, No; but the
living is my son, and the dead is your son. This said, No; but the dead is
your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
 <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Then said the king, The
one says, This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead: and the
other says, No; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living.
 <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> The king said, Get me a
sword. They brought a sword before the king.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> The king said, Divide the living
child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> Then spoke the woman whose the
living child was to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she
said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it. But
the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> Then the king answered, Give her
the living child, and in no way kill it: she is its mother.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> All Israel heard of the judgment
which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the
wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> King Solomon was king
over all Israel.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> These
were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
 <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the
sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
 <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> and Azariah the son of Nathan was
over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister,
<I>and</I> the king's friend;  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> and Ahishar was over the
household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced
labor.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Solomon had twelve
officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his
household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> These are their names: Ben Hur, in
the hill country of Ephraim;  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in
Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him
<I>pertained</I> Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Ben Abinadab, in all the height
of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife);  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Baana the son of Ahilud, in
Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath
Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
 <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Ben Geber, in Ramoth
Gilead (to him <I>pertained</I> the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh,
which are in Gilead; <I>even</I> to him <I>pertained</I> the region of
Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
 <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Ahinadab the son of Iddo,
in Mahanaim;  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Ahimaaz, in
Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher
and Bealoth;  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Jehoshaphat
the son of Paruah, in Issachar;  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Shimei the son of Ela, in
Benjamin;  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Geber the son
of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites
and of Og king of Bashan; and <I>he was</I> the only officer who was in
the land.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Judah and
Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and
drinking and making merry.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Solomon ruled over all the
kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border
of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his
life.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Solomon's provision
for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,
 <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> ten head of fat cattle,
and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep,
besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> For he had dominion over all
<I>the region</I> on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over
all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around
him.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> Judah and Israel
lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan
even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> Solomon had forty thousand stalls
of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> Those officers provided food for
king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in
his month; they let nothing be lacking.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> Barley also and straw for the
horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where <I>the
officers</I> were, every man according to his duty.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> God gave Solomon wisdom and
understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the
sand that is on the seashore.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> Solomon's wisdom excelled the
wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
 <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> For he was wiser than all
men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons
of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around.  <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> He spoke three thousand proverbs;
and his songs were one thousand five.  <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> He spoke of trees, from the cedar
that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he
spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
 <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> There came of all peoples
to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard
of his wisdom.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Hiram king of Tyre
sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him
king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
 <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Solomon sent to Hiram,
saying,  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> You know how that
David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for
the wars which were about him on every side, until Yahweh put them under
the soles of his feet.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> But
now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither
adversary, nor evil occurrence.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Behold, I purpose to build a house
for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying,
Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build the
house for my name.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Now
therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my
servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you hire for your
servants according to all that you shall say: for you know that there is
not among us any who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> It happened, when Hiram heard the
words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Yahweh
this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
 <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Hiram sent to Solomon,
saying, I have heard <I>the message</I> which you have sent to me: I will
do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
fir.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> My servants shall
bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts
to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them
to be broken up there, and you shall receive them; and you shall
accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> So Hiram gave Solomon timber of
cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Solomon gave Hiram twenty
thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures
of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he
promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two
made a league together.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> King Solomon raised a levy out of
all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> He sent them to Lebanon, ten
thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months
at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Solomon had seventy thousand who
bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
 <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> besides Solomon's chief
officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who
bore rule over the people who labored in the work.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> The king commanded, and they cut
out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with
worked stone.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Solomon's
builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and
prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
<p>  <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> It happened in the
four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out
of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel,
in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> The house
which king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its
breadth twenty <I>cubits</I>, and its height thirty cubits.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> The porch before the temple of the
house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the
house; <I>and</I> ten cubits was its breadth before the house.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> For the house he made windows of
fixed lattice work.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Against the wall of the house he
built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both
of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side chambers all around.
 <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> The nethermost story was
five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was
seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets <I>in the wall</I>
of the house all around, that <I>the beams</I> should not have hold in the
walls of the house.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> The
house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the
quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in
the house, while it was in building.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> The door for the middle side
chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding
stairs into the middle <I>story</I>, and out of the middle into the third.
 <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> So he built the house, and
finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
 <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> He built the stories
against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house
with timber of cedar.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> The
word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Concerning this house which you
are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances,
and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my
word with you, which I spoke to David your father.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> I will dwell among the children
of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> So Solomon built the house, and
finished it.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> He built the
walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the
house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with
wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> He built twenty cubits on the
hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls
<I>of the ceiling</I>: he built <I>them</I> for it within, for an oracle,
even for the most holy place.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> The house, that is, the temple
before <I>the oracle</I>, was forty cubits <I>long</I>.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> There was cedar on the house
within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no
stone seen.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> He prepared
an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> Within the oracle was <I>a space
of</I> twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty
cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered
the altar with cedar.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> So
Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of
gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> The whole house he overlaid with
gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged
to the oracle he overlaid with gold.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> In the oracle he made two
cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> Five cubits was the one wing of
the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the
uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten
cubits.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> The other cherub
was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
 <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> The height of the one
cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> He set the cherubim within the
inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that
the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub
touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst
of the house.  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> He overlaid
the cherubim with gold.  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> He carved all the walls of the
house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open
flowers, inside and outside.  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> The floor of the house he
overlaid with gold, inside and outside.  <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> For the entrance of the oracle he
made doors of olive wood: the lintel <I>and</I> door posts were a fifth
part <I>of the wall</I>.  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> So <I>he made</I> two doors of
olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and
open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the
cherubim, and on the palm trees.  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> So also made he for the entrance
of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part <I>of the
wall</I>;  <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> and two doors
of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two
leaves of the other door were folding.  <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> He carved <I>thereon</I> cherubim
and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on
the engraved work.  <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> He
built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of
cedar beams.  <a name="C6V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:37</font></a> In the
fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month
Ziv.  <a name="C6V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:38</font></a> In the eleventh
year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished
throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he
seven years in building it.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Solomon was building
his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> For he built the house of the
forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth
fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars,
with cedar beams on the pillars.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> It was covered with cedar above
over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
 <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> There were beams in three
rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> All the doors and posts were made
square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.
 <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> He made the porch of
pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a
porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> He made the porch of the throne
where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with
cedar from floor to floor.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> His house where he was to dwell,
the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a
house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this
porch.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> All these were of
costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws,
inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the
outside to the great court.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> The foundation was of costly
stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight
cubits.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Above were costly
stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> The great court around had three
courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court
of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> King Solomon sent and fetched
Hiram out of Tyre.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> He was
the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of
Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding
and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and
performed all his work.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> For he fashioned the two pillars
of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits
encircled either of them about.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> He made two capitals of molten
brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital
was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
 <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> There were nets of
checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on
the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other
capital.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> So he made the
pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the
capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other
capital.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> The capitals
that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four
cubits.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> There were
capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was
beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around
on the other capital.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> He
set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right
pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and
called its name Boaz.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> On
the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars
finished.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> He made the
molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its
height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Under its brim around there were
buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were
in two rows, cast when it was cast.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> It stood on twelve oxen, three
looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three
looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea
was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> It was a handbreadth thick: and
its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it
held two thousand baths.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> He made the ten bases of brass;
four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and
three cubits its height.  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> The work of the bases was on this
manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> and on the panels that were
between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there
was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of
hanging work.  <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> Every base
had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had
supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the
side of each.  <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> The mouth
of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round
after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth
were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.  <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> The four wheels were underneath
the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height
of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> The work of the wheels was like
the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their
spokes, and their naves, were all molten.  <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> There were four supports at the
four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself.  <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> In the top of the base was there
a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays
and its panels were of the same.  <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> On the plates of its stays, and
on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
the space of each, with wreaths all around.  <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> After this manner he made the ten
bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.  <a name="C7V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:38</font></a> He made ten basins of brass: one
basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on very
one of the ten bases one basin.  <a name="C7V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:39</font></a> He set the bases, five on the
right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he
set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
 <a name="C7V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:40</font></a> Hiram made the basins,
and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the
work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:  <a name="C7V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:41</font></a> the two pillars, and the two
bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of
the pillars;  <a name="C7V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:42</font></a> and the four
hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for
each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
pillars;  <a name="C7V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:43</font></a> and the ten
bases, and the ten basins on the bases;  <a name="C7V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:44</font></a> and the one sea, and the twelve
oxen under the sea;  <a name="C7V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:45</font></a> and
the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which
Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished
brass.  <a name="C7V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:46</font></a> In the plain of
the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and
Zarethan.  <a name="C7V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:47</font></a> Solomon left
all the vessels <I>unweighed</I>, because they were exceeding many: the
weight of the brass could not be found out.  <a name="C7V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:48</font></a> Solomon made all the vessels that
were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the
show bread was, of gold;  <a name="C7V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:49</font></a> and the lampstands, five on the
right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the
flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;  <a name="C7V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:50</font></a> and the cups, and the snuffers,
and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the
hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and
for the doors of the house, <I>to wit</I>, of the temple, of gold.  <a name="C7V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:51</font></a> Thus all the work that king
Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the
things which David his father had dedicated, <I>even</I> the silver, and
the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of
Yahweh.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Then Solomon assembled
the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city
of David, which is Zion.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> All the men of Israel assembled
themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is
the seventh month.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> All the
elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> They brought up the ark of Yahweh,
and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent;
even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> King Solomon and all the
congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before
the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor
numbered for multitude.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> The priests brought in the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the
most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> For the cherubim spread forth
their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark
and its poles above.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> The
poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy
place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they
are to this day.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> There was
nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at
Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they
came out of the land of Egypt.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> It came to pass, when the priests
were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of
Yahweh,  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> so that the
priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory
of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has
said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> I have surely built you a house
of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> The king turned his face about,
and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel
stood.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> He said, Blessed
be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your
father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Since the day that I brought
forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes
of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David
to be over my people Israel.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> Now it was in the heart of David
my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
 <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> But Yahweh said to David
my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you
did well that it was in your heart:  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> nevertheless you shall not build
the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall
build the house for my name.  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Yahweh has established his word
that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit
on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for
the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> There have I set a place for the
ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers,
when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Solomon stood before the altar of
Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his
hands toward heaven;  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> and
he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven
above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with
your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> who have kept with your servant
David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your
mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.  <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of
Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have
promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on
the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to
walk before me as you have walked before me.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> Now therefore, God of Israel,
Please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my
father.  <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> But will God in
very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens
can't contain you; how much less this house that I have built!  <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> Yet have respect for the prayer
of your servant, and for his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the
cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
 <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> that your eyes may be
open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you
have said, My name shall be there; to listen to the prayer which your
servant shall pray toward this place.  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Listen you to the supplication of
your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this
place: yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear,
forgive.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> If a man sin
against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear,
and he come <I>and</I> swear before your altar in this house;  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> then hear you in heaven, and do,
and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his
own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
righteousness.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> When your
people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned
against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray
and make supplication to you in this house:  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> then hear you in heaven, and
forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land
which you gave to their fathers.  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> When the sky is shut up, and
there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray
toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when
you do afflict them:  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> then
hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people
Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and
send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an
inheritance.  <a name="C8V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:37</font></a> If there be
in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight <I>or</I>
mildew, locust <I>or</I> caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the
land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;  <a name="C8V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:38</font></a> whatever prayer and supplication
be made by any man, <I>or</I> by all your people Israel, who shall know
every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward
this house:  <a name="C8V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:39</font></a> then hear in
heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man
according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only,
know the hearts of all the children of men;)  <a name="C8V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:40</font></a> that they may fear you all the
days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.  <a name="C8V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:41</font></a> Moreover concerning the
foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come out of a
far country for your name's sake  <a name="C8V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:42</font></a> (for they shall hear of your
great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when
he shall come and pray toward this house;  <a name="C8V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:43</font></a> hear in heaven, your dwelling
place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that
all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as does your
people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built
is called by my name.  <a name="C8V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:44</font></a> If
your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you
shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have
chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name;  <a name="C8V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:45</font></a> then hear in heaven their prayer
and their supplication, and maintain their cause.  <a name="C8V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:46</font></a> If they sin against you (for
there is no man who doesn't sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver
them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the
enemy, far off or near;  <a name="C8V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:47</font></a> yet if they shall repent
themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and
make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive,
saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
 <a name="C8V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:48</font></a> if they return to you
with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies,
who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you
gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which
I have built for your name:  <a name="C8V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:49</font></a> then hear you their prayer and
their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their
cause;  <a name="C8V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:50</font></a> and forgive your
people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which
they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those
who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them  <a name="C8V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:51</font></a> (for they are your people, and
your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of
the furnace of iron);  <a name="C8V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:52</font></a> that your eyes may be open to the
supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people
Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.  <a name="C8V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:53</font></a> For you did separate them from
among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke
by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord
Yahweh.  <a name="C8V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:54</font></a> It was so, that
when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication
to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his
knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.  <a name="C8V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:55</font></a> He stood, and blessed all the
assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,  <a name="C8V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:56</font></a> Blessed be Yahweh, who has given
rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has
not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses
his servant.  <a name="C8V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:57</font></a> Yahweh our
God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor
forsake us;  <a name="C8V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:58</font></a> that he may
incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our
fathers.  <a name="C8V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:59</font></a> Let these my
words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to
Yahweh our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant,
and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;  <a name="C8V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:60</font></a> that all the peoples of the earth
may know that Yahweh, he is God; there is none else.  <a name="C8V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:61</font></a> Let your heart therefore be
perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his
commandments, as at this day.  <a name="C8V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:62</font></a> The king, and all Israel with
him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.  <a name="C8V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:63</font></a> Solomon offered for the sacrifice
of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand
head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all
the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C8V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:64</font></a> The same day did the king make
the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for
there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of
the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was
too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the
fat of the peace offerings.  <a name="C8V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:65</font></a> So Solomon held the feast at that
time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of
Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven
days, even fourteen days.  <a name="C8V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:66</font></a> On the eighth day he sent the
people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and
glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his
servant, and to Israel his people.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> It happened, when
Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh, and the king's
house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> that Yahweh appeared to Solomon
the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Yahweh said to him, I have heard
your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have
made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever;
and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> As for you, if you will walk
before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in
uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will
keep my statutes and my ordinances;  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> then I will establish the throne
of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David your
father, saying, There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
 <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> But if you shall turn away
from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and
my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other
gods, and worship them;  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> then will I cut off Israel out of
the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy
for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb
and a byword among all peoples.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Though this house is so high, yet
shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they
shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
 <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> and they shall answer,
Because they forsook Yahweh their God, who brought forth their fathers out
of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and
served them: therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> It happened at the end of twenty
years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and
the king's house  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> (now
Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir
trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon
gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Hiram came out from Tyre to see
the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn't please him.
 <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> He said, What cities are
these which you have given me, my brother? He called them the land of
Cabul to this day.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Hiram
sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> This is the reason of the levy
which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and his own
house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
Gezer.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> Pharaoh king of
Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the
Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his
daughter, Solomon's wife.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Solomon built Gezer, and Beth
Horon the lower,  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> and
Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> and all the storage cities that
Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his
horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in
Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> As for all the people who were
left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> their children who were left
after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly
to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants to this day.
 <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> But of the children of
Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and
his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his
chariots and of his horsemen.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> These were the chief officers who
were over Solomon's work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the
people who labored in the work.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> But Pharaoh's daughter came up
out of the city of David to her house which <I>Solomon</I> had built for
her: then did he build Millo.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Three times a year did Solomon
offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to
Yahweh, burning incense therewith, <I>on the altar</I> that was before
Yahweh. So he finished the house.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> King Solomon made a navy of ships
in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the <a
href="#N1">Red Sea</a>, in the land of Edom.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> Hiram sent in the navy his
servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of
Solomon.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> They came to
Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and
brought it to king Solomon.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> When the queen of
Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh, she came
to prove him with hard questions.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> She came to Jerusalem with a very
great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and
precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of
all that was in her heart.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Solomon told her all her
questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn't
tell her.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> When the queen
of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had
built,  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> and the food of
his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his
ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by
which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.
 <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> She said to the king, It
was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your
wisdom.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> However I didn't
believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and behold, the
half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I
heard.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Happy are your
men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you,
<I>and</I> who hear your wisdom.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Blessed be Yahweh your God, who
delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because Yahweh loved
Israel forever, therefore made he you king, to do justice and
righteousness.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> She gave
the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great
store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as
these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> The navy also of Hiram, that
brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees
and precious stones.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> The
king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the
king's house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers: there
came no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> King Solomon gave to the queen
of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon
gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she
and her servants.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Now
the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred
sixty-six talents of gold,  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> besides <I>that which</I> the
traders <I>brought</I>, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the
kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> King Solomon made two hundred
bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred <I>shekels</I> of gold went to one
buckler.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> <I>he made</I>
three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one
shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
 <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Moreover the king made a
great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> There were six steps to the
throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays
on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the
stays.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Twelve lions
stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was
nothing like it made in any kingdom.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> All king Solomon's drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of
Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted
of in the days of Solomon.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> For the king had at sea a navy
of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy
of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
 <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> So king Solomon exceeded
all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> All the earth sought the
presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
 <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> They brought every man
his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and
armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Solomon gathered together
chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and
with the king at Jerusalem.  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> The king made silver to be in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that
are in the lowland, for abundance.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> The horses which Solomon had
were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in
droves, each drove at a price.  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> A chariot came up and went out
of Egypt for six hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and a horse for one
hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings
of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Now king Solomon loved
many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the
Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> of the nations concerning which
Yahweh said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them,
neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your
heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> He had seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his
heart.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> For it happened,
when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other
gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart
of David his father.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> For
Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after
Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Solomon did that which was evil
in the sight of Yahweh, and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did David his
father.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Then did Solomon
build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain
that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children
of Ammon.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> So did he for
all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
 <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Yahweh was angry with
Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel,
who had appeared to him twice,  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> and had commanded him concerning
this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn't keep
that which Yahweh commanded.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Therefore Yahweh said to
Solomon, Because this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant
and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the
kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Notwithstanding in your days I
will not do it, for David your father's sake: but I will tear it out of
the hand of your son.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> However I will not tear away all
the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant's
sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Yahweh raised up an adversary to
Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> For it happened, when David was
in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain,
and had struck every male in Edom  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> (for Joab and all Israel
remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
 <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> that Hadad fled, he and
certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt,
Hadad being yet a little child.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> They arose out of Midian, and
came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to
Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him
food, and gave him land.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> Hadad found great favor in the
sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife,
the sister of Tahpenes the queen.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> The sister of Tahpenes bore him
Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath
was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> When Hadad heard in Egypt that
David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was
dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own
country.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Then Pharaoh
said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go
to your own country? He answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.
 <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> God raised up
<I>another</I> adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled
from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> He gathered men to him, and
became captain over a troop, when David killed them <I>of Zobah</I>: and
they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> He was an adversary to Israel
all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad <I>did</I>: and
he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an
Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was
Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> This was the reason why he
lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the
breach of the city of David his father.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> The man Jeroboam was a mighty
man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and
he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> It happened at that time, when
Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite
found him in the way; now <I>Ahijah</I> had clad himself with a new
garment; and they two were alone in the field.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Ahijah laid hold of the new
garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> He said to Jeroboam, Take ten
pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the
kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you
 <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> (but he shall have one
tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city
which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> because that they have forsaken
me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the
god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have
not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and <I>to
keep</I> my statutes and my ordinances, as did David his father.  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> However I will not take the
whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of
his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my
commandments and my statutes;  <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> but I will take the kingdom out
of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.  <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> To his son will I give one
tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in
Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.  <a name="C11V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:37</font></a> I will take you, and you shall
reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over
Israel.  <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> It shall be, if
you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and
do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will
build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
 <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> I will for this afflict
the seed of David, but not forever.  <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> Solomon sought therefore to kill
Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of
Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.  <a name="C11V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:41</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren't they written in the
book of the acts of Solomon?  <a name="C11V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:42</font></a> The time that Solomon reigned in
Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.  <a name="C11V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:43</font></a> Solomon slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Rehoboam went to
Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> It happened, when Jeroboam the
son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from
the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> and they sent and called him),
that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam,
saying,  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Your father made
our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your
father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve
you.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> He said to them,
Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. The people departed.
 <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> King Rehoboam took
counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he
yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this
people?  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> They spoke to
him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will
serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will
be your servants forever.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> But he forsook the counsel of the
old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who
had grown up with him, who stood before him.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> He said to them, What counsel do
you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me,
saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> The young men who had grown up
with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell this people who spoke
to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter
to us; thus you shall speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my
father's waist.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> Now
whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke:
my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
scorpions.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> So Jeroboam
and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade,
saying, Come to me again the third day.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> The king answered the people
roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
 <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> and spoke to them after
the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but
I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will
chastise you with scorpions.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> So the king didn't listen to the
people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he might
establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
the son of Nebat.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> When
all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them, the people answered
the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we
inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, Israel: now see to your
own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> But as for the children of
Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
 <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> Then king Rehoboam sent
Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel
stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to
his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> So Israel rebelled against the
house of David to this day.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> It happened, when all Israel
heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the
congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who
followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> When Rehoboam was come to
Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin,
a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight
against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the
son of Solomon.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> But the
word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Speak to Rehoboam the son of
Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to
the rest of the people, saying,  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, You shall not
go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return
every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the
word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of
Yahweh.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Then Jeroboam
built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived therein; and he
went out from there, and built Penuel.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> Jeroboam said in his heart, Now
will the kingdom return to the house of David:  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> if this people go up to offer
sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of
this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and
they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> Whereupon the king took counsel,
and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you
to go up to Jerusalem: see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of
the land of Egypt.  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> He
set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> This thing became a sin; for the
people went <I>to worship</I> before the one, even to Dan.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> He made houses of high places,
and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of
Levi.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Jeroboam ordained
a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the
feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; so did he in Bethel,
sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the
priests of the high places that he had made.  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> He went up to the altar which he
had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the
month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for
the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Behold, there came a
man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was
standing by the altar to burn incense.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> He cried against the altar by the
word of Yahweh, and said, altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: Behold, a son
shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he
sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and
men's bones shall they burn on you.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> He gave a sign the same day,
saying, This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar shall
be torn, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> It happened, when the king heard
the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel,
that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not
draw it back again to him.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> The altar also was torn, and the
ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of
God had given by the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> The king answered the man of God,
Entreat now the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand
may be restored me again. The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king's
hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> The king said to the man of God,
Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
 <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> The man of God said to
the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you,
neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> for so was it commanded me by the
word of Yahweh, saying, You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither
return by the way that you came.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> So he went another way, and
didn't return by the way that he came to Bethel.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Now there lived an old prophet
in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the
man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to
the king, them also they told to their father.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Their father said to them, Which
way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who
came from Judah.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> He said
to his sons, Saddle me the donkey. So they saddled him the donkey; and he
rode thereon.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> He went
after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to
him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? He said, I am.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Then he said to him, Come home
with me, and eat bread.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> He said, I may not return with
you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you
in this place:  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> for it
was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no bread nor drink
water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> He said to him, I also am a
prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh,
saying, Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and
drink water. <I>But</I> he lied to him.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> So he went back with him, and
ate bread in his house, and drank water.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> It happened, as they sat at the
table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back;
 <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> and he cried to the man
of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have
been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment
which Yahweh your God commanded you,  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> but came back, and have eaten
bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, Eat no bread,
and drink no water; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
 <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> It happened, after he
had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the
donkey, <I>to wit</I>, for the prophet whom he had brought back.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> When he was gone, a lion met him
by the way, and killed him: and his body was cast in the way, and the
donkey stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> Behold, men passed by, and saw
the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came
and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> When the prophet who brought him
back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God, who was
disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh: therefore Yahweh has delivered him to
the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of
Yahweh, which he spoke to him.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> He spoke to his sons, saying,
Saddle me the donkey. They saddled it.  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> He went and found his body cast
in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body: the lion had
not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> The prophet took up the body of
the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back; and he
came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> He laid his body in his own
grave; and they mourned over him, <I>saying</I>, Alas, my brother!  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> It happened, after he had buried
him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in
the tomb in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
 <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> For the saying which he
cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all
the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall
surely happen.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> After
this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made again from
among all the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he
consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.  <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> This thing became sin to the
house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the
surface of the earth.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> At that time Abijah
the son of Jeroboam fell sick.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> Jeroboam said to his wife, Please
get up and disguise yourself, that you not be known to be the wife of
Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who
spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Take with you ten loaves, and
cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him: he will tell you what shall
become of the child.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> Jeroboam's wife did so, and
arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah
could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold,
the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is
sick: thus and thus you shall tell her; for it will be, when she comes in,
that she will feign herself to be another woman.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> It was so, when Ahijah heard the
sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you
wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to
you with heavy news.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Go,
tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Because I exalted you
from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> and tore the kingdom away from
the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my
servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his
heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> but have done evil above all who
were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images,
to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> therefore, behold, I will bring
evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who
<a href="#N2">urinates on a wall,</a> him who is shut up and him who is
left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of
Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it be all gone.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Him who dies of Jeroboam in the
city shall the dogs eat; and him who dies in the field shall the birds of
the sky eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Arise you therefore, get you to
your house: <I>and</I> when your feet enter into the city, the child shall
die.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> All Israel shall
mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the
grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the
God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Moreover Yahweh will raise him
up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day:
but what? even now.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> For
Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will
root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and
will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim,
provoking Yahweh to anger.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> He will give Israel up because
of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made
Israel to sin.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> Jeroboam's wife arose, and
departed, and came to Tirzah: <I>and</I> as she came to the threshold of
the house, the child died.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> All Israel buried him, and
mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his
servant Ahijah the prophet.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> The rest of the acts of
Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> The days which Jeroboam reigned
were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his
son reigned in his place.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> Rehoboam the son of Solomon
reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his
mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Judah did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins
which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> For they also built them high
places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every
green tree;  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> and there
were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the
abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of
Israel.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> It happened in
the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up
against Jerusalem;  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> and
he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of
the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields
of gold which Solomon had made.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> King Rehoboam made in their
place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of
the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> It was so, that as often as the
king went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them
back into the guard chamber.  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> There was war between Rehoboam
and Jeroboam continually.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother's
name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Now in the eighteenth
year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.
 <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Three years reigned he in
Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
 <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> He walked in all the sins
of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect
with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Nevertheless for David's sake did
Yahweh his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him,
and to establish Jerusalem;  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> because David did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn't turn aside from anything that he
commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah
the Hittite.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Now there
was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> The rest of the acts of Abijam,
and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> Abijam slept with his fathers;
and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his
place.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> In the twentieth
year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> Forty-one years reigned he in
Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
 <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Asa did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did David his father.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> He put away the sodomites out of
the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> Also Maacah his mother he
removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an
Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
 <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> But the high places were
not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all
his days.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> He brought
into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated, and the
things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel all their days.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> Baasha king of Israel went up
against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out
or come in to Asa king of Judah.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> Then Asa took all the silver and
the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the
treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the
son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> <I>There is</I> a league between
me and you, between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you
a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of
Israel, that he may depart from me.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> Ben Hadad listened to king Asa,
and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and
struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all
the land of Naphtali.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> It
happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and
lived in Tirzah.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> Then
king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they
carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had
built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> Now the rest of all the acts of
Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he
built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Asa slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> Nadab the son of Jeroboam began
to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he
reigned over Israel two years.  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin
with which he made Israel to sin.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the
house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at
Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
were laying siege to Gibbethon.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> Even in the third year of Asa
king of Judah did Baasha kill him, and reigned in his place.  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> It happened that, as soon as he
was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he didn't leave to Jeroboam
any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of
Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> for the sins of Jeroboam which
he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his
provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
 <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> Now the rest of the acts
of Nadab, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel all their days.  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> In the third year of Asa king of
Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah,
<I>and reigned</I> twenty-four years.  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin
with which he made Israel to sin.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> Because I exalted you out of the
dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in
the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me
to anger with their sins;  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> behold, I will utterly sweep away
Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> Him who dies of Baasha in the
city shall the dogs eat; and him who dies of his in the field shall the
birds of the sky eat.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> Now
the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren't
they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Baasha slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Moreover by the prophet Jehu the
son of Hanani came the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his
house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, to
provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house
of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> In the twenty-sixth year of Asa
king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah,
<I>and reigned</I> two years.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> His servant Zimri, captain of
half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking
himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
 <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> and Zimri went in and
struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of
Judah, and reigned in his place.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> It happened, when he began to
reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of
Baasha: he didn't leave him a single one <a href="#N3">who urinates on a
wall,</a> neither of his relatives, nor of his friends.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> Thus Zimri destroyed all the
house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against
Baasha by Jehu the prophet,  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> for all the sins of Baasha, and
the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made
Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their
vanities.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Now the rest
of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> In the twenty-seventh year of
Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people
were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
 <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> The people who were
encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king:
therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel
that day in the camp.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> Omri went up from Gibbethon, and
all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> It happened, when Zimri saw that
the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and
burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> for his sins which he sinned in
doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of
Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Zimri, and his treason that he did, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> Then were the people of Israel
divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of
Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> But the people who followed Omri
prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so
Tibni died, and Omri reigned.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> In the thirty-first year of Asa
king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, <I>and reigned</I> twelve
years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> He bought the hill Samaria of
Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the
name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of
the hill, Samaria.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> Omri
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above
all who were before him.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> For he walked in all the way of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to
sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
 <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> Now the rest of the acts
of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren't they written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> So Omri slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> In the thirty-eighth year of Asa
king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab
the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.  <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> Ahab the son of Omri did that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him.
 <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> It happened, as if it
had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the
Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.  <a name="C16V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:32</font></a> He reared up an altar for Baal
in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.  <a name="C16V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:33</font></a> Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab
did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the
kings of Israel who were before him.  <a name="C16V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:34</font></a> In his days did Hiel the
Bethelite build Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram
his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son
Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Joshua the son
of Nun.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Elijah the Tishbite,
who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, As Yahweh, the God of
Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these
years, but according to my word.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to him,
saying,  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> Get you hence,
and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is
before the Jordan.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> It
shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the
ravens to feed you there.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> So he went and did according to
the word of Yahweh; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, that is
before the Jordan.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> The
ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in
the evening; and he drank of the brook.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> It happened after a while, that
the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to him,
saying,  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Arise, get you to
Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have
commanded a widow there to sustain you.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> So he arose and went to
Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was
there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Please get me a
little water in a vessel, that I may drink.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> As she was going to get it, he
called to her, and said, Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
 <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> She said, As Yahweh your
God lives, I don't have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a
little oil in the jar: and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may
go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Elijah said to her, Don't be
afraid; go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first,
and bring it forth to me, and afterward make for you and for your son.
 <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> For thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar
of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> She went and did according to
the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate <I>many</I>
days.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> The jar of meal
didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of
Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> It happened after these things,
that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his
sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> She said to Elijah, What have I
to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to
memory, and to kill my son!  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> He said to her, Give me your
son. He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber,
where he abode, and laid him on his own bed.  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> He cried to Yahweh, and said,
Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I
sojourn, by killing her son?  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> He stretched himself on the
child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, please
let this child's soul come into him again.  <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> Yahweh listened to the voice of
Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
 <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> Elijah took the child,
and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him
to his mother; and Elijah said, Behold, your son lives.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> The woman said to Elijah, Now I
know that you are a man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth
is truth.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> It happened after many
days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying,
Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Elijah went to show himself to
Ahab. The famine was sore in Samaria.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> Ahab called Obadiah, who was over
the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> for it was so, when Jezebel cut
off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and
hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through
the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks: peradventure
we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose
all the animals.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> So they
divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by
himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> As Obadiah was in the way,
behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said,
Is it you, my lord Elijah?  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> He answered him, It is I: go,
tell your lord, Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> He said, Wherein have I sinned,
that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
 <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> As Yahweh your God
lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek
you: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom
and nation, that they didn't find you.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Now you say, Go, tell your lord,
Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> It will happen, as soon as I am
gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don't know
where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will
kill me: but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> Wasn't it told my lord what I
did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men
of Yahweh's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
water?  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Now you say, Go,
tell your lord, Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>; and he will kill me.
 <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Elijah said, As Yahweh
of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him
today.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> So Obadiah went
to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> It happened, when Ahab saw
Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> He answered, I have not troubled
Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the
commandments of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Now therefore send, and gather
to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred
fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's
table.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> So Ahab sent to
all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount
Carmel.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Elijah came near
to all the people, and said, &quot;How long will you waver between the two
sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.&quot;
The people answered him not a word.  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Then Elijah said to the people,
&quot;I, even I only, am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are
four hundred fifty men.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Let them therefore give us two
bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces,
and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other
bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> You call on the name of your
god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh; and the God who answers by
fire, let him be God.&quot;
<p>All the people answered, &quot;It is well said.&quot;  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Elijah said to the prophets of
Baal, &quot;Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you
are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> They took the bull
which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal
from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no
voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.
 <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> It happened at noon,
that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he
is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he
sleeps and must be awakened.  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> They cried aloud, and cut
themselves after their manner with knives and lances, until the blood
gushed out on them.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> It
was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the
offering of the <I>evening</I> offering; but there was neither voice, nor
any to answer, nor any who regarded.  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> Elijah said to all the people,
Come near to me; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the
altar of Yahweh that was thrown down.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> Elijah took twelve stones,
according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the
word of Yahweh came, saying, Israel shall be your name.  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> With the stones he built an
altar in the name of Yahweh; and he made a trench about the altar, as
great as would contain two measures of seed.  <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> He put the wood in order, and
cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, Fill four jars
with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.  <a name="C18V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:34</font></a> He said, Do it the second time;
and they did it the second time. He said, Do it the third time; and they
did it the third time.  <a name="C18V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:35</font></a> The water ran around the altar;
and he filled the trench also with water.  <a name="C18V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:36</font></a> It happened at the time of the
offering of the <I>evening</I> offering, that Elijah the prophet came
near, and said, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let
it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your
servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.  <a name="C18V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:37</font></a> Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that
this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and <I>that</I> you have
turned their heart back again.  <a name="C18V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:38</font></a> Then the fire of Yahweh fell,
and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the
dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <a name="C18V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:39</font></a> When all the people saw it, they
fell on their faces: and they said, Yahweh, he is God; Yahweh, he is God.
 <a name="C18V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:40</font></a> and Elijah said to them,
Take the prophets of Baal; don't let one of them escape. They took them;
and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
 <a name="C18V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:41</font></a> Elijah said to Ahab, Get
you up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
 <a name="C18V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:42</font></a> So Ahab went up to eat
and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself
down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.  <a name="C18V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:43</font></a> He said to his servant, Go up
now, look toward the sea. He went up, and looked, and said, There is
nothing. He said, Go again seven times.  <a name="C18V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:44</font></a> It happened at the seventh time,
that he said, &quot;Behold, a small cloud, like a man's hand, is rising
out of the sea.&quot; He said, Go up, tell Ahab, Make ready <I>your
chariot</I>, and get you down, that the rain not stop you.  <a name="C18V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:45</font></a> It happened in a little while,
that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.
Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:  <a name="C18V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:46</font></a> and the hand of Yahweh was on
Elijah; and he girded up his waist, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of
Jezreel.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> Ahab told Jezebel all
that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the
sword.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> Then Jezebel send
a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if
I don't make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this
time.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> When he saw that,
he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to
Judah, and left his servant there.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> But he himself went a day's
journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree:
and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough;
now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
 <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> He lay down and slept
under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him,
Arise and eat.  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> He looked,
and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of
water. He ate and drink, and laid him down again.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> The angel of Yahweh came again
the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the
journey is too great for you.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> He arose, and ate and drink, and
went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the
Mount of God.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> He came
there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of Yahweh came to
him, and he said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> He said, I have been very
jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have
forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets
with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
take it away.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> He said,
Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh. Behold, Yahweh passed
by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces
the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind: and after the
wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake:  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> and after the earthquake a fire;
but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
 <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> It was so, when Elijah
heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood
in the entrance of the cave. Behold, there came a voice to him, and said,
What are you doing here, Elijah?  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> He said, I have been very
jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have
forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets
with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
take it away.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> Yahweh
said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and
when you come, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> and you shall anoint Jehu the
son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son
of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your room.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> It shall happen, that he who
escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu kill; and he who escapes from
the sword of Jehu shall Elisha kill.  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> Yet will I leave <I>me</I> seven
thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every
mouth which has not kissed him.  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> So he departed there, and found
Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke <I>of
oxen</I> before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to
him, and cast his mantle on him.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> He left the oxen, and ran after
Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and
then I will follow you. He said to him, Go back again; for what have I
done to you?  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> He returned
from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled
their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and
they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Ben Hadad the king of
Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with
him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and
fought against it.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> He
sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him,
Thus says Ben Hadad,  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> Your
silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the
best, are mine.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> The king
of Israel answered, It is according to your saying, my lord, O king; I am
yours, and all that I have.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> The messengers came again, and
said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad, saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You
shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your
children;  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> but I will send
my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your
house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is
pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
 <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Then the king of Israel
called all the elders of the land, and said, Please notice how this man
seeks mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and
for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn't deny him.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> All the elders and all the people
said to him, Don't you listen, neither consent.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> Therefore he said to the
messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for
to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. The
messengers departed, and brought him word again.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> Ben Hadad sent to him, and said,
The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice
for handfuls for all the people who follow me.  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> The king of Israel answered,
Tell him, Don't let him who girds on <I>his armor</I> boast himself as he
who puts it off.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> It
happened, when <I>Ben Hadad</I> heard this message, as he was drinking, he
and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set
<I>yourselves in array</I>. They set <I>themselves in array</I> against
the city.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> Behold, a
prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Have
you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your
hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Ahab said, By whom? He said,
Thus says Yahweh, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then
he said, Who shall begin the battle? He answered, You.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Then he mustered the young men
of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two:
and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of
Israel, being seven thousand.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> They went out at noon. But Ben
Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the
thirty-two kings who helped him.  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> The young men of the princes of
the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him,
saying, There are men come out from Samaria.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> He said, Whether they are come
out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war,
taken them alive.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> So
these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces,
and the army which followed them.  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> They killed everyone his man;
and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben Hadad the king of
Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> The king of Israel went out, and
struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great
slaughter.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> The prophet
came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself,
and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of
Syria will come up against you.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> The servants of the king of
Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were
stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely
we shall be stronger than they.  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> Do this thing: take the kings
away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> and number you an army, like the
army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we
will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than
they. He listened to their voice, and did so.  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> It happened at the return of the
year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight
against Israel.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> The
children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against
them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little
flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.  <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> A man of God came near and spoke
to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians
have said, Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the
valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand,
and you shall know that I am Yahweh.  <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> They encamped one over against
the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was
joined; and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred
thousand footmen in one day.  <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> But the rest fled to Aphek, into
the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left.
Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> His servants said to him, See
now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful
kings: let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our
heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your
life.  <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> So they girded
sackcloth on their bodies, and <I>put</I> ropes on their heads, and came
to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let
me live. He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.  <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> Now the men observed diligently,
and hurried to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your brother
Ben Hadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Ben Hadad came forth to
him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.  <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> <I>Ben Hadad</I> said to him,
The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you
shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. I,
<I>said Ahab</I>, will let you go with this covenant. So he made a
covenant with him, and let him go.  <a name="C20V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:35</font></a> A certain man of the sons of the
prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The
man refused to strike him.  <a name="C20V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:36</font></a> Then said he to him, Because you
have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed
from me, a lion shall kill you. As soon as he was departed from him, a
lion found him, and killed him.  <a name="C20V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:37</font></a> Then he found another man, and
said, Please strike me. The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.
 <a name="C20V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:38</font></a> So the prophet departed,
and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his
headband over his eyes.  <a name="C20V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:39</font></a> As the king passed by, he cried
to the king; and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the
battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said,
Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then your life shall be for
his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.  <a name="C20V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:40</font></a> As your servant was busy here
and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, So your judgment
shall be; yourself have decided it.  <a name="C20V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:41</font></a> He hurried, and took the
headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he
was of the prophets.  <a name="C20V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:42</font></a> He
said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go out of your hand
the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go
for his life, and your people for his people.  <a name="C20V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:43</font></a> The king of Israel went to his
house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> It happened after
these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in
Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying,
Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because
it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than
it: or, if it seem good to you, I will give you its worth in money.
 <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Naboth said to Ahab,
Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to
you.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Ahab came into his
house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had
spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my
fathers. He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would
eat no bread.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> But Jezebel
his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you
eat no bread?  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> He said to
her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me
your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you
<I>another</I> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my
vineyard.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> Jezebel his
wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat
bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> So she
wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the
letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, <I>and</I>
who lived with Naboth.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> She wrote in the letters, saying,
Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> and set two men, base fellows,
before him, and let them testify against him, saying, You did curse God
and the king. Then carry him out, and stone him to death.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> The men of his city, even the
elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to
them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to
them.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> They proclaimed a
fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> The two men, the base fellows,
came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bore witness against him,
even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and
stoned him to death with stones.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> Then they sent to Jezebel,
saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> It happened, when Jezebel heard
that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise,
take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused
to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> It happened, when Ahab heard
that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to
Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> Arise, go down to meet Ahab king
of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth,
where he is gone down to take possession of it.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> You shall speak to him, saying,
Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? You shall
speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the
blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> Ahab said to Elijah, Have you
found me, my enemy? He answered, I have found you, because you have sold
yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Behold, I will bring evil on
you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone
<a href="#N4">who urinates against a wall,</a> and him who is shut up and
him who is left at large in Israel:  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> and I will make your house like
the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the
son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to
anger, and have made Israel to sin.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh,
saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> Him who dies of Ahab in the city
the dogs shall eat; and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the
sky eat.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> (But there was
none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> He did very abominably in
following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast
out before the children of Israel.)  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> It happened, when Ahab heard
those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and
fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.  <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to
Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> See you how Ahab humbles himself
before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil
in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> They continued three
years without war between Syria and Israel.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> It happened in the third year,
that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
 <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> The king of Israel said
to his servants, &quot;You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are
still, and don't take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?&quot;
 <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> He said to Jehoshaphat,
Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat said to the
king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as
your horses.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> Jehoshaphat
said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.
 <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> Then the king of Israel
gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them,
Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said,
Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there
here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh,
Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said, &quot;Don't let the king say
so.&quot;  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> Then the king
of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of
Imlah.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Now the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne,
arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of
Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah
made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these you shall
push the Syrians, until they are consumed.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> All the prophets prophesied so,
saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it
into the hand of the king.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> The messenger who went to call
Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now, the words of the prophets
<I>declare</I> good to the king with one mouth: please let your word be
like the word of one of them, and speak you good.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives,
what Yahweh says to me, that will I speak.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> When he was come to the king,
the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or
shall we forbear? He answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will
deliver it into the hand of the king.  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> The king said to him, How many
times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the
name of Yahweh?  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> He said,
I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no
shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every man
to his house in peace.  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning
me, but evil?  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> <I>Micaiah</I> said,
&quot;Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his
throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and
on his left.  <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> Yahweh
said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth
Gilead?' One said on this manner; and another said on that manner.  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> There came forth a spirit, and
stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.'  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> Yahweh said to him, 'How?' He
said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets.' He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go
forth, and do so.'  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> Now
therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these
your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.&quot;  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> Then Zedekiah the son of
Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way
went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> Micaiah said, Behold, you shall
see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
 <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> The king of Israel said,
Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to
Joash the king's son;  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> and say, Thus says the king, Put
this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with
water of affliction, until I come in peace.  <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> Micaiah said, If you return at
all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. He said, Hear, you peoples, all
of you.  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> So the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you
on your robes. The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
battle.  <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> Now the king of
Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight
neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.  <a name="C22V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:32</font></a> It happened, when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of
Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried
out.  <a name="C22V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:33</font></a> It happened, when
the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that
they turned back from pursuing him.  <a name="C22V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:34</font></a> A certain man drew his bow at a
venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor:
therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry
me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.  <a name="C22V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:35</font></a> The battle increased that day:
and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at
even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
 <a name="C22V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:36</font></a> There went a cry
throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to
his city, and every man to his country.  <a name="C22V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:37</font></a> So the king died, and was
brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.  <a name="C22V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:38</font></a> They washed the chariot by the
pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the prostitutes
washed themselves <I>there</I>); according to the word of Yahweh which he
spoke.  <a name="C22V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:39</font></a> Now the rest of
the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built,
and all the cities that he built, aren't they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <a name="C22V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:40</font></a> So Ahab slept with his fathers;
and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C22V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:41</font></a> Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began
to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.  <a name="C22V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:42</font></a> Jehoshaphat was thirty-five
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.  <a name="C22V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:43</font></a> He walked in all the way of Asa
his father; He didn't turn aside from it, doing that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the
people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.  <a name="C22V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:44</font></a> Jehoshaphat made peace with the
king of Israel.  <a name="C22V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:45</font></a> Now the
rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he
warred, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?  <a name="C22V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:46</font></a> The remnant of
the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away
out of the land.  <a name="C22V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:47</font></a> There
was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.  <a name="C22V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:48</font></a> Jehoshaphat made ships of
Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn't go; for the ships were
broken at Ezion Geber.  <a name="C22V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:49</font></a> Then said Ahaziah the son of
Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.
But Jehoshaphat would not.  <a name="C22V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:50</font></a> Jehoshaphat slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father;
Jehoram his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C22V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:51</font></a> Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to
reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king
of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.  <a name="C22V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:52</font></a> He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way
of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he
made Israel to sin.  <a name="C22V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:53</font></a> He
served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of
Israel, according to all that his father had done.

<p>This file should be named web1110h.htm or web1110h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web1110ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
