<h1>MRS. CAUDLE&rsquo;S CURTAIN LECTURES BY DOUGLAS JERROLD</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It has happened to the writer that two, or three, or ten, or twenty
gentlewomen have asked him - and asked in various notes of wonder, pity,
and reproof -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What could have made you think of Mrs. Caudle</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How could such a thing have entered any man&rsquo;s mind</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are subjects that seem like rain drops to fall upon a man&rsquo;s
head, the head itself having nothing to do with the matter.&nbsp; The
result of no train of thought, there is the picture, the statue, the
book, wafted, like the smallest seed, into the brain to feed upon the
soil, such as it may be, and grow there.&nbsp; And this was, no doubt,
the accidental cause of the literary sowing and expansion - unfolding
like a night-flower - of MRS. CAUDLE.</p>
<p>But let a jury of gentlewomen decide.</p>
<p>It was a thick, black wintry afternoon, when the writer stopt in
the front of the playground of a suburban school.&nbsp; The ground swarmed
with boys full of the Saturday&rsquo;s holiday.&nbsp; The earth seemed
roofed with the oldest lead, and the wind came, sharp as Shylock&rsquo;s
knife, from the Minories.&nbsp; But those happy boys ran and jumped,
and hopped, and shouted, and - unconscious men in miniature! - in their
own world of frolic, had no thought of the full-length men they would
some day become; drawn out into grave citizenship; formal, respectable,
responsible.&nbsp; To them the sky was of any or all colours; and for
that keen east wind - if it was called the east wind - cutting the shoulder-blades
of old, old men of forty <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
- they in their immortality of boyhood had the redder faces, and the
nimbler blood for it.</p>
<p>And the writer, looking dreamily into that playground, still mused
on the robust jollity of those little fellows, to whom the tax-gatherer
was as yet a rarer animal than baby hippopotamus.&nbsp; Heroic boyhood,
so ignorant of the future in the knowing enjoyment of the present!&nbsp;
And the writer still dreaming and musing, and still following no distinct
line of thought, there struck upon him, like notes of sudden household
music, these words - CURTAIN LECTURES.</p>
<p>One moment there was no living object save those racing, shouting
boys; and the next, as though a white dove had alighted on the pen hand
of the writer, there was - MRS. CAUDLE.</p>
<p>Ladies of the jury, are there not then some subjects of letters that
mysteriously assert an effect without any discoverable cause?&nbsp;
Otherwise, wherefore should the thought of CURTAIN LECTURES grow from
a school ground - wherefore, among a crowd of holiday school-boys, should
appear MRS. CAUDLE?</p>
<p>For the LECTURES themselves, it is feared they must be given up as
a farcical desecration of a solemn time-honoured privilege; it may be,
exercised once in a life time, - and that once having the effect of
a hundred repetitions, as Job lectured his wife.&nbsp; And Job&rsquo;s
wife, a certain Mohammedan writer delivers, having committed a fault
in her love to her husband, he swore that on his recovery he would deal
her a hundred stripes.&nbsp; Job got well, and his heart was touched
and taught by the tenderness to keep his vow, and still to chastise
his help-mate; for he smote her once with a palm-branch having a hundred
leaves.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS JERROLD.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Poor Job Caudle was one of the few men whom Nature, in her casual
bounty to women, sends into the world as patient listeners.&nbsp; He
was, perhaps, in more respects than one, all ears.&nbsp; And these ears,
Mrs. Caudle - his lawful, wedded wife as she would ever and anon impress
upon him, for she was not a woman to wear chains without shaking them
- took whole and sole possession of.&nbsp; They were her entire property;
as expressly made to convey to Caudle&rsquo;s brain the stream of wisdom
that continually flowed from the lips of his wife, as was the tin funnel
through which Mrs. Caudle in vintage time bottled her elder wine.&nbsp;
There was, however, this difference between the wisdom and the wine.&nbsp;
The wine was always sugared: the wisdom, never.&nbsp; It was expressed
crude from the heart of Mrs. Caudle; who, doubtless, trusted to the
sweetness of her husband&rsquo;s disposition to make it agree with him.</p>
<p>Philosophers have debated whether morning or night is most conducive
to the strongest and clearest moral impressions.&nbsp; The Grecian sage
confessed that his labours smelt of the lamp.&nbsp; In like manner did
Mrs. Caudle&rsquo;s wisdom smell of the rushlight.&nbsp; She knew that
her husband was too much distracted by his business as toyman and doll-merchant
to digest her lessons in the broad day.&nbsp; Besides, she could never
make sure of him: he was always liable to be summoned to the shop.&nbsp;
Now from eleven at night until seven in the morning there was no retreat
for him.&nbsp; He was compelled to lie and listen.&nbsp; Perhaps there
was little magnanimity in this on the part of Mrs. Caudle; but in marriage,
as in war, it is permitted to take every advantage of the enemy.&nbsp;
Besides, Mrs. Caudle copied very ancient and classic authority.&nbsp;
Minerva&rsquo;s bird, the very wisest thing in feathers, is silent all
the day.&nbsp; So was Mrs. Caudle.&nbsp; Like the owl, she hooted only
at night.</p>
<p>Mr. Caudle was blessed with an indomitable constitution.&nbsp; One
fact will prove the truth of this.&nbsp; He lived thirty years with
Mrs. Caudle, surviving her.&nbsp; Yes, it took thirty years for Mrs.
Caudle to lecture and dilate upon the joys, griefs, duties, and vicissitudes
comprised within that seemingly small circle - the wedding-ring.&nbsp;
We say, seemingly small; for the thing, as viewed by the vulgar, naked
eye, is a tiny hoop made for the third feminine finger.&nbsp; Alack!
like the ring of Saturn, for good or evil, it circles a whole world.&nbsp;
Or, to take a less gigantic figure, it compasses a vast region: it may
be Arabia Felix, and it may be Arabia Petrea.</p>
<p>A lemon-hearted cynic might liken the wedding-ring to an ancient
circus, in which wild animals clawed one another for the sport of lookers-on.&nbsp;
Perish the hyperbole!&nbsp; We would rather compare it to an elfin ring,
in which dancing fairies made the sweetest music for infirm humanity.</p>
<p>Manifold are the uses of rings.&nbsp; Even swine are tamed by them.&nbsp;
You will see a vagrant, hilarious, devastating porker - a full-blooded
fellow that would bleed into many, many fathoms of black pudding - you
will see him, escaped from his proper home, straying in a neighbour&rsquo;s
garden.&nbsp; How he tramples upon the heart&rsquo;s-ease: how, with
quivering snout, he roots up lilies - odoriferous bulbs!&nbsp; Here
he gives a reckless snatch at thyme and marjoram - and here he munches
violets and gilly-flowers.&nbsp; At length the marauder is detected,
seized by his owner, and driven, beaten home.&nbsp; To make the porker
less dangerous, it is determined that he shall be <i>ringed</i>.&nbsp;
The sentence is pronounced - execution ordered.&nbsp; Listen to his
screams!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you not think the knife was in his throat?<br />And
yet they&rsquo;re only boring through his nose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Hence, for all future time, the porker behaves himself with a sort
of forced propriety - for in either nostril he carries a ring.&nbsp;
It is, for the greatness of humanity, a saddening thought, that sometimes
men must be treated no better than pigs.</p>
<p>But Mr. Job Caudle was not of these men.&nbsp; Marriage to him was
not made a necessity.&nbsp; No; for him call it if you will a happy
chance - a golden accident.&nbsp; It is, however, enough for us to know
that he was married; and was therefore made the recipient of a wife&rsquo;s
wisdom.&nbsp; Mrs. Caudle, like Mahomet&rsquo;s dove, continually pecked
at the good man&rsquo;s ears; and it is a happiness to learn from what
he left behind that he had hived all her sayings in his brain; and further,
that he employed the mellow evening of his life to put such sayings
down, that, in due season, they might be enshrined in imperishable type.</p>
<p>When Mr. Job Caudle was left in this briary world without his daily
guide and nocturnal monitress, he was in the ripe fulness of fifty-seven.&nbsp;
For three hours at least after he went to bed - such slaves are we to
habit - he could not close an eye.&nbsp; His wife still talked at his
side.&nbsp; True it was, she was dead and decently interred.&nbsp; His
mind - it was a comfort to know it - could not wander on this point;
this he knew.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his wife was with him.&nbsp; The Ghost
of her Tongue still talked as in the life; and again and again did Job
Caudle hear the monitions of bygone years.&nbsp; At times, so loud,
so lively, so real were the sounds, that Job, with a cold chill, doubted
if he were really widowed.&nbsp; And then, with the movement of an arm,
a foot, he would assure himself that he was alone in his holland.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the talk continued.&nbsp; It was terrible to be thus haunted
by a voice: to have advice, commands, remonstrance, all sorts of saws
and adages still poured upon him, and no visible wife.&nbsp; Now did
the voice speak from the curtains; now from the tester; and now did
it whisper to Job from the very pillow that he pressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a dreadful thing that her tongue should walk in this manner,&rdquo;
said Job, and then he thought confusedly of exorcism, or at least of
counsel from the parish priest.</p>
<p>Whether Job followed his own brain, or the wise direction of another,
we know not.&nbsp; But he resolved every night to commit to paper one
curtain lecture of his late wife.&nbsp; The employment would, possibly,
lay the ghost that haunted him.&nbsp; It was her dear tongue that cried
for justice, and when thus satisfied, it might possibly rest in quiet.&nbsp;
And so it happened.&nbsp; Job faithfully chronicled all his late wife&rsquo;s
lectures; the ghost of her tongue was thenceforth silent, and Job slept
all his after nights in peace.</p>
<p>When Job died, a small packet of papers was found inscribed as follows:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Curtain Lectures delivered in the course of Thirty Years
by Mrs. Margaret Caudle</i>,<i> and suffered by Job</i>,<i> her Husband</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>That Mr. Caudle had his eye upon the future printer, is made pretty
probable by the fact that in most places he had affixed the text - such
text for the most part arising out of his own daily conduct - to the
lecture of the night.&nbsp; He had also, with an instinctive knowledge
of the dignity of literature, left a bank-note of very fair amount with
the manuscript.&nbsp; Following our duty as editor, we trust we have
done justice to both documents.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE I - MR. CAUDLE HAS LENT FIVE POUNDS TO A FRIEND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be very rich, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; I wonder who&rsquo;d
lend you five pounds?&nbsp; But so it is: a wife may work and may slave!&nbsp;
Ha, dear! the many things that might have been done with five pounds.&nbsp;
As if people picked up money in the street!&nbsp; But you always were
a fool, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve wanted a black satin gown these
three years, and that five pounds would have entirely bought it.&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s no matter how I go, - not at all.&nbsp; Everybody says
I don&rsquo;t dress as becomes your wife - and I don&rsquo;t; but what&rsquo;s
that to you, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Oh, no! you can have fine
feelings for everybody but those belonging to you.&nbsp; I wish people
knew you, as I do - that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; You like to be called liberal
- and your poor family pays for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the girls want bonnets, and where they&rsquo;re to come
from I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; Half five pounds would have bought &rsquo;em
- but now they must go without.&nbsp; Of course, <i>they</i> belong
to you: and anybody but your own flesh and body, Mr. Caudle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man called for the water-rate to-day; but I should like
to know how people are to pay taxes, who throw away five pounds to every
fellow that asks them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that Jack, this morning, knocked
his shuttlecock through his bedroom window.&nbsp; I was going to send
for the glazier to mend it; but after you lent that five pounds I was
sure we couldn&rsquo;t afford it.&nbsp; Oh, no! the window must go as
it is; and pretty weather for a dear child to sleep with a broken window.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got a cold already on his lungs, and I shouldn&rsquo;t at
all wonder if that broken window settled him.&nbsp; If the dear boy
dies, his death will be upon his father&rsquo;s head; for I&rsquo;m
sure we can&rsquo;t now pay to mend windows.&nbsp; We might though,
and do a good many more things too, if people didn&rsquo;t throw away
their five pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Tuesday the fire-insurance is due.&nbsp; I should like
to know how it&rsquo;s to be paid?&nbsp; Why, it can&rsquo;t be paid
at all!&nbsp; That five pounds would have more than done it - and now,
insurance is out of the question.&nbsp; And there never were so many
fires as there are now.&nbsp; I shall never close my eyes all night,
- but what&rsquo;s that to you, so people can call you liberal, Mr.
Caudle?&nbsp; Your wife and children may all be burnt alive in their
beds - as all of us to a certainty shall be, for the insurance <i>must</i>
drop.&nbsp; And after we&rsquo;ve insured for so many years!&nbsp; But
how, I should like to know, are people to insure who make ducks and
drakes of their five pounds?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think we might go to Margate this summer.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
poor little Caroline, I&rsquo;m sure she wants the sea.&nbsp; But no,
dear creature! she must stop at home - all of us must stop at home -
she&rsquo;ll go into a consumption, there&rsquo;s no doubt of that;
yes - sweet little angel! - I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to lose her,
<i>now</i>.&nbsp; The child might have been saved; but people can&rsquo;t
save their children and throw away their five pounds too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where poor little Mopsy is!&nbsp; While you were
lending that five pounds, the dog ran out of the shop.&nbsp; You know,
I never let it go into the street, for fear it should be bit by some
mad dog, and come home and bite all the children.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t
now at all astonish me if the animal was to come back with the hydrophobia,
and give it to all the family.&nbsp; However, what&rsquo;s your family
to you, so you can play the liberal creature with five pounds?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that shutter, how it&rsquo;s banging to and fro?&nbsp;
Yes, - I know what it wants as well as you; it wants a new fastening.&nbsp;
I was going to send for the blacksmith to-day, but now it&rsquo;s out
of the question: <i>now</i> it must bang of nights, since you&rsquo;ve
thrown away five pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! there&rsquo;s the soot falling down the chimney.&nbsp;
If I hate the smell of anything, it&rsquo;s the smell of soot.&nbsp;
And you know it; but what are my feelings to you?&nbsp; <i>Sweep the
chimney</i>!&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s all very fine to say sweep the chimney
- but how are chimneys to be swept - how are they to be paid for by
people who don&rsquo;t take care of their five pounds?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the mice running about the room?&nbsp; I hear
them.&nbsp; If they were to drag only you out of bed, it would be no
matter.&nbsp; <i>Set a trap for them</i>!&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s easy
enough to say - set a trap for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But how are people to
afford mouse-traps, when every day they lose five pounds?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a noise downstairs.&nbsp;
It wouldn&rsquo;t at all surprise me if there were thieves in the house.&nbsp;
Well, it <i>may</i> be the cat; but thieves are pretty sure to come
in some night.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a wretched fastening to the back-door;
but these are not times to afford bolts and bars, when people won&rsquo;t
take care of their five pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Anne ought to have gone to the dentist&rsquo;s to-morrow.&nbsp;
She wants three teeth taken out.&nbsp; Now, it can&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp;
Three teeth that quite disfigure the child&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; But
there they must stop, and spoil the sweetest face that was ever made.&nbsp;
Otherwise, she&rsquo;d have been a wife for a lord.&nbsp; Now, when
she grows up, who&rsquo;ll have her?&nbsp; Nobody.&nbsp; We shall die,
and leave her alone and unprotected in the world.&nbsp; But what do
you care for that?&nbsp; Nothing; so you can squander away five pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And thus</i>,&rdquo; comments Caudle, &ldquo;<i>according
to my wife</i>,<i> she - dear soul</i>!<i> - couldn&rsquo;t have a satin
gown - the girls couldn&rsquo;t have new bonnets</i> - <i>the water-rate
must stand over - Jack must get his death through a broken window -
our fire-insurance couldn&rsquo;t be paid</i>,<i> so that we should
all fall victims to the devouring element - we couldn&rsquo;t go to
Margate</i>,<i> and Caroline would go to an early grave - the dog would
come home and bite us all mad - the shutter would go banging for ever
- the soot would always fall - the mice never let us have a wink of
sleep - thieves be always breaking in the house - our dear Mary Anne
be for ever left an unprotected maid</i>,<i> - and with other evils
falling upon us</i>,<i> all</i>,<i> all because I would go on lending
five pounds</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE II - MR. CAUDLE HAS BEEN AT A TAVERN WITH A FRIEND, AND
IS &ldquo;ENOUGH TO POISON A WOMAN&rdquo; WITH TOBACCO-SMOKE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor me!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know
who&rsquo;d be a poor woman!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;d tie
themselves up to a man, if they knew only half they&rsquo;d have to
bear.&nbsp; A wife must stay at home, and be a drudge, whilst a man
can go anywhere.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enough for a wife to sit like Cinderella
by the ashes, whilst her husband can go drinking and singing at a tavern.&nbsp;
<i>You never sing</i>?&nbsp; How do I know you never sing?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very well for you to say so; but if I could hear you, I daresay you&rsquo;re
among the worst of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I suppose, it will be the tavern every night?&nbsp;
If you think I&rsquo;m going to sit up for you, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;re
very much mistaken.&nbsp; No: and I&rsquo;m not going to get out of
my warm bed to let you in, either.&nbsp; No: nor Susan shan&rsquo;t
sit up for you.&nbsp; No: nor you shan&rsquo;t have a latchkey.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to sleep with the door upon the latch, to be murdered
before the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&nbsp; Pah!&nbsp; Whewgh!&nbsp; That filthy tobacco-smoke!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s enough to kill any decent woman.&nbsp; You know I hate tobacco,
and yet you will do it.&nbsp; <i>You don&rsquo;t smoke yourself</i>?&nbsp;
What of that?&nbsp; If you go among people who <i>do</i> smoke, you&rsquo;re
just as bad, or worse.&nbsp; You might as well smoke - indeed, better.&nbsp;
Better smoke yourself than come home with other people&rsquo;s smoke
all in your hair and whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew any good come to a man who went to a tavern.&nbsp;
Nice companions he picks up there!&nbsp; Yes! people who make it a boast
to treat their wives like slaves, and ruin their families.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
that wretch Harry Prettyman.&nbsp; See what he&rsquo;s come to!&nbsp;
He doesn&rsquo;t get home now till two in the morning; and then in what
a state!&nbsp; He begins quarrelling with the door-mat, that his poor
wife may be afraid to speak to him.&nbsp; A mean wretch!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
you think I&rsquo;ll be like Mrs. Prettyman.&nbsp; No: I wouldn&rsquo;t
put up with it from the best man that ever trod.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
not make me afraid to speak to you, however you may swear at the door-mat.&nbsp;
No, Mr. Caudle, that you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t intend to stay out till two in the morning</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what you&rsquo;ll do when you get among such
people?&nbsp; Men can&rsquo;t answer for themselves when they get boozing
one with another.&nbsp; They never think of their poor wives, who are
grieving and wearing themselves out at home.&nbsp; A nice headache you&rsquo;ll
have to-morrow morning - or rather <i>this</i> morning; for it must
be past twelve.&nbsp; <i>You won&rsquo;t have a headache</i>?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very well for you to say so, but I know you will; and then
you may nurse yourself for me.&nbsp; Ha! that filthy tobacco again!&nbsp;
No; I shall not go to sleep like a good soul.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s people
to go to sleep when they&rsquo;re suffocated?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;ll be nice and ill in the morning!&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m going to let you have your breakfast
in bed, like Mrs. Prettyman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be such a fool.&nbsp;
No; nor I won&rsquo;t have discredit brought upon the house by sending
for soda-water early, for all the neighbourhood to say, &lsquo;Caudle
was drunk last night.&rsquo;&nbsp; No: I&rsquo;ve some regard for the
dear children, if you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No: nor you shan&rsquo;t
have broth for dinner.&nbsp; Not a neck of mutton crosses my threshold,
I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t want soda</i>,<i> and you won&rsquo;t want
broth</i>?&nbsp; All the better.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em
if you did, I can assure you. - Dear, dear, dear!&nbsp; That filthy
tobacco!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s enough to make me as bad as
you are.&nbsp; Talking about getting divorced, - I&rsquo;m sure tobacco
ought to be good grounds.&nbsp; How little does a woman think, when
she marries, that she gives herself up to be poisoned!&nbsp; You men
contrive to have it all of your own side, you do.&nbsp; Now if I was
to go and leave you and the children, a pretty noise there&rsquo;d be!&nbsp;
You, however, can go and smoke no end of pipes and - <i>You didn&rsquo;t
smoke</i>?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all the same, Mr. Caudle, if you go among
smoking people.&nbsp; Folks are known by their company.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
better smoke yourself, than bring home the pipes of all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see how it will be.&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;ve once gone
to a tavern, you&rsquo;ll always be going.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be coming
home tipsy every night; and tumbling down and breaking your leg, and
putting out your shoulder; and bringing all sorts of disgrace and expense
upon us.&nbsp; And then you&rsquo;ll be getting into a street fight
- oh!&nbsp; I know your temper too well to doubt it, Mr. Caudle - and
be knocking down some of the police.&nbsp; And then I know what will
follow.&nbsp; It <i>must</i> follow.&nbsp; Yes, you&rsquo;ll be sent
for a month or six weeks to the treadmill.&nbsp; Pretty thing that,
for a respectable tradesman, Mr. Caudle, to be put upon the treadmill
with all sorts of thieves and vagabonds, and - there, again, that horrible
tobacco! - and riffraff of every kind.&nbsp; I should like to know how
your children are to hold up their heads, after their father has been
upon the treadmill? - No; I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> go to sleep.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m not talking of what&rsquo;s impossible.&nbsp; I know it will
all happen - every bit of it.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for the dear
children, you might be ruined and I wouldn&rsquo;t so much as speak
about it, but - oh, dear, dear! at least you might go where they smoke
<i>good</i> tobacco - but I can&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;m their
mother.&nbsp; At least, they shall have <i>one</i> parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taverns!&nbsp; Never did a man go to a tavern who didn&rsquo;t
die a beggar.&nbsp; And how your pot-companions will laugh at you when
they see your name in the Gazette!&nbsp; For it <i>must</i> happen.&nbsp;
Your business is sure to fall off; for what respectable people will
buy toys for their children of a drunkard?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not a
drunkard!&nbsp; No: but you will be - it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve begun by staying out till midnight.&nbsp; By-and-by
&rsquo;twill be all night.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you think, Mr. Caudle,
you shall ever have a key.&nbsp; I know you.&nbsp; Yes; you&rsquo;d
do exactly like that Prettyman, and what did he do, only last Wednesday?&nbsp;
Why, he let himself in about four in the morning, and brought home with
him his pot-companion, Puffy.&nbsp; His dear wife woke at six, and saw
Prettyman&rsquo;s dirty boots at her bedside.&nbsp; And where was the
wretch, her husband?&nbsp; Why, he was drinking downstairs - swilling.&nbsp;
Yes; worse than a midnight robber, he&rsquo;d taken the keys out of
his dear wife&rsquo;s pockets - ha! what that poor creature has to bear!
- and had got at the brandy.&nbsp; A pretty thing for a wife to wake
at six in the morning, and instead of her husband to see his dirty boots!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not be made your victim, Mr. Caudle, not I.&nbsp;
You shall never get at my keys, for they shall lie under my pillow -
under my own head, Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be ruined, but if I can help it, you shall ruin
nobody but yourself.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III - MR. CAUDLE JOINS A CLUB - &ldquo;THE SKYLARKS.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if a woman hadn&rsquo;t better be in her grave than
be married!&nbsp; That is, if she can&rsquo;t be married to a decent
man.&nbsp; No; I don&rsquo;t care if you are tired, I <i>shan&rsquo;t</i>
let you go to sleep.&nbsp; No, and I won&rsquo;t say what I have to
say in the morning; I&rsquo;ll say it now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very
well for you to come home at what time you like - it&rsquo;s now half-past
twelve - and expect I&rsquo;m to hold my tongue, and let you go to sleep.&nbsp;
What next, I wonder?&nbsp; A woman had better be sold for a slave at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;ve gone and joined a club?&nbsp; The Skylarks,
indeed!&nbsp; A pretty skylark you&rsquo;ll make of yourself!&nbsp;
But I won&rsquo;t stay and be ruined by you.&nbsp; No: I&rsquo;m determined
on that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go and take the dear children, and you may
get who you like to keep your house.&nbsp; That is, as long as you have
a house to keep - and that won&rsquo;t be long, I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How any decent man can go and spend his nights in a tavern!
- oh, yes, Mr. Caudle; I daresay you <i>do</i> go for rational conversation.&nbsp;
I should like to know how many of you would care for what you call rational
conversation, if you had it without your filthy brandy-and-water; yes,
and your more filthy tobacco-smoke.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the last time
you came home, I had the headache for a week.&nbsp; But I know who it
is who&rsquo;s taking you to destruction.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that brute,
Prettyman.&nbsp; He has broken his own poor wife&rsquo;s heart, and
now he wants to - but don&rsquo;t you think it, Mr. Caudle; I&rsquo;ll
not have my peace of mind destroyed by the best man that ever trod.&nbsp;
Oh, yes!&nbsp; I know you don&rsquo;t care so long as you can appear
well to all the world, - but the world little thinks how you behave
to me.&nbsp; It shall know it, though - that I&rsquo;m determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How any man can leave his own happy fireside to go and sit,
and smoke, and drink, and talk with people who wouldn&rsquo;t one of
&rsquo;em lift a finger to save him from hanging - how any man can leave
his wife - and a good wife, too, though I say it - for a parcel of pot-companions
- oh, it&rsquo;s disgraceful, Mr. Caudle; it&rsquo;s unfeeling.&nbsp;
No man who had the least love for his wife could do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose this is to be the case every Saturday?&nbsp;
But I know what I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; I know - it&rsquo;s no use, Mr.
Caudle, your calling me a good creature: I&rsquo;m not such a fool as
to be coaxed in that way.&nbsp; No; if you want to go to sleep, you
should come home in Christian time, not at half-past twelve.&nbsp; There
was a time, when you were as regular at your fireside as the kettle.&nbsp;
That was when you were a decent man, and didn&rsquo;t go amongst Heaven
knows who, drinking and smoking, and making what you think your jokes.&nbsp;
I never heard any good come to a man who cared about jokes.&nbsp; No
respectable tradesman does.&nbsp; But I know what I&rsquo;ll do: I&rsquo;ll
scare away your Skylarks.&nbsp; The house serves liquor after twelve
of a Saturday; and if I don&rsquo;t write to the magistrates, and have
the licence taken away, I&rsquo;m not lying in this bed this night.&nbsp;
Yes, you may call me a foolish woman; but no, Mr. Caudle, no; it&rsquo;s
you who are the foolish man; or worse than a foolish man; you&rsquo;re
a wicked one.&nbsp; If you were to die to-morrow - and people who go
to public-houses do all they can to shorten their lives - I should like
to know who would write upon your tombstone, &lsquo;A tender husband
and an affectionate father&rsquo;?&nbsp; <i>I</i> - I&rsquo;d have no
such falsehoods told of you, I can assure you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going and spending your money, and - nonsense! don&rsquo;t
tell me - no, if you were ten times to swear it, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe
that you only spent eighteenpence on a Saturday.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
be all those hours and only spend eighteenpence.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not quite a fool, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; A great deal you could
have for eighteenpence!&nbsp; And all the Club married men and fathers
of families.&nbsp; The more shame for &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Skylarks, indeed!&nbsp;
They should call themselves Vultures; for they can only do as they do
by eating up their innocent wives and children.&nbsp; Eighteenpence
a week!&nbsp; And if it was only that, - do you know what fifty-two
eighteenpences come to in a year?&nbsp; Do you ever think of that, and
see the gowns I wear?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t, out of the
house-money, buy myself a pin-cushion; though I&rsquo;ve wanted one
these six months.&nbsp; No - not so much as a ball of cotton.&nbsp;
But what do you care so you can get your brandy-and-water?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
the girls, too - the things they want!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re never dressed
like other people&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all the same
to their father.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; So he can go with his Skylarks
they may wear sackcloth for pinafores, and packthread for garters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not let that Mr. Prettyman come here, that&rsquo;s
all; or, rather, you&rsquo;d better bring him once.&nbsp; Yes, I should
like to see him.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t forget it.&nbsp; A man who,
I may say, lives and moves only in a spittoon.&nbsp; A man who has a
pipe in his mouth as constant as his front teeth.&nbsp; A sort of tavern
king, with a lot of fools like you to laugh at what he thinks his jokes,
and give him consequence.&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle, no; it&rsquo;s no use
your telling me to go to sleep, for I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Go to sleep,
indeed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s almost time to get up.&nbsp;
I hardly know what&rsquo;s the use of coming to bed at all now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Skylarks, indeed!&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ll be buying
a &lsquo;Little Warbler,&rsquo; and at your time of life, be trying
to sing.&nbsp; The peacocks will sing next.&nbsp; A pretty name you&rsquo;ll
get in the neighbourhood; and, in a very little time, a nice face you&rsquo;ll
have.&nbsp; Your nose is getting redder already: and you&rsquo;ve just
one of the noses that liquor always flies to.&nbsp; <i>You don&rsquo;t
see it&rsquo;s red</i>?&nbsp; No - I daresay not - but <i>I</i> see
it; <i>I</i> see a great many things you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And so you&rsquo;ll
go on.&nbsp; In a little time, with your brandy-and-water - don&rsquo;t
tell me that you only take two small glasses: I know what men&rsquo;s
two small glasses are; in a little time you&rsquo;ll have a face all
over as if it was made of red currant jam.&nbsp; And I should like to
know who&rsquo;s to endure you then?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t, and so don&rsquo;t
think it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t come to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice habits men learn at clubs!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Joskins:
he was a decent creature once, and now I&rsquo;m told he has more than
once boxed his wife&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a Skylark too.&nbsp;
And I suppose, some day, you&rsquo;ll be trying to box <i>my</i> ears?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t attempt it, Mr. Caudle; I say don&rsquo;t attempt it.&nbsp;
Yes - it&rsquo;s all very well for you to say you don&rsquo;t mean it,
- but I only say again, don&rsquo;t attempt it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d rue
it till the day of your death, Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going and sitting for four hours at a tavern!&nbsp; What men,
unless they had their wives with them, can find to talk about, I can&rsquo;t
think.&nbsp; No good, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteenpence a week - and drinking brandy-and-water, enough
to swim a boat!&nbsp; And smoking like the funnel of a steamship!&nbsp;
And I can&rsquo;t afford myself so much as a piece of tape!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
brutal, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ve-ve-ve - ry bru - tal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And here</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle - &ldquo;<i>Here</i>,<i>
thank Heaven</i>!<i> at last she fell asleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE IV - MR. CAUDLE HAS BEEN CALLED FROM HIS BED TO BAIL MR.
PRETTYMAN FROM THE WATCH-HOUSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, Mr. Caudle, I knew it would come to this.&nbsp; I said
it would, when you joined those precious Skylarks.&nbsp; People being
called out of their beds at all hours of the night, to bail a set of
fellows who are never so happy as when they&rsquo;re leading sober men
to destruction.&nbsp; I should like to know what the neighbours will
think of you, with people from the police knocking at the door at two
in the morning?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me that the man has been ill-used:
he&rsquo;s not the man to be ill-used.&nbsp; And you must go and bail
him!&nbsp; I know the end of that: he&rsquo;ll run away, and you&rsquo;ll
have to pay the money.&nbsp; I should like to know what&rsquo;s the
use of my working and slaving to save a farthing, when you throw away
pounds upon your precious Skylarks.&nbsp; A pretty cold you&rsquo;ll
have to-morrow morning, being called out of your warm bed this weather;
but don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ll nurse you - not I; not a drop of
gruel do you get from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve plenty of ways of spending your
money - not throwing it away upon a set of dissolute peace-breakers.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all very well for you to say you haven&rsquo;t thrown away
your money, but you will.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be certain to run off; it
isn&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;ll go upon his trial, and you&rsquo;ll be
fixed with the bail.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s no trial
in the matter, because I know there is; it&rsquo;s for something more
than quarrelling with the policeman that he was locked up.&nbsp; People
aren&rsquo;t locked up for that.&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s for robbery, or
something worse, perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you have bailed him, people will think you are as bad
as he is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me you couldn&rsquo;t help bailing
him; you should have shown yourself a respectable man, and have let
him been sent to prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now people know you&rsquo;re the friend of drunken and disorderly
persons, you&rsquo;ll never have a night&rsquo;s sleep in your bed.&nbsp;
Not that it would matter what fell upon you, if it wasn&rsquo;t your
poor wife who suffered.&nbsp; Of course all the business will be in
the newspapers, and your name with it.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,
too, if they give your picture as they do the other folks of the Old
Bailey.&nbsp; A pretty thing that, to go down to your children.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure it will be enough to make them change their name.&nbsp;
No, I shall not go to sleep; it&rsquo;s all very well for you to say,
go to sleep, after such a disturbance.&nbsp; But I shall not go to sleep,
Mr. Caudle; certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Her will</i>,<i> I have no doubt</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle,
&ldquo;<i>was strong</i>; <i>but nature was stronger</i>,<i> and she
did sleep; this night inflicting upon me a remarkably short lecture</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE V - MR. CAUDLE HAS REMAINED DOWNSTAIRS TILL PAST ONE, WITH
A FRIEND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty time of night to come to bed, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp;
As cold, too, as any ice.&nbsp; Enough to give any woman her death,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shouldn&rsquo;t have locked up the coals</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve no doubt the fellow would have
stayed all night.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very well for you, Mr. Caudle,
to bring people home - but I wish you&rsquo;d think first what&rsquo;s
for supper.&nbsp; That beautiful leg of pork would have served for our
dinner to-morrow, - and now it&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t
keep the house upon the money, and I won&rsquo;t pretend to do it, if
you bring a mob of people every night to clear out the cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;ll be so ready to give you a supper when
you want one: for want one you will, unless you change your plans.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me!&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;m right.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
first be eaten up, and then you&rsquo;ll be laughed at.&nbsp; I know
the world.&nbsp; No, indeed, Mr. Caudle, I don&rsquo;t think ill of
everybody; don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t see a leg of
pork eaten up in that way, without asking myself what it&rsquo;s all
to end in if such things go on?&nbsp; And then he must have pickles,
too!&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t be content with my cabbage - no, Mr. Caudle,
I won&rsquo;t let you go to sleep.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very well for you
to say let you go to sleep, after you&rsquo;ve kept me awake till this
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did I keep awake</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose I could go to sleep when I knew that man
was below drinking up your substance in brandy-and-water? for he couldn&rsquo;t
be content upon decent, wholesome gin.&nbsp; Upon my word, you ought
to be a rich man, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; You have such very fine friends,
I wonder who gives you brandy when you go out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, he couldn&rsquo;t be content with my pickled cabbage
- and I should like to know who makes better - but he must have walnuts.&nbsp;
And you, too, like a fool - now, don&rsquo;t you think to stop me, Mr.
Caudle; a poor woman may be trampled to death, and never say a word
- you, too, like a fool - I wonder who&rsquo;d do it for you - to insist
upon the girl going out for pickled walnuts.&nbsp; And in such a night
too!&nbsp; With snow upon the ground.&nbsp; Yes; you&rsquo;re a man
of fine feelings, you are, Mr. Caudle; but the world doesn&rsquo;t know
you as I know you - fine feelings, indeed! to send the poor girl out,
when I told you and told your friend, too - a pretty brute he is, I&rsquo;m
sure - that the poor girl had got a cold and I dare say chilblains on
her toes.&nbsp; But I know what will be the end of that; she&rsquo;ll
be laid up, and we shall have a nice doctor&rsquo;s bill.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;ll pay it, I can tell you - for <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You wish you were out of the world</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, that&rsquo;s all very easy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
<i>I</i> might wish it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t swear in that dreadful way!&nbsp;
Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that the bed will open and swallow you?&nbsp;
And don&rsquo;t swing about in that way.&nbsp; <i>That</i> will do no
good.&nbsp; <i>That</i> won&rsquo;t bring back the leg of pork, and
the brandy you&rsquo;ve poured down both of your throats.&nbsp; Oh,
I know it, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&nbsp; I only recollected it when I&rsquo;d
got into bed - and if it hadn&rsquo;t been so cold, you&rsquo;d have
seen me downstairs again, I can tell you - I recollected it, and a pretty
two hours I&rsquo;ve passed - that I left the key in the cupboard, -
and I know it - I could see by the manner of you when you came into
the room - I know you&rsquo;ve got at the other bottle.&nbsp; However,
there&rsquo;s one comfort: you told me to send for the best brandy -
the very best - for your other friend, who called last Wednesday.&nbsp;
Ha! ha!&nbsp; It was British - the cheapest British - and nice and ill
I hope the pair of you will be to-morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only the bare bone of the leg of pork! but you&rsquo;ll
get nothing else for dinner, I can tell you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dreadful
thing that the poor children should go without, - but if they have such
a father, they, poor things, must suffer for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a whole leg of pork and a pint of brandy!&nbsp; A pint
of brandy and a leg of pork.&nbsp; A leg of - leg - leg - pint - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And mumbling the syllables</i>,&rdquo; says Mr. Caudle&rsquo;s
MS., &ldquo;<i>she went to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE VI - MR. CAUDLE HAS LENT AN ACQUAINTANCE THE FAMILY UMBRELLA</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the third umbrella gone since Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What were you to do</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, let him go home in the rain, to be sure.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
very certain there was nothing about <i>him</i> that could spoil.&nbsp;
Take cold, indeed!&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t look like one of the sort
to take cold.&nbsp; Besides, he&rsquo;d have better taken cold than
take our only umbrella.&nbsp; Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp;
I say, do you hear the rain?&nbsp; And as I&rsquo;m alive, if it isn&rsquo;t
St. Swithin&rsquo;s day!&nbsp; Do you hear it against the windows?&nbsp;
Nonsense; you don&rsquo;t impose upon me.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t be asleep
with such a shower as that!&nbsp; Do you hear it, I say?&nbsp; Oh, you
<i>do</i> hear it!&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s a pretty flood, I think,
to last for six weeks; and no stirring all the time out of the house.&nbsp;
Pooh! don&rsquo;t think me a fool, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t insult
me.&nbsp; <i>He</i> return the umbrella!&nbsp; Anybody would think you
were born yesterday.&nbsp; As if anybody ever <i>did</i> return an umbrella!&nbsp;
There - do you hear it!&nbsp; Worse and worse!&nbsp; Cats and dogs,
and for six weeks, always six weeks.&nbsp; And no umbrella!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know how the children are to go to school
to-morrow?&nbsp; They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go through such weather, I&rsquo;m
determined.&nbsp; No: they shall stop at home and never learn anything
- the blessed creatures! - sooner than go and get wet.&nbsp; And when
they grow up, I wonder who they&rsquo;ll have to thank for knowing nothing
- who, indeed, but their father?&nbsp; People who can&rsquo;t feel for
their own children ought never to be fathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know why you lent the umbrella.&nbsp; Oh, yes; I know
very well.&nbsp; I was going out to tea at dear mother&rsquo;s to-morrow
- you knew that; and you did it on purpose.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me;
you hate me to go there, and take every mean advantage to hinder me.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t you think it, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; No, sir; if it comes
down in buckets-full I&rsquo;ll go all the more.&nbsp; No: and I won&rsquo;t
have a cab.&nbsp; Where do you think the money&rsquo;s to come from?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got nice high notions at that club of yours.&nbsp; A cab,
indeed!&nbsp; Cost me sixteenpence at least - sixteenpence! two-and-eightpence,
for there&rsquo;s back again.&nbsp; Cabs, indeed!&nbsp; I should like
to know who&rsquo;s to pay for &rsquo;em; <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t pay for
&rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t, if you go on as you do;
throwing away your property, and beggaring your children - buying umbrellas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; I say, do you hear
it?&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care - I&rsquo;ll go to mother&rsquo;s to-morrow:
I will; and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll walk every step of the way,
- and you know that will give me my death.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t call me
a foolish woman, it&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s the foolish man.&nbsp;
You know I can&rsquo;t wear clogs; and with no umbrella, the wet&rsquo;s
sure to give me a cold - it always does.&nbsp; But what do you care
for that?&nbsp; Nothing at all.&nbsp; I may be laid up for what you
care, as I daresay I shall - and a pretty doctor&rsquo;s bill there&rsquo;ll
be.&nbsp; I hope there will!&nbsp; It will teach you to lend your umbrellas
again.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I caught my death; yes: and
that&rsquo;s what you lent the umbrella for.&nbsp; Of course!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice clothes I shall get too, trapesing through weather like
this.&nbsp; My gown and bonnet will be spoilt quite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Needn&rsquo;t I wear &rsquo;em then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Caudle, I <i>shall</i> wear &rsquo;em.&nbsp; No,
sir, I&rsquo;m not going out a dowdy to please you or anybody else.&nbsp;
Gracious knows! it isn&rsquo;t often that I step over the threshold;
indeed, I might as well be a slave at once, - better, I should say.&nbsp;
But when I do go out, - Mr. Caudle, I choose to go like a lady.&nbsp;
Oh! that rain - if it isn&rsquo;t enough to break in the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&nbsp; I do look forward with dread for to-morrow!&nbsp;
How I am to go to mother&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;
But if I die I&rsquo;ll do it.&nbsp; No, sir; I won&rsquo;t borrow an
umbrella.&nbsp; No; and you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t buy one.&nbsp; Now,
Mr. Caudle, only listen to this: if you bring home another umbrella,
I&rsquo;ll throw it in the street.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have my own umbrella
or none at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! and it was only last week I had a new nozzle put to that
umbrella.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, if I&rsquo;d have known as much as I
do now, it might have gone without one for me.&nbsp; Paying for new
nozzles, for other people to laugh at you.&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s all
very well for you - you can go to sleep.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no thought
of your poor patient wife, and your own dear children.&nbsp; You think
of nothing but lending umbrellas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, indeed! - call themselves lords of the creation! - pretty
lords, when they can&rsquo;t even take care of an umbrella!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that walk to-morrow will be the death of me.&nbsp;
But that&rsquo;s what you want - then you may go to your club and do
as you like - and then, nicely my poor dear children will be used -
but then, sir, then you&rsquo;ll be happy.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t tell
me!&nbsp; I know you will.&nbsp; Else you&rsquo;d never have lent the
umbrella!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to go on Thursday about that summons and, of course,
you can&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; No, indeed, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> go without
the umbrella.&nbsp; You may lose the debt for what I care - it won&rsquo;t
be so much as spoiling your clothes - better lose it: people deserve
to lose debts who lend umbrellas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should like to know how I&rsquo;m to go to mother&rsquo;s
without the umbrella!&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me that I said I <i>would</i>
go - that&rsquo;s nothing to do with it; nothing at all.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
think I&rsquo;m neglecting her, and the little money we were to have
we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have at all - because we&rsquo;ve no umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children, too!&nbsp; Dear things!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
be sopping wet; for they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stop at home - they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
lose their learning; it&rsquo;s all their father will leave &rsquo;em,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; But they <i>shall</i> go to school.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell me I said they shouldn&rsquo;t: you are so aggravating, Caudle;
you&rsquo;d spoil the temper of an angel.&nbsp; They <i>shall</i> go
to school; mark that.&nbsp; And if they get their deaths of cold, it&rsquo;s
not my fault - I didn&rsquo;t lend the umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>At length</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I fell asleep;
and dreamt that the sky was turned into green calico</i>,<i> with whalebone
ribs; that</i>,<i> in fact</i>,<i> the whole world turned round under
a tremendous umbrella</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE VII - MR. CAUDLE HAS VENTURED A REMONSTRANCE ON HIS DAY&rsquo;S
DINNER: COLD MUTTON, AND NO PUDDING. - MRS. CAUDLE DEFENDS THE COLD
SHOULDER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I wonder what
it will be next?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing proper, now - nothing at
all.&nbsp; Better get somebody else to keep the house, I think.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t do it now, it seems; I&rsquo;m only in the way here: I&rsquo;d
better take the children, and go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I grumbling about now?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very well
for you to ask that!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d better be out of
the world than - there now, Mr. Caudle; there you are again!&nbsp; I
<i>shall</i> speak, sir.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often I open my mouth,
Heaven knows!&nbsp; But you like to hear nobody talk but yourself.&nbsp;
You ought to have married a negro slave, and not any respectable woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to go about the house looking like thunder all
the day, and I&rsquo;m not to say a word.&nbsp; Where do you think pudding&rsquo;s
to come from every day?&nbsp; You show a nice example to your children,
you do; complaining, and turning your nose up at a sweet piece of cold
mutton, because there&rsquo;s no pudding!&nbsp; You go a nice way to
make &rsquo;em extravagant - teach &rsquo;em nice lessons to begin the
world with.&nbsp; Do you know what puddings cost; or do you think they
fly in at the window?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hate cold mutton.&nbsp; The more shame for you, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve the stomach of a lord, you have.&nbsp; No,
sir: I didn&rsquo;t choose to hash the mutton.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
easy for you to say hash it; but <i>I</i> know what a joint loses in
hashing: it&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s dinner the less, if it&rsquo;s a bit.&nbsp;
Yes, I daresay; other people may have puddings with cold mutton.&nbsp;
No doubt of it; and other people become bankrupts.&nbsp; But if ever
you get into the Gazette, it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be <i>my</i> fault
- no; I&rsquo;ll do my duty as a wife to you, Mr. Caudle: you shall
never have it to say that it was <i>my</i> housekeeping that brought
you to beggary.&nbsp; No; you may sulk at the cold meat - ha! I hope
you&rsquo;ll never live to want such a piece of cold mutton as we had
to-day! and you may threaten to go to a tavern to dine; but, with our
present means, not a crumb of pudding do you get from me.&nbsp; You
shall have nothing but the cold joint - nothing as I&rsquo;m a Christian
sinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there you are, throwing those fowls in my face again!&nbsp;
I know you once brought home a pair of fowls; I know it: and weren&rsquo;t
you mean enough to want to stop &rsquo;em out of my week&rsquo;s money?&nbsp;
Oh, the selfishness - the shabbiness of men!&nbsp; They can go out and
throw away pounds upon pounds with a pack of people who laugh at &rsquo;em
afterwards; but if it&rsquo;s anything wanted for their own homes, their
poor wives may hunt for it.&nbsp; I wonder you don&rsquo;t blush to
name those fowls again!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be so little for the
world, Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Going to get up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make yourself ridiculous, Mr. Caudle; I can&rsquo;t
say a word to you like any other wife, but you must threaten to get
up.&nbsp; <i>Do</i> be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puddings, indeed!&nbsp; Do you think I&rsquo;m made of puddings?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you have some boiled rice three weeks ago?&nbsp; Besides,
is this the time of the year for puddings?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very
well if I had money enough allowed me like any other wife to keep the
house with: then, indeed, I might have preserves like any other woman;
now, it&rsquo;s impossible; and it&rsquo;s cruel - yes, Mr. Caudle,
cruel - of you to expect it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Apples aren&rsquo;t so dear</i>,<i> are they</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what apples are, Mr. Caudle, without your telling me.&nbsp;
But I suppose you want something more than apples for dumplings?&nbsp;
I suppose sugar costs something, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
how it is.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how one expense brings on another, and
that&rsquo;s how people go to ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pancakes</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of your lying muttering there about pancakes?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you always have &rsquo;em once a year - every Shrove Tuesday?&nbsp;
And what would any moderate, decent man want more?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pancakes, indeed!&nbsp; Pray, Mr. Caudle, - no, it&rsquo;s
no use your saying fine words to me to let you go to sleep; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!
- pray do you know the price of eggs just now?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not
an egg you can trust to under seven and eight a shilling; well, you&rsquo;ve
only just to reckon up how many eggs - don&rsquo;t lie swearing there
at the eggs in that manner, Mr. Caudle; unless you expect the bed to
let you fall through.&nbsp; You call yourself a respectable tradesman,
I suppose?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I only wish people knew you as well as I
do!&nbsp; Swearing at eggs, indeed!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m tired of this
usage, Mr. Caudle; quite tired of it; and I don&rsquo;t care how soon
it&rsquo;s ended!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I do nothing but work and labour, and think
how to make the most of everything; and this is how I&rsquo;m rewarded.&nbsp;
I should like to see anybody whose joints go further than mine.&nbsp;
But if I was to throw away your money into the street, or lay it out
in fine feathers on myself, I should be better thought of.&nbsp; The
woman who studies her husband and her family is always made a drudge
of.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your fine fal-lal wives who&rsquo;ve the best time
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of your lying groaning there in that
manner?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t make me hold my tongue, I can tell you.&nbsp;
You think to have it all your own way - but you won&rsquo;t, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp;
You can insult my dinner; look like a demon, I may say, at a wholesome
piece of cold mutton - ah! the thousands of far better creatures than
you are who&rsquo;d been thankful for that mutton! - and I&rsquo;m never
to speak!&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re mistaken - I will.&nbsp; Your usage
of me, Mr. Caudle, is infamous - unworthy of a man.&nbsp; I only wish
people knew you for what you are; but I&rsquo;ve told you again and
again they shall some day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puddings!&nbsp; And now I suppose I shall hear of nothing
but puddings!&nbsp; Yes, and I know what it would end in.&nbsp; First,
you&rsquo;d have a pudding every day - oh, I know your extravagance
- then you&rsquo;d go for fish, - then I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you&rsquo;d
have soup; turtle, no doubt: then you&rsquo;d go for a dessert; and
- oh! I see it all as plain as the quilt before me - but no, not while
I&rsquo;m alive!&nbsp; What your second wife may do I don&rsquo;t know;
perhaps <i>she&rsquo;ll</i> be a fine lady; but you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
be ruined by me, Mr. Caudle; that I&rsquo;m determined.&nbsp; Puddings,
indeed!&nbsp; Pu-dding-s!&nbsp; Pud - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Exhausted nature</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>could
hold out no longer.&nbsp; She went to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE VIII - CAUDLE HAS BEEN MADE A MASON - MRS. CAUDLE INDIGNANT
AND CURIOUS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Caudle - Mr. Caudle, I say: oh: you can&rsquo;t be
asleep already, I know now, what I mean to say is this; there&rsquo;s
no use, none at all, in our having any disturbance about the matter;
but, at last my mind&rsquo;s made up, Mr. Caudle; I shall leave you.&nbsp;
Either I know all you&rsquo;ve been doing to-night, or to-morrow morning
I quit the house.&nbsp; No, no; there&rsquo;s an end of the marriage
state, I think - an end of all confidence between man and wife - if
a husband&rsquo;s to have secrets and keep &rsquo;em all to himself.&nbsp;
Pretty secrets they must be, when his own wife can&rsquo;t know &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
Not fit for any decent person to know, I&rsquo;m sure, if that&rsquo;s
the case.&nbsp; Now, Caudle, don&rsquo;t let us quarrel, there&rsquo;s
a good soul, tell me what it&rsquo;s all about?&nbsp; A pack of nonsense,
I dare say; still - not that I care much about it, - still I <i>should</i>
like to know.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a dear.&nbsp; Eh: oh, don&rsquo;t
tell me there&rsquo;s nothing in it: I know better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not a fool, Mr. Caudle: I know there&rsquo;s a good deal in it.&nbsp;
Now, Caudle, just tell me a little bit of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d
tell you anything.&nbsp; You know I would.&nbsp; Well?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, you&rsquo;re enough to vex a saint!&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t
you think you&rsquo;re going to sleep; because you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp;
Do you suppose I&rsquo;d ever suffered you to go and be made a mason,
if I didn&rsquo;t suppose I was to know the secret too?&nbsp; Not that
it&rsquo;s anything to know, I dare say; and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
determined to know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what it is; oh yes, there can be no doubt.&nbsp;
The secret is, to ill-use poor women; to tyrannise over &rsquo;em; to
make &rsquo;em your slaves: especially your wives.&nbsp; It must be
something of the sort, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed to have it known.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s right and proper never need be done in secret.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
an insult to a woman for a man to be a freemason, and let his wife know
nothing of it.&nbsp; But, poor soul! she&rsquo;s sure to know it somehow
- for nice husbands they all make.&nbsp; Yes, yes; a part of the secret
is to think better of all the world than their own wives and families.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure men have quite enough to care for - that is, if they
act properly - to care for them they have at home.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t
have much care to spare for the world besides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose they call you <i>Brother</i> Caudle?&nbsp; A
pretty brother, indeed!&nbsp; Going and dressing yourself up in an apron
like a turnpike man - for that&rsquo;s what you look like.&nbsp; And
I should like to know what the apron&rsquo;s for?&nbsp; There must be
something in it not very respectable, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Well, I
only wish I was Queen for a day or two.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d put an end to
freemasonry, and all such trumpery, I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, come, Caudle; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel.&nbsp;
Eh!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not in pain, dear?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s it all
about?&nbsp; What are you lying laughing there at?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
a fool to trouble my head about you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not going to let me know the secret, eh?&nbsp;
You mean to say, - you&rsquo;re not?&nbsp; Now, Caudle, you know it&rsquo;s
a hard matter to put me in a passion - not that I care about the secret
itself: no, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a button to know it, for it&rsquo;s
all nonsense, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t the secret I care
about: it&rsquo;s the slight, Mr. Caudle; it&rsquo;s the studied insult
that a man pays to his wife, when he thinks of going through the world
keeping something to himself which he won&rsquo;t let her know.&nbsp;
Man and wife one, indeed!&nbsp; I should like to know how that can be
when a man&rsquo;s a mason - when he keeps a secret that sets him and
his wife apart?&nbsp; Ha, you men make the laws, and so you take good
care to have all the best of &rsquo;em to yourselves: otherwise a woman
ought to be allowed a divorce when a man becomes a mason: when he&rsquo;s
got a sort of corner-cupboard in his heart - a secret place in his mind
- that his poor wife isn&rsquo;t allowed to rummage!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t close your eyes for a week
- no, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t - unless you tell me some of it.&nbsp;
Come, there&rsquo;s a good creature; there&rsquo;s a love.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure, Caudle, I wouldn&rsquo;t refuse you anything - and you know it,
or ought to know it by this time.&nbsp; I only wish I had a secret!&nbsp;
To whom should I think of confiding it, but to my dear husband?&nbsp;
I should be miserable to keep it to myself, and you know it.&nbsp; Now
Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever such a man?&nbsp; A man, indeed!&nbsp; A brute!
- yes, Mr. Caudle, an unfeeling, brutal creature, when you might oblige
me, and you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t object to
your being a mason: not at all, Caudle; I dare say it&rsquo;s a very
good thing; I dare say it is - it&rsquo;s only your making a secret
of it that vexes me.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll tell me - you&rsquo;ll tell
your own Margaret?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a wretch,
Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know why: oh, yes, I can tell.&nbsp; The fact is, you&rsquo;re
ashamed to let me know what a fool they&rsquo;ve been making of you.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; You, at your time of life - the father of a family!&nbsp;
I should be ashamed of myself, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;ll be going to what you call your
Lodge every night, now.&nbsp; Lodge, indeed!&nbsp; Pretty place it must
be, where they don&rsquo;t admit women.&nbsp; Nice goings on, I dare
say.&nbsp; Then you call one another brethren.&nbsp; Brethren!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d relations enough, you didn&rsquo;t want any
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what all this masonry&rsquo;s about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
only an excuse to get away from your wives and families, that you may
feast and drink together, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the secret.&nbsp;
And to abuse women, - as if they were inferior animals, and not to be
trusted.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the secret; and nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, don&rsquo;t let us quarrel.&nbsp; Yes, I know
you&rsquo;re in pain.&nbsp; Still, Caudle, my love; Caudle!&nbsp; Dearest,
I say!&nbsp; Caudle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I recollect nothing more</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>for
I had eaten a hearty supper</i>,<i> and somehow became oblivious</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE IX - MR. CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO GREENWICH FAIR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Mr. Caudle: I hope you enjoyed yourself at Greenwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How do I know you&rsquo;ve been at Greenwich</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it very well, sir: know all about it: know more than
you think I know.&nbsp; I thought there was something in the wind.&nbsp;
Yes, I was sure of it, when you went out of the house to-day.&nbsp;
I knew it by the looks of you, though I didn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp;
Upon my word!&nbsp; And you call yourself a respectable man, and the
father of a family!&nbsp; Going to a fair among all sorts of people,
- at your time of life.&nbsp; Yes; and never think of taking your wife
with you.&nbsp; Oh no! you can go and enjoy yourself out, with I don&rsquo;t
know who: go out, and make yourself very pleasant, I dare say.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me; I hear what a nice companion Mr. Caudle is: what
a good-tempered person.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I only wish people could see
you at home, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But so it is with men.&nbsp; They
can keep all their good temper for out-of-doors - their wives never
see any of it.&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know
who&rsquo;d be a poor woman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, I&rsquo;m not in an ill-temper; not at all.&nbsp;
I know I used to be a fool when we were first married: I used to worry
and fret myself to death when you went out; but I&rsquo;ve got over
that.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t put myself out of the way now for the best
man that ever trod.&nbsp; For what thanks does a poor woman get?&nbsp;
None at all.&nbsp; No: it&rsquo;s those who don&rsquo;t care for their
families who are the best thought of.&nbsp; I only wish I could bring
myself not to care for mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why couldn&rsquo;t you say, like a man, you were going
to Greenwich Fair when you went out?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use your saying
that, Mr. Caudle: don&rsquo;t tell me that you didn&rsquo;t think of
going; you&rsquo;d made up your mind to it, and you know it.&nbsp; Pretty
games you&rsquo;ve had, no doubt!&nbsp; I should like to have been behind
you, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; A man at your time of life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, of course, I never want to go out.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp;
I may stay at home with the cat.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t think of taking
your wife and children, like any other decent man, to a fair.&nbsp;
Oh no, you never care to be seen with us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, many
people don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re married at all: how can they?&nbsp;
Your wife&rsquo;s never seen with you.&nbsp; Oh no; anybody but those
belonging to you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greenwich Fair, indeed!&nbsp; Yes, - and of course you went
up and down the hill, running and racing with nobody knows who.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me; I know what you are when you&rsquo;re out.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t suppose, Mr. Caudle, I&rsquo;ve forgotten that pink
bonnet, do you?&nbsp; No: I won&rsquo;t hold my tongue, and I&rsquo;m
not a foolish woman.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no matter, sir, if the pink bonnet
was fifty years ago - it&rsquo;s all the same for that.&nbsp; No: and
if I live for fifty years to come, I never will leave off talking of
it.&nbsp; You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; Ha!
few wives would have been what I&rsquo;ve been to you.&nbsp; I only
wish my time was to come over again, that&rsquo;s all; I wouldn&rsquo;t
be the fool I have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to a fair! and I suppose you had your fortune told by
the gipsies?&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t have wasted your money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure I can tell you your fortune if you go on as you do.&nbsp; Yes,
the gaol will be your fortune, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; And it would be no
matter - none at all - if your wife and children didn&rsquo;t suffer
with you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you must go riding upon donkeys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t go riding upon donkeys</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s very well for you to say so: but I dare say
you did.&nbsp; I tell you, Caudle, I know what you are when you&rsquo;re
out.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t trust any of you - you especially, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must go in the thick of the fair, and have the girls
scratching your coat with rattles!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You couldn&rsquo;t help it</i>,<i> if they did scratch
your coat</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me; people don&rsquo;t scratch coats unless
they&rsquo;re encouraged to do it.&nbsp; And you must go in a swing,
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t go in a swing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you didn&rsquo;t it was no fault of yours; you wished
to go I&rsquo;ve no doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you must go into the shows?&nbsp; There, - you don&rsquo;t
deny that.&nbsp; You did go into a show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What of it</i>,<i> Mr. Caudle</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal of it, sir.&nbsp; Nice crowding and squeezing
in those shows, I know.&nbsp; Pretty places!&nbsp; And you a married
man and the father of a family.&nbsp; No: I won&rsquo;t hold my tongue.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very well for you to threaten to get up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
to go to Greenwich Fair, and race up and down the hill, and play at
kiss in the ring.&nbsp; Pah! it&rsquo;s disgusting, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
Oh, I dare say you <i>did</i> play at it; if you didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d
have liked, and that&rsquo;s just as bad; - and you can go into swings,
and shows, and roundabouts.&nbsp; If I was you, I should hide my head
under the clothes and be ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is most selfish - most mean of you, Caudle - you
can go and enjoy yourself, and never so much as bring home for the poor
children a gingerbread nut.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me that your pocket
was picked of a pound of nuts!&nbsp; Nice company you must have been
in to have your pocket picked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I daresay I shall hear all about it to-morrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
no doubt, sir, you were dancing at the Crown and Anchor.&nbsp; I should
like to have seen you.&nbsp; No: I&rsquo;m not making myself ridiculous.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s making yourself ridiculous; and everybody
that knows you says so.&nbsp; Everybody knows what I have to put up
with from you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to a fair, indeed!&nbsp; At your time - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Here</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I dozed off hearing
confusedly the words</i> - <i>hill - gipsies - rattles - roundabouts
- swings - pink bonnet - nuts</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE X - ON MR. CAUDLE&rsquo;S SHIRT-BUTTONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There, Mr. Caudle, I hope you&rsquo;re in a little better
temper than you were this morning?&nbsp; There - you needn&rsquo;t begin
to whistle: people don&rsquo;t come to bed to whistle.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
like you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t speak, that you don&rsquo;t try to insult
me.&nbsp; Once, I used to say you were the best creature living; now
you get quite a fiend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do let you rest</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: I won&rsquo;t let you rest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only
time I have to talk to you, and you <i>shall</i> hear me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
put upon all day long: it&rsquo;s very hard if I can&rsquo;t speak a
word at night: besides, it isn&rsquo;t often I open my mouth, goodness
knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because <i>once</i> in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button
you must almost swear the roof off the house!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t swear</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, Mr. Caudle! you don&rsquo;t know what you do when you&rsquo;re
in a passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You were not in a passion</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, then, I don&rsquo;t know what
a passion is - and I think I ought by this time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lived
long enough with you, Mr. Caudle, to know that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you haven&rsquo;t something worse to complain
of than a button off your shirt.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d <i>some</i> wives,
you would, I know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m never without a needle
and thread in my hand.&nbsp; What with you and the children, I&rsquo;m
made a perfect slave of.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s my thanks?&nbsp; Why,
if once in your life a button&rsquo;s off your shirt - what do you cry
&lsquo;<i>oh</i>&rsquo; at? - I say once, Mr. Caudle; or twice, or three
times, at most.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Caudle, no man&rsquo;s buttons
in the world are better looked after than yours.&nbsp; I only wish I
had kept the shirts you had when you were first married!&nbsp; I should
like to know where were your buttons then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> worth talking of!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
how you always try to put me down.&nbsp; You fly into a rage, and then
if I only try to speak you won&rsquo;t hear me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
you men always will have all the talk to yourselves: a poor woman isn&rsquo;t
allowed to get a word in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice notion you have of a wife, to suppose she&rsquo;s nothing
to think of but her husband&rsquo;s buttons.&nbsp; A pretty notion,
indeed, you have of marriage.&nbsp; Ha! if poor women only knew what
they had to go through.&nbsp; What with buttons, and one thing and another!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d never tie themselves up, - no, not to the best man in the
world, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What would they do</i>,<i> Mr. Caudle</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do much better without you, I&rsquo;m certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s my belief, after all, that the button wasn&rsquo;t
off the shirt; it&rsquo;s my belief that you pulled it off, that you
might have something to talk about.&nbsp; Oh, you&rsquo;re aggravating
enough, when you like, for anything!&nbsp; All I know is, it&rsquo;s
very odd that the button should be off the shirt; for I&rsquo;m sure
no woman&rsquo;s a greater slave to her husband&rsquo;s buttons than
I am.&nbsp; I only say, it&rsquo;s very odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s one comfort; it can&rsquo;t last long.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m worn to death with your temper, and sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t trouble
you a great while.&nbsp; Ha, you may laugh!&nbsp; And I dare say you
would laugh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your
love - that&rsquo;s your feeling!&nbsp; I know that I&rsquo;m sinking
every day, though I say nothing about it.&nbsp; And when I&rsquo;m gone,
we shall see how your second wife will look after your buttons.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll find out the difference, then.&nbsp; Yes, Caudle, you&rsquo;ll
think of me, then; for then, I hope, you&rsquo;ll never have a blessed
button to your back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a vindictive woman, Mr. Caudle; nobody ever
called me that, but you.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nobody ever knew so much of me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t have your aggravating temper, Caudle, for mines of
gold.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m not as worrying as you
are - or a nice house there&rsquo;d be between us.&nbsp; I only wish
you&rsquo;d had a wife that <i>would</i> have talked to you!&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;d have known the difference.&nbsp; But you impose upon me,
because, like a poor fool, I say nothing.&nbsp; I should be ashamed
of myself, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty example you set as a father!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
make your boys as bad as yourself.&nbsp; Talking as you did all breakfast
time about your buttons!&nbsp; And of a Sunday morning, too!&nbsp; And
you call yourself a Christian!&nbsp; I should like to know what your
boys will say of you when they grow up?&nbsp; And all about a paltry
button off one of your wristbands!&nbsp; A decent man wouldn&rsquo;t
have mentioned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why won&rsquo;t I hold my tongue</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> hold my tongue.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
to have my peace of mind destroyed - I&rsquo;m to be worried into my
grave for a miserable shirt button, and I&rsquo;m to hold my tongue!&nbsp;
Oh! but that&rsquo;s just like you men!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what I&rsquo;ll do for the future.&nbsp; Every
button you have may drop off, and I won&rsquo;t so much as put a thread
to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And I should like to know what you&rsquo;ll do then?&nbsp;
Oh, you must get somebody else to sew &rsquo;em, must you?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to a wife!&nbsp; And to such
a wife as I&rsquo;ve been, too: such a negro-slave to your buttons,
as I may say!&nbsp; Somebody else to sew &rsquo;em, eh?&nbsp; No, Caudle,
no: not while I&rsquo;m alive!&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m dead - and with
what I have to bear there&rsquo;s no knowing how soon that may be -
when I&rsquo;m dead, I say - oh! what a brute you must be to snore so!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re not snoring</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s what you always say; but that&rsquo;s nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; You must get somebody else to sew &rsquo;em, must
you?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; I
should be surprised at nothing, now!&nbsp; Nothing at all!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
what people have always told me it would come to, - and now the buttons
have opened my eyes!&nbsp; But the whole world shall know of your cruelty,
Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; After the wife I&rsquo;ve been to you.&nbsp; Somebody
else, indeed, to sew your buttons!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no longer to be mistress
in my own house!&nbsp; Ha, Caudle!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have upon
my conscience what you have, for the world!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t treat
anybody as you treat - no, I&rsquo;m not mad!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you,
Mr. Caudle, who are mad, or bad - and that&rsquo;s worse!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
even so much as speak of a shirt button, but that I&rsquo;m threatened
to be made nobody of in my own house!&nbsp; Caudle, you&rsquo;ve a heart
like a hearth-stone, you have!&nbsp; To threaten me, and only because
a button - a button - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I was conscious of no more than this</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle;
&ldquo;<i>for here nature relieved me with a sweet</i>,<i> deep sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XI - MRS. CAUDLE SUGGESTS THAT HER DEAR MOTHER SHOULD &ldquo;COME
AND LIVE WITH THEM.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Is your cold better to-night, Caudle?&nbsp; Yes; I thought
it was.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be quite well to-morrow, I dare say.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a love!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t take care enough of yourself,
Caudle, you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And you ought, I&rsquo;m sure, if only
for my sake.&nbsp; For whatever I should do, if anything was to happen
to you - but I think of it; no, I can&rsquo;t bear to think <i>of that</i>.&nbsp;
Still, you ought to take care of yourself; for you know you&rsquo;re
not strong, Caudle; you know you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t dear mother so happy with us to-night?&nbsp;
Now, you needn&rsquo;t go to sleep so suddenly.&nbsp; I say, wasn&rsquo;t
she so happy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t know</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say you don&rsquo;t know?&nbsp; You must have
seen it.&nbsp; But she is always happier here than anywhere else.&nbsp;
Ha! what a temper that dear soul has!&nbsp; I call it a temper of satin;
it is so smooth, so easy, and so soft.&nbsp; Nothing puts her out of
the way.&nbsp; And then, if you only knew how she takes your part, Caudle!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure, if you had been her own son ten times over, she couldn&rsquo;t
be fonder of you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so, Caudle?&nbsp; Eh,
love?&nbsp; Now, do answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How can you tell</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Caudle; you must have seen it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
nothing delights the dear soul so much as when she&rsquo;s thinking
how to please you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember Thursday night, the stewed oysters
when you came home?&nbsp; That was all dear mother&rsquo;s doings!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo; says she to me, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a cold night;
and don&rsquo;t you think dear Mr. Caudle would like something nice
before he goes to bed?&rsquo;&nbsp; And that, Caudle, is how the oysters
came about.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t sleep, Caudle: do listen to me for
five minutes; &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t often I speak, goodness knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, what a fuss she makes when you are out, if your
slippers aren&rsquo;t put to the fire for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s very good</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, - I know she is, Caudle.&nbsp; And hasn&rsquo;t she been
six months - though I promised her not to tell you - six months working
a watch-pocket for you!&nbsp; And with <i>her</i> eyes, dear soul -
and at <i>her</i> time of life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what a cook she is!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the dishes
she&rsquo;ll make out of next to nothing!&nbsp; I try hard enough to
follow her: but, I&rsquo;m not ashamed to own it, Caudle, she quite
beats me.&nbsp; Ha! the many nice little things she&rsquo;d simmer up
for you - and I can&rsquo;t do it; the children, you know it, Caudle,
take so much of my time.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do it, love; and I often
reproach myself that I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now, you shan&rsquo;t go to
sleep, Caudle; at least not for five minutes.&nbsp; You must hear me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking, dearest - ha! that nasty cough,
love! - I&rsquo;ve been thinking, darling, if we could only persuade
dear mother to come and live with us.&nbsp; Now, Caudle, you can&rsquo;t
be asleep; it&rsquo;s impossible - you were coughing only this minute
- yes, to live with us.&nbsp; What a treasure we should have in her!&nbsp;
Then, Caudle, you never need go to bed without something nice and hot.&nbsp;
And you want it, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t want it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you do; for you&rsquo;re not strong, Caudle; you
know you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, the money she&rsquo;d save us in housekeeping.&nbsp;
Ha! what an eye she has for a joint!&nbsp; The butcher doesn&rsquo;t
walk that could deceive dear mother.&nbsp; And then, again, for poultry!&nbsp;
What a finger and thumb she has for a chicken!&nbsp; I never could market
like her: it&rsquo;s a gift - quite a gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you recollect her marrow-puddings?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t recollect &rsquo;em</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie!&nbsp; Caudle, how often have you flung her marrow
puddings in my face, wanting to know why I couldn&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
And I wouldn&rsquo;t pretend to do it after dear mother.&nbsp; I should
think it presumption.&nbsp; Now, love, if she was only living with us
- come, you&rsquo;re not asleep, Caudle - if she was only living with
us, you could have marrow puddings every day.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t
fling yourself about and begin to swear at marrow puddings; you know
you like &rsquo;em, dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a hand, too, dear mother has for a pie crust!&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s born with some people.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why wasn&rsquo;t it born with me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, that&rsquo;s cruel - unfeeling of you; I wouldn&rsquo;t
have uttered such a reproach to you for the whole world.&nbsp; Consider,
dear; people can&rsquo;t be born as they like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often, too, have you wanted to brew at home!&nbsp; And
I never could learn anything about brewing.&nbsp; But, ha! what ale
dear mother makes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never tasted it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know that.&nbsp; But I recollect the ale we used to
have at home: and father would never drink wine after it.&nbsp; The
best sherry was nothing like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You dare say not</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it wasn&rsquo;t indeed, Caudle.&nbsp; Then, if dear mother
was only with us, what money we should save in beer!&nbsp; And then
you might always have your own nice pure, good, wholesome ale, Caudle;
and what good it would do you!&nbsp; For you&rsquo;re not strong, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then dear mother&rsquo;s jams and preserves, love!&nbsp;
I own it, Caudle; it has often gone to my heart that with cold meat
you haven&rsquo;t always had a pudding.&nbsp; Now if mother was with
us, in the matter of fruit puddings she&rsquo;d make it summer all the
year round.&nbsp; But I never could preserve - now mother does it, and
for next to no money whatever.&nbsp; What nice dogs-in-a-blanket she&rsquo;d
make for the children!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s dogs-in-a-blanket</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re delicious - as dear mother makes &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you <i>have</i> tasted her Irish stew, Caudle?&nbsp;
You remember that?&nbsp; Come, you&rsquo;re not asleep - you remember
that?&nbsp; And how fond you are of it!&nbsp; And I know I never have
it made to please you!&nbsp; Well, what a relief to me it would be if
dear mother was always at hand, that you might have a stew when you
liked.&nbsp; What a load it would be off my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, for pickles!&nbsp; Not at all like anybody else&rsquo;s
pickles.&nbsp; Her red cabbage - why, it&rsquo;s as crisp as biscuit!&nbsp;
And then her walnuts - and her all-sorts!&nbsp; Eh, Caudle?&nbsp; You
know how you love pickles; and how we sometimes tiff about &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
Now if dear mother was here, a word would never pass between us.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;m sure nothing would make me happier, for - you&rsquo;re
not asleep, Caudle? - for I can&rsquo;t bear to quarrel, can I, love?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children, too, are so fond of her!&nbsp; And she&rsquo;d
be such a help to me with &rsquo;em!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, with dear
mother in the house, I shouldn&rsquo;t care a fig for measles, or anything
of the sort.&nbsp; As a nurse, she&rsquo;s such a treasure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at her time of life, what a needle-woman!&nbsp; And the
darning and mending for the children, it really gets quite beyond me
now, Caudle.&nbsp; Now with mother at my hand, there wouldn&rsquo;t
be a stitch wanted in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when you&rsquo;re out late, Caudle - for I know
you must be out late sometimes: I can&rsquo;t expect you, of course,
to be always at home - why then dear mother could sit up for you, and
nothing would delight the dear soul half so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, Caudle, love, I think dear mother had better come,
don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Eh, Caudle?&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;re not asleep,
darling; don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d better come?&nbsp; You say
<i>No</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say <i>No</i> again?&nbsp; <i>You won&rsquo;t have her</i>,
you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t</i>,<i> that&rsquo;s flat</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle - Cau-Cau-dle - Cau - dle - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Here Mrs. Caudle</i>,&rdquo; says her husband, &ldquo;<i>suddenly
went into tears; and I went to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XII - MR. CAUDLE HAVING COME HOME A LITTLE LATE, DECLARES
THAT HENCEFORTH &ldquo;HE WILL HAVE A KEY.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, Mr. Caudle, I think it a waste of time
to come to bed at all now!&nbsp; The cocks will be crowing in a minute.&nbsp;
Keeping people up till past twelve.&nbsp; Oh yes! you&rsquo;re thought
a man of very fine feelings out of doors, I dare say!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a pity you haven&rsquo;t a little feeling for those belonging to you
at home.&nbsp; A nice hour to keep people out of their beds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did I sit up</i>,<i> then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I chose to sit up - but that&rsquo;s my thanks.&nbsp;
No, it&rsquo;s no use your talking, Caudle; I never <i>will</i> let
the girl sit up for you, and there&rsquo;s an end.&nbsp; What do you
say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why does she sit up with me</i>,<i> then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a different matter: you don&rsquo;t suppose
I&rsquo;m going to sit up alone, do you?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s the use of two sitting up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&nbsp; No, Caudle, it&rsquo;s no
such thing.&nbsp; I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> sit up because I may have the
pleasure of talking about it; and you&rsquo;re an ungrateful, unfeeling
creature to say so.&nbsp; I sit up because I choose it; and if you don&rsquo;t
come home all the night long - and &rsquo;twill soon come to that, I&rsquo;ve
no doubt - still, I&rsquo;ll never go to bed, so don&rsquo;t think it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! the time runs away very pleasantly with you men at
your clubs - selfish creatures!&nbsp; You can laugh and sing, and tell
stories, and never think of the clock; never think there&rsquo;s such
a person as a wife belonging to you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing to you
that a poor woman&rsquo;s sitting up, and telling the minutes, and seeing
all sorts of things in the fire - and sometimes thinking something dreadful
has happened to you - more fool she to care a straw about you! - This
is all nothing.&nbsp; Oh no; when a woman&rsquo;s once married she&rsquo;s
a slave - worse than a slave - and must bear it all!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what you men can find to talk about I can&rsquo;t think!&nbsp;
Instead of a man sitting every night at home with his wife, and going
to bed at a Christian hour, - going to a club, to meet a set of people
who don&rsquo;t care a button for him - it&rsquo;s monstrous!&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You only go once a week</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it: you might as well
go every night; and I daresay you will soon.&nbsp; But if you do, you
may get in as you can: <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t sit up for you, I can tell
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My health&rsquo;s being destroyed night after night, and -
oh, don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s only once a week; I tell you that&rsquo;s
nothing to do with it - if you had any eyes, you would see how ill I
am; but you&rsquo;ve no eyes for anybody belonging to you: oh no! your
eyes are for people out of doors.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very well for you
to call me a foolish, aggravating woman!&nbsp; I should like to see
the woman who&rsquo;d sit up for you as I do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t want me to sit up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; that&rsquo;s your thanks - that&rsquo;s your gratitude:
I&rsquo;m to ruin my health, and to be abused for it.&nbsp; Nice principles
you&rsquo;ve got at that club, Mr. Caudle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one comfort - one great comfort; it can&rsquo;t
last long: I&rsquo;m sinking - I feel it, though I never say anything
about it - but I know my own feelings, and I say it can&rsquo;t last
long.&nbsp; And then I should like to know who will sit up for you!&nbsp;
Then I should like to know how your second wife - what do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll never be troubled with another</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troubled, indeed!&nbsp; I never troubled you, Caudle.&nbsp;
No; it&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ve troubled me; and you know it; though
like a foolish woman I&rsquo;ve borne it all, and never said a word
about it.&nbsp; But it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> last - that&rsquo;s one blessing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if a woman could only know what she&rsquo;d have to suffer
before she was married - Don&rsquo;t tell me you want to go to sleep!&nbsp;
If you want to go to sleep, you should come home at proper hours!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s time to get up, for what I know, now.&nbsp; Shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if you hear the milk in five minutes - there&rsquo;s the sparrows
up already; yes, I say the sparrows; and, Caudle, you ought to blush
to hear &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you won&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em, you mean: <i>I</i> hear
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle; it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> the wind whistling
in the keyhole; I&rsquo;m not quite foolish, though you may think so.&nbsp;
I hope I know wind from a sparrow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! when I think what a man you were before we were married!&nbsp;
But you&rsquo;re now another person - quite an altered creature.&nbsp;
But I suppose you&rsquo;re all alike - I dare say, every poor woman&rsquo;s
troubled and put upon, though I should hope not so much as I am.&nbsp;
Indeed, I should hope not!&nbsp; Going and staying out, and -</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll have a key</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&nbsp; Not while I&rsquo;m alive, Mr Caudle.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to bed with the door upon the latch for you or the
best man breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t have a latch - you&rsquo;ll have a Chubb&rsquo;s
lock</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no Chubb here, I can tell
you.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll have the lock put on to-morrow</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try it; that&rsquo;s all I say, Caudle; try it.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t let you put me in a passion; but all I say is, - try it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A respectable thing, that, for a married man to carry about
with him, - a street-door key!&nbsp; That tells a tale I think.&nbsp;
A nice thing for the father of a family!&nbsp; A key!&nbsp; What, to
let yourself in and out when you please!&nbsp; To come in, like a thief
in the middle of the night, instead of knocking at the door like a decent
person!&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me that you only want to prevent
me sitting up - if I choose to sit up what&rsquo;s that to you?&nbsp;
Some wives, indeed, would make a noise about sitting up, but <i>you&rsquo;ve</i>
no reason to complain - goodness knows!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my word, I&rsquo;ve lived to hear something.&nbsp;
Carry the street-door key about with you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of
such things with young good-for-nothing bachelors, with nobody to care
what became of &rsquo;em; but for a married man to leave his wife and
children in a house with a door upon the latch - don&rsquo;t talk to
me about Chubb, it&rsquo;s all the same - a great deal you must care
for us.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s very well for you to say that you only
want the key for peace and quietness - what&rsquo;s it to you, if I
like to sit up?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no business to complain; it can&rsquo;t
distress you.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s no use your talking; all I say is
this, Caudle: if you send a man to put on any lock here, I&rsquo;ll
call in a policeman; as I&rsquo;m your married wife, I will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think when a man comes to have the street-door key,
the sooner he turns bachelor altogether the better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure, Caudle, I don&rsquo;t want to be any clog upon you.&nbsp; Now,
it&rsquo;s no use your telling me to hold my tongue, for I - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I give you the headache</i>,<i> do I</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Caudle; it&rsquo;s your club that gives
you the headache; it&rsquo;s your smoke, and your - well! if ever I
knew such a man in all my life! there&rsquo;s no saying a word to you!&nbsp;
You go out, and treat yourself like an emperor - and come home at twelve
at night, or any hour for what I know, and then you threaten to have
a key, and - and - and - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I did</i> <i>get to sleep at last</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle,
&ldquo;<i>amidst the falling sentences of</i> &lsquo;<i>take children
into a lodging</i>&rsquo; - &lsquo;<i>separate maintenance</i>&rsquo;
- &lsquo;<i>won&rsquo;t be made a slave of</i>&rsquo; - <i>and so forth</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XIII - MRS. CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO SEE HER DEAR MOTHER. - CAUDLE,
ON THE &ldquo;JOYFUL OCCASION,&rdquo; HAS GIVEN A PARTY, AND ISSUED
A CARD OF INVITATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> hard, I think, Mr. Caudle, that I can&rsquo;t
leave home for a day or two, but the house must be turned into a tavern:
a tavern? - a pothouse!&nbsp; Yes, I thought you were very anxious that
I should go; I thought you wanted to get rid of me for something, or
you would not have insisted on my staying at dear mother&rsquo;s all
night.&nbsp; You were afraid I should get cold coming home, were you?&nbsp;
Oh yes, you can be very tender, you can, Mr. Caudle, when it suits your
own purpose.&nbsp; Yes! and the world thinks what a good husband you
are!&nbsp; I only wish the world knew you as well as I do, that&rsquo;s
all; but it shall, some day, I&rsquo;m determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the house will not be sweet for a month.&nbsp;
All the curtains are poisoned with smoke; and what&rsquo;s more, with
the filthiest smoke I ever knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Take &rsquo;em down</i>,<i> then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well for you to say take &rsquo;em
down; but they were only cleaned and put up a month ago; but a careful
wife&rsquo;s lost upon you, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; You ought to have married
somebody who&rsquo;d have let your house go to wreck and ruin, as I
will for the future.&nbsp; People who don&rsquo;t care for their families
are better thought of than those who do; I&rsquo;ve long found out <i>that.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a condition the carpet&rsquo;s in!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
taken five pounds out of it, if a farthing, with their filthy boots,
and I don&rsquo;t know what besides.&nbsp; And then the smoke in the
hearthrug, and a large cinder-hole burnt in it!&nbsp; I never saw such
a house in <i>my</i> life!&nbsp; If you wanted to have a few friends,
why couldn&rsquo;t you invite &rsquo;em when your wife&rsquo;s at home,
like any other man? not have &rsquo;em sneaking in, like a set of housebreakers,
directly a woman turns her back.&nbsp; They must be pretty gentlemen,
they must; mean fellows, that are afraid to face a woman!&nbsp; Ha!
and you all call yourselves the lords of the creation!&nbsp; I should
only like to see what would become of the creation, if you were left
to yourselves!&nbsp; A pretty pickle creation would be in very soon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must all have been in a nice condition!&nbsp; What do
you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You took nothing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took nothing, didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s
such a regiment of empty bottles, I haven&rsquo;t had the heart to count
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; And punch, too! you must have punch!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
a hundred half-lemons in the kitchen, if there&rsquo;s one: for Susan,
like a good girl, kept &rsquo;em to show &rsquo;em me.&nbsp; No, sir;
Susan <i>shan&rsquo;t leave the house</i>!&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She has no right to tell tales</i>,<i> and you</i> WILL
<i>be master in your own house</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t alter, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;ll
soon have no house to be master of.&nbsp; A whole loaf of sugar did
I leave in the cupboard, and now there isn&rsquo;t as much as would
fill a teacup.&nbsp; Do you suppose I&rsquo;m to find sugar for punch
for fifty men?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>There wasn&rsquo;t fifty</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no matter; the more shame for &rsquo;em, sir.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure they drank enough for fifty.&nbsp; Do you suppose I&rsquo;m
to find sugar for punch for all the world out of my housekeeping money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t ask me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask me?&nbsp; You do; you know you do: for
if I only want a shilling extra, the house is in a blaze.&nbsp; And
yet a whole loaf of sugar can you throw away upon - No, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
be still; and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> let you go to sleep.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d
got to bed at a proper hour last night, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been
so sleepy now.&nbsp; You can sit up half the night with a pack of people
who don&rsquo;t care for you, and your poor wife can&rsquo;t get in
a word!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s that china image that I had when I was married
- I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken any sum of money for it, and you know
it - and how do I find it?&nbsp; With its precious head knocked off!&nbsp;
And what was more mean, more contemptible than all besides, it was put
on again, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You knew nothing about it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how can you lie there, in your Christian bed, Caudle,
and say that?&nbsp; You know that that fellow, Prettyman, knocked off
the head with the poker!&nbsp; You know that he did.&nbsp; And you hadn&rsquo;t
the feeling - yes, I will say it - you hadn&rsquo;t the feeling to protect
what you knew was precious to me.&nbsp; Oh no, if the truth was known,
you were glad to see it broken for that very reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every way I&rsquo;ve been insulted.&nbsp; I should like to
know who it was who corked whiskers on my dear aunt&rsquo;s picture?&nbsp;
Oh! you&rsquo;re laughing, are you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re not laughing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that.&nbsp; I should like to know what
shakes the bed, then, if you&rsquo;re not laughing?&nbsp; Yes, corked
whiskers on her dear face, - and she was a dear soul to you, Caudle,
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to see her ill-used.&nbsp; Oh,
you may laugh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very easy to laugh!&nbsp; I only wish
you&rsquo;d a little feeling, like other people, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s my china mug - the mug I had before I was
married - when I was a happy creature.&nbsp; I should like to know who
knocked the spout off that mug?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me it was cracked
before - it&rsquo;s no such thing, Caudle; there wasn&rsquo;t a flaw
in it - and now, I could have cried when I saw it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell me it wasn&rsquo;t worth twopence.&nbsp; How do you know?&nbsp;
You never buy mugs.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s like men; they think nothing
in a house costs anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s four glasses broke, and nine cracked.&nbsp;
At least, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve found out at present; but I daresay
I shall discover a dozen to-morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should like to know where the cotton umbrella&rsquo;s
gone to - and I should like to know who broke the bell-pull - and perhaps
you don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a leg off a chair, - and perhaps
- &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I was resolved</i>,&rdquo; said Caudle, &ldquo;<i>to know
nothing</i>,<i> and so went to sleep in my ignorance</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XIV - MRS. CAUDLE THINKS IT &ldquo;HIGH TIME&rdquo; THAT
THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE SUMMER CLOTHING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There, Caudle!&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s anything in the world
I hate - and you know it, Caudle - it is asking you for money.&nbsp;
I am sure for myself, I&rsquo;d rather go without a thing a thousand
times, and I do - the more shame of you to let me, but - there, now!
there you fly out again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I want now</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you must know what&rsquo;s wanted, if you&rsquo;d any
eyes - or any pride for your children, like any other father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s the matter - and what am I driving at</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Caudle!&nbsp; As if you didn&rsquo;t know!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure if I&rsquo;d any money of my own, I&rsquo;d never ask
you for a farthing; never; it&rsquo;s painful to me, goodness knows!&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If it&rsquo;s painful</i>,<i> why so often do it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I suppose you call that a joke - one of your club
jokes?&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d think a little more of people&rsquo;s
feelings, and less of your jokes.&nbsp; As I say, I only wish I&rsquo;d
any money of my own.&nbsp; If there is anything that humbles a poor
woman, it is coming to a man&rsquo;s pocket for every farthing.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s dreadful!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, if ever you kept awake, you shall keep awake
to-night - yes, you shall hear me, for it isn&rsquo;t often I speak,
and then you may go to sleep as soon as you like.&nbsp; Pray do you
know what month it is?&nbsp; And did you see how the children looked
at church to-day - like nobody else&rsquo;s children?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What was the matter with them</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caudle!&nbsp; How can you ask?&nbsp; Poor things! weren&rsquo;t
they all in their thick merinos and beaver bonnets?&nbsp; What do you
say? -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you&rsquo;ll tell me that you didn&rsquo;t see how the
Briggs&rsquo;s girls, in their new chips, turned their noses up at &rsquo;em?&nbsp;
And you didn&rsquo;t see how the Browns looked at the Smiths, and then
at our dear girls, as much as to say, &lsquo;Poor creatures! what figures
for the month of May!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t see it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more shame for you - you would, if you&rsquo;d had the
feelings of a parent - but I&rsquo;m sorry to say, Caudle, you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure those Briggs&rsquo;s girls - the little minxes! - put
me into such a pucker, I could have pulled their ears for &rsquo;em
over the pew.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I ought to be ashamed of myself to own it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Caudle; the shame lies with you, that don&rsquo;t
let your children appear at church like other people&rsquo;s children,
that make &rsquo;em uncomfortable at their devotions, poor things! for
how can it be otherwise, when they see themselves dressed like nobody
else?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, it&rsquo;s no use talking; those children shall
not cross the threshold next Sunday, if they haven&rsquo;t things for
the summer.&nbsp; Now mind - they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t; and there&rsquo;s
an end of it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em exposed to the Briggs&rsquo;s
and the Browns again: no, they shall know they have a mother, if they&rsquo;ve
no father to feel for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; What do you say, Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A good deal I must think of church</i>,<i> if I think so
much of what we go in</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish you thought as much as I do, you&rsquo;d be a
better man than you are, Caudle, I can tell you; but that&rsquo;s nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking about decent clothes for the
children for the summer, and you want to put me off with something about
the church; but that&rsquo;s so like you, Caudle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m always wanting money for clothes</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you lie in your bed and say that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure there&rsquo;s no children in the world that cost their father so
little: but that&rsquo;s it; the less a poor woman does upon, the less
she may.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the wives who don&rsquo;t care where the money
comes from who&rsquo;re best thought of.&nbsp; Oh, if my time was to
come over again, would I mend and stitch, and make the things go so
far as I have done?&nbsp; No - that I wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s
very well for you to lie there and laugh; it&rsquo;s easy to laugh,
Caudle - very easy, to people who don&rsquo;t feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, dear!&nbsp; What a man you are!&nbsp; I know
you&rsquo;ll give me the money, because, after all, I think you love
your children, and like to see &rsquo;em well dressed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
only natural that a father should.&nbsp; Eh, Caudle, eh?&nbsp; Now you
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to sleep till you&rsquo;ve told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How much money do I want</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, let me see, love.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Caroline, and Jane,
and Susannah, and Mary Anne, and - What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I needn&rsquo;t count &rsquo;em; you know how many there
are</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s just as you take me up.&nbsp; Well, how much
money will it take?&nbsp; Let me see; and don&rsquo;t go to sleep.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute.&nbsp; You always love to see the dear
things like new pins, I know that, Caudle; and though I say it - bless
their little hearts! - they do credit to you, Caudle.&nbsp; Any nobleman
of the land might be proud of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t swear
at noblemen of the land, and ask me what they&rsquo;ve to do with your
children; you know what I meant.&nbsp; But you <i>are</i> so hasty,
Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How much</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry!&nbsp; Well, I think, with
good pinching - and you know, Caudle, there&rsquo;s never a wife who
can pinch closer than I can - I think, with pinching, I can do with
twenty pounds.&nbsp; What did you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Twenty fiddlesticks</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t give half the money</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Caudle; I don&rsquo;t care: let the children
go in rags; let them stop from church, and grow up like heathens and
cannibals, and then you&rsquo;ll save your money, and, I suppose, be
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You gave me twenty pounds five months ago</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s five months ago to do with now?&nbsp; Besides,
what I <i>have</i> had is nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ten pounds are enough</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just like you men; you think things cost nothing for
women; but you don&rsquo;t care how much you lay out upon yourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They only want bonnets and frocks</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what they want?&nbsp; <i>How</i> should a
man know anything at all about it?&nbsp; And you won&rsquo;t give more
than ten pounds?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; Then you may go shopping with
it yourself, and see what <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> make of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
have none of your ten pounds, I can tell you.&nbsp; No, sir, - no; you
have no cause to say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t want to dress the children up like countesses</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You often fling that in my teeth, you do: but you know it&rsquo;s
false, Caudle; you know it.&nbsp; I only want to give &rsquo;em proper
notions of themselves: and what, indeed, <i>can</i> the poor things
think when they see the Briggs&rsquo;s, and the Browns, and the Smiths
- and their fathers don&rsquo;t make the money you do, Caudle - when
they see them as fine as tulips?&nbsp; Why, they must think themselves
nobody; and to think yourself nobody - depend upon it, Caudle, - isn&rsquo;t
the way to make the world think anything of you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where did I pick up that</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think?&nbsp; I know a great deal more than you
suppose - yes; though you don&rsquo;t give me credit for it.&nbsp; Husbands
seldom do.&nbsp; However, the twenty pounds I <i>will</i> have, if I&rsquo;ve
any - or not a farthing.&nbsp; No, sir, no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t want to dress up the children like peacocks
and parrots</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want to make &rsquo;em respectable and - what do you
say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll give fifteen pounds</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caudle, no - not a penny will I take under twenty; if
I did, it would seem as if I wanted to waste your money: and I&rsquo;m
sure, when I come to think of it, twenty pounds will hardly do.&nbsp;
Still, if you&rsquo;ll give me twenty - no, it&rsquo;s no use your offering
fifteen, and wanting to go to sleep.&nbsp; You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t close
an eye until you promise me twenty.&nbsp; Come, Caudle, love! - twenty,
and then you may go to sleep.&nbsp; Twenty - twenty - twenty - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My impression is</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>that
I fell asleep sticking firmly to the fifteen; but in the morning Mrs.
Caudle assured me</i>,<i> as a woman of honour</i>,<i> that she wouldn&rsquo;t
let me wink an eye before I promised the twenty: and man is frail -
and woman is strong - she had the money</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XV - MR. CAUDLE HAS AGAIN STAYED OUT LATE.&nbsp; MRS. CAUDLE,
AT FIRST INJURED AND VIOLENT, MELTS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;ll tell me where this is to
end?&nbsp; Though, goodness knows, I needn&rsquo;t ask <i>that</i>.&nbsp;
The end is plain enough.&nbsp; Out - out - out!&nbsp; Every night -
every night!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, men who can&rsquo;t come home at
reasonable hours have no business with wives: they have no right to
destroy other people, if they choose to go to destruction themselves.&nbsp;
Ha, lord!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&nbsp; I only hope none of my girls will ever
marry - I hope they&rsquo;ll none of &rsquo;em ever be the slave their
poor mother is: they shan&rsquo;t, if I can help it.&nbsp; What do you
say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nothing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t wonder at that, Mr. Caudle? you ought
to be ashamed to speak; I don&rsquo;t wonder that you can&rsquo;t open
your mouth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only astonished that at such hours you have
the confidence to knock at your own door.&nbsp; Though I&rsquo;m your
wife, I must say it, I do sometimes wonder at your impudence.&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nothing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you are an aggravating creature, Caudle; lying there like
the mummy of a man, and never as much as opening your lips to one.&nbsp;
Just as if your own wife wasn&rsquo;t worth answering!&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
so when you&rsquo;re out, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Oh no! then you can
talk fast enough; here, there&rsquo;s no getting a word from you.&nbsp;
But you treat your wife as no other man does - and you know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out - out every night!&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You haven&rsquo;t been out this week before</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it.&nbsp; You might
just as well be out all the week as once - just!&nbsp; And I should
like to know what could keep you out till these hours?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Business</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes - I dare say!&nbsp; Pretty business a married man
and the father of a family must have out of doors at one in the morning.&nbsp;
What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shall drive you mad</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; you haven&rsquo;t feelings enough to go mad - you&rsquo;d
be a better man, Caudle, if you had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will I listen to you</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;ve some story
to put me off with - you can all do that, and laugh at us afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caudle, don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not always
trying to find fault - not I.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you.&nbsp; I never speak
but when there&rsquo;s occasion; and what in my time I&rsquo;ve put
up with there isn&rsquo;t anybody in the world that knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will I hear your story</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you may tell it if you please; go on: only mind, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
believe a word of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not such a fool as other women
are, I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now - don&rsquo;t begin to swear - but go on - &rdquo;
-</p>
<p>&ldquo; - And that&rsquo;s your story, is it?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
your excuse for the hours you keep!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your apology
for undermining my health and ruining your family!&nbsp; What do you
think your children will say of you when they grow up - going and throwing
away your money upon good-for-nothing pot-house acquaintance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s not a pot-house acquaintance</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, then?&nbsp; Come, you haven&rsquo;t told me that;
but I know - it&rsquo;s that Prettyman!&nbsp; Yes, to be sure it is!&nbsp;
Upon my life!&nbsp; Well, if I&rsquo;ve hardly patience to lie in the
bed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve wanted a silver teapot these five years, and you
must go and throw away as much money as - what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You haven&rsquo;t thrown it away</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Then my name&rsquo;s not Margaret,
that&rsquo;s all I know!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man gets arrested, and because he&rsquo;s taken from his
wife and family, and locked up, you must go and trouble your head with
it!&nbsp; And you must be mixing yourself up with nasty sheriff&rsquo;s
officers - pah!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not fit to enter a
decent house - and go running from lawyer to lawyer to get bail, and
settle the business, as you call it!&nbsp; A pretty settlement you&rsquo;ll
make of it - mark my words!&nbsp; Yes - and to mend the matter, to finish
it quite, you must be one of the bail!&nbsp; That any man who isn&rsquo;t
a born fool should do such a thing for another!&nbsp; Do you think anybody
would do as much for you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say yes?&nbsp; Well, I only wish - just to show that I&rsquo;m
right - I only wish you were in a condition to try &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I should only like to see you arrested.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d find the difference
- that you would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s other people&rsquo;s affairs to you?&nbsp; If
you were locked up, depend upon it, there&rsquo;s not a soul would come
near you.&nbsp; No; it&rsquo;s all very fine now, when people think
there isn&rsquo;t a chance of your being in trouble - but I should only
like to see what they&rsquo;d say to you if <i>you</i> were in a sponging-house.&nbsp;
Yes - I should enjoy <i>that</i>, just to show you that I&rsquo;m always
right.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You think better of the world</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that would be all very well if you could afford it; but
you&rsquo;re not in means, I know, to think so well of people as all
that.&nbsp; And of course they only laugh at you.&nbsp; &lsquo;Caudle&rsquo;s
an easy fool,&rsquo; they cry - I know it as well as if I heard &rsquo;em
- &lsquo;Caudle&rsquo;s an easy fool; anybody may lead him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yes anybody but his own wife; - and she - of course - is nobody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, everybody that&rsquo;s arrested will of course send
to you.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;ll have your hands full now,
no doubt of it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll soon know every sponging-house and
every sheriff&rsquo;s officer in London.&nbsp; Your business will have
to take care of itself; you&rsquo;ll have enough to do to run from lawyer
to lawyer after the business of other people.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s
no use calling me a dear soul - not a bit!&nbsp; No; and I shan&rsquo;t
put it off till to-morrow.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often I speak, but I
<i>will</i> speak now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that Prettyman had been at the bottom of the sea before
- what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It isn&rsquo;t Prettyman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s very well for you to say so; but I know it
is; it&rsquo;s just like him.&nbsp; He looks like a man that&rsquo;s
always in debt - that&rsquo;s always in a sponging-house.&nbsp; Anybody
might swear it.&nbsp; I knew it from the very first time you brought
him here - from the very night he put his nasty dirty wet boots on my
bright steel fender.&nbsp; Any woman could see what the fellow was in
a minute.&nbsp; Prettyman! a pretty gentleman, truly, to be robbing
your wife and family!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you let him stop in the sponging - Now
don&rsquo;t call upon heaven in that way, and ask me to be quiet, for
I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t you let him stop there?&nbsp;
He got himself in; he might have got himself out again.&nbsp; And you
must keep me awake, ruin my sleep, my health, and for what you care,
my peace of mind.&nbsp; Ha! everybody but you can see how I&rsquo;m
breaking.&nbsp; You can do all this while you&rsquo;re talking with
a set of low bailiffs!&nbsp; A great deal you must think of your children
to go into a lawyer&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you must be bail - you must be bound - for Mr. Prettyman!&nbsp;
You may say, bound!&nbsp; Yes - you&rsquo;ve your hands nicely tied,
now.&nbsp; How he laughs at you - and serve you right!&nbsp; Why, in
another week he&rsquo;ll be in the East Indies; of course he will!&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;ll have to pay his debts; yes, your children may go in
rags, so that Mr. Prettyman - what do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It isn&rsquo;t Prettyman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know better.&nbsp; Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Prettyman that&rsquo;s
kept you out, - if it isn&rsquo;t Prettyman you&rsquo;re bail for -
who is it, then?&nbsp; I ask, who is it, then?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My brother</i>?<i>&nbsp; Brother Tom</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caudle! dear Caudle - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It was too much for the poor soul</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle;
&ldquo;<i>she sobbed as if her heart would break</i>,<i> and I</i> -
&rdquo; and here the MS. is blotted, as though Caudle himself had dropped
tears as he wrote.</p>

<h2>LECTURE XVI - BABY IS TO BE CHRISTENED; MRS. CAUDLE CANVASSES THE
MERITS OF PROBABLE GODFATHERS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, love, about baby&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; The dear thing&rsquo;s
three months old, and not a name to its back yet.&nbsp; There you go
again!&nbsp; Talk of it to-morrow!&nbsp; No; we&rsquo;ll talk of it
to-night.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no having a word with you in the daytime
- but here you can&rsquo;t leave me.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t say you wish
you could, Caudle; that&rsquo;s unkind, and not treating a wife - especially
the wife to you - as she deserves.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often that I
speak but I <i>do</i> believe you&rsquo;d like never to hear the sound
of my voice.&nbsp; I might as well have been born dumb!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the baby <i>must</i> have a godfather; and so, Caudle,
who shall we have?&nbsp; Who do you think will be able to do the most
for it?&nbsp; No, Caudle, no; I&rsquo;m not a selfish woman - nothing
of the sort - but I hope I&rsquo;ve the feelings of a mother; and what&rsquo;s
the use of a godfather if he gives nothing else to the child but a name?&nbsp;
A child might almost as well not be christened at all.&nbsp; And so
who shall we have?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anybody</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself, Caudle?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you think something will happen to you, to talk in that way?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know where you pick up such principles.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
thinking who there is among our acquaintance who can do the most for
the blessed creature, and you say, - &lsquo;<i>Anybody</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Caudle, you&rsquo;re quite a heathen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Wagstaff.&nbsp; No chance of his ever marrying,
and he&rsquo;s very fond of babies.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s plenty of money,
Caudle; and I think he might be got.&nbsp; Babies, I know it - babies
are his weak side.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a blessed thing to find
our dear child in his will?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you speak?&nbsp; I
declare, Caudle, you seem to care no more for the child than if it was
a stranger&rsquo;s.&nbsp; People who can&rsquo;t love children more
than you do, ought never to have &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t like Wagstaff</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I much; but what&rsquo;s that to do with it?&nbsp;
People who&rsquo;ve their families to provide for, mustn&rsquo;t think
of their feelings.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like him; but then I&rsquo;m
a mother, and love my baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t have Wagstaff and that&rsquo;s flat</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, Caudle, you&rsquo;re like nobody else - not fit for this
world, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Pugsby?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear his
wife; but that&rsquo;s nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I know my duty to
my babe: I wish other people did.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pugsby&rsquo;s a wicked fellow</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s like you - always giving people a bad name.&nbsp;
We mustn&rsquo;t always believe what the world says, Caudle; it doesn&rsquo;t
become us as Christians to do it.&nbsp; I only know that he hasn&rsquo;t
chick or child; and, besides that, he&rsquo;s very strong interest in
the Blue-coats; and so, if Pugsby - Now, don&rsquo;t fly out at the
man in that manner.&nbsp; Caudle, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t speak well of anybody.&nbsp; Where <i>do</i> you think
to go to?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, then, to Sniggins?&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t
bounce round in that way, letting the cold air into the bed!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the matter with Sniggins?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You wouldn&rsquo;t ask him a favour for the world</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing the baby has somebody to care
for it: <i>I</i> will.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shan&rsquo;t</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, I can tell you.&nbsp; Sniggins, besides being a warm
man, has good interest in the Customs; and there&rsquo;s nice pickings
there, if one only goes the right way to get &rsquo;em.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
no use, Caudle, your fidgetting about - not a bit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
going to have baby lost - sacrificed, I may say, like its brothers and
sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I mean by sacrificed</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean very well.&nbsp; What have any of
&rsquo;em got by their godfathers beyond a half-pint mug, a knife and
fork, and spoon - and a shabby coat, that I know was bought second-hand,
for I could almost swear to the place?&nbsp; And then there was your
fine friend Hartley&rsquo;s wife - what did she give to Caroline?&nbsp;
Why, a trumpery lace cap it made me blush to look at.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It was the best she could afford</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;d no right to stand for the child.&nbsp; People
who can&rsquo;t do better than that have no business to take the responsibility
of godmother.&nbsp; They ought to know their duties better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Caudle, you can&rsquo;t object to Goldman?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,<i> you do</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever such a man!&nbsp; What for?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s a usurer and a hunks</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure, you&rsquo;ve no business in this world,
Caudle; you have such high-flown notions.&nbsp; Why, isn&rsquo;t the
man as rich as the bank?&nbsp; And as for his being a usurer, - isn&rsquo;t
it all the better for those who come after him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s well there&rsquo;s some people in the world who save money,
seeing the stupid creatures who throw it away.&nbsp; But you are the
strangest man!&nbsp; I really believe you think money a sin, instead
of the greatest blessing; for I can&rsquo;t mention any of our acquaintance
that&rsquo;s rich - and I&rsquo;m sure we don&rsquo;t know too many
such people - that you haven&rsquo;t something to say against &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only beggars that you like - people with not a shilling to
bless themselves.&nbsp; Ha! though you&rsquo;re my husband, I must say
it - you&rsquo;re a man of low notions, Caudle.&nbsp; I only hope none
of the dear boys will take after their father!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should like to know what&rsquo;s the objection to Goldman?&nbsp;
The only thing against him is his name; I must confess it, I don&rsquo;t
like the name of Lazarus: it&rsquo;s low, and doesn&rsquo;t sound genteel
- not at all respectable.&nbsp; But after he&rsquo;s gone and done what&rsquo;s
proper for the child, the boy could easily slip Lazarus into Laurence.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m told the thing&rsquo;s done often.&nbsp; No, Caudle, don&rsquo;t
say that - I&rsquo;m not a mean woman - certainly not; quite the reverse.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve only a parent&rsquo;s love for my children; and I must say
it - I wish everybody felt as I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, if the truth was known, you&rsquo;d like your tobacco-pipe
friend, your pot-companion, Prettyman, to stand for the child?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;d have no objection</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought not!&nbsp; Yes; I knew what it was coming to.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a beggar, he is; and a person who stays out half the night;
yes, he does; and it&rsquo;s no use your denying it - a beggar and a
tippler, and that&rsquo;s the man you&rsquo;d make godfather to your
own flesh and blood!&nbsp; Upon my word, Caudle, it&rsquo;s enough to
make a woman get up and dress herself to hear you talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can hardly tell you, if you won&rsquo;t have Wagstaff,
or Pugsby, or Sniggins, or Goldman, or somebody that&rsquo;s respectable,
to do what&rsquo;s proper, the child sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be christened
at all.&nbsp; As for Prettyman, or any such raff - no, never!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a certain set of people that poverty&rsquo;s
catching from, and that Prettyman&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Now,
Caudle, I won&rsquo;t have my dear child lost by any of your spittoon
acquaintance, I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; unless I can have <i>my</i> way, the child sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
be christened at all.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It must have a name</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;must&rsquo; at all in the case - none.&nbsp;
No, it shall have no name; and then see what the world will say.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll call it Number Six - yes, that will do as well as anything
else, unless I&rsquo;ve the godfather I like.&nbsp; Number Six Caudle!
ha! ha!&nbsp; I think that must make you ashamed of yourself if anything
can.&nbsp; Number Six Caudle - a much better name than Mr. Prettyman
could give; yes, Number Six.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anything but Number Seven</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caudle, if ever - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>At this moment</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>little
Number Six began to cry; and taking advantage of the happy accident
I somehow got to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XVII - CAUDLE IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY HAS VENTURED TO QUESTION
THE ECONOMY OF &ldquo;WASHING AT HOME.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&nbsp; A pretty temper you come to bed in, Mr. Caudle,
I can see!&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t deny it - I think I ought to know by
this time.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s always the way; whenever I get up a
few things, the house can hardly hold you!&nbsp; Nobody cries out more
about clean linen than you do - and nobody leads a poor woman so miserable
a life when she tries to make her husband comfortable.&nbsp; Yes, Mr.
Caudle - comfortable!&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t keep chewing the word,
as if you couldn&rsquo;t swallow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was there ever such a woman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caudle; I hope not: I should hope no other wife was ever
put upon as I am!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very well for you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
have a little wash at home like anybody else but you must go about the
house swearing to yourself, and looking at your wife as if she was your
bitterest enemy.&nbsp; But I suppose you&rsquo;d rather we didn&rsquo;t
wash at all.&nbsp; Yes; then you&rsquo;d be happy!&nbsp; To be sure
you would - you&rsquo;d like to have all the children in their dirt,
like potatoes: anything, so that it didn&rsquo;t disturb you.&nbsp;
I wish you&rsquo;d had a wife who never washed - <i>she&rsquo;d</i>
have suited you, she would.&nbsp; Yes; a fine lady who&rsquo;d have
let your children go that you might have scraped &rsquo;em.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
have been much better cared for than I am.&nbsp; I only wish I could
let all of you go without clean linen at all - yes, all of you.&nbsp;
I wish I could!&nbsp; And if I wasn&rsquo;t a slave to my family, unlike
anybody else, I should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Caudle; the house isn&rsquo;t tossed about in water
as if it was Noah&rsquo;s Ark.&nbsp; And you ought to be ashamed of
yourself to talk of Noah&rsquo;s Ark in that loose manner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to be married to a man
of such principles.&nbsp; No: and the whole house <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>
taste of soap-suds either; and if it did, any other man but yourself
would be above naming it.&nbsp; I suppose I don&rsquo;t like washing-day
any more than yourself.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,<i> I do</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you&rsquo;re wrong there, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; No; I don&rsquo;t
like it because it makes everybody else uncomfortable.&nbsp; No; and
I ought not to have been born a mermaid, that I might always have been
in water.&nbsp; A mermaid, indeed!&nbsp; What next will you call me?&nbsp;
But no man, Mr. Caudle, says such things to his wife as you.&nbsp; However,
as I&rsquo;ve said before, it can&rsquo;t last long, that&rsquo;s one
comfort.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re glad of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brute, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; No, you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>
mean washing: I know what you mean.&nbsp; A pretty speech to a woman
who&rsquo;s been the wife to you I have!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll repent it
when it&rsquo;s too late: yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t have your feelings when
I&rsquo;m gone, Caudle; no, not for the Bank of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we only wash once a fortnight!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I
only wish you had some wives, they&rsquo;d wash once a week!&nbsp; Besides,
if once a fortnight&rsquo;s too much for you, why don&rsquo;t you give
me money that we may have things to go a month?&nbsp; Is it <i>my</i>
fault if we&rsquo;re short?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My &lsquo;once a fortnight&rsquo; lasts three days</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t; never; well, very seldom, and that&rsquo;s
the same thing.&nbsp; Can I help it, if the blacks will fly, and the
things must be rinsed again?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say that; I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>
made happy by the blacks, and they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> prolong my enjoyment;
and, more than that, you&rsquo;re an unfeeling man to say so.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re enough to make a woman wish herself in her grave - you
are, Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty example you set to your sons!&nbsp; Because we&rsquo;d
a little wash to-day, and there wasn&rsquo;t a hot dinner - and who
thinks of getting anything hot for washer-women? - because you hadn&rsquo;t
everything as you always have it, you must swear at the cold mutton
- and you don&rsquo;t know what that mutton costs a pound, I dare say
- you must swear at a sweet, wholesome joint like a lord.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t swear</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s very well for you to say so; but I know when
you&rsquo;re swearing; and you swear when you little think it; and I
say you must go on swearing as you did, and seize your hat like a savage,
and rush out of the house, and go and take your dinner at a tavern!&nbsp;
A pretty wife people must think you have, when they find you dining
at a public-house.&nbsp; A nice home they must think you have, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp;
What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll do so every time I wash</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Caudle - very well.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll soon
see who&rsquo;s tired of that, first; for I&rsquo;ll wash a stocking
a day if that&rsquo;s all, sooner than you should have everything as
you like.&nbsp; Ha! that&rsquo;s so like you: you&rsquo;d trample everybody
under foot, if you could - you know you would, Caudle, so don&rsquo;t
deny it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you begin to shout in that manner, I&rsquo;ll leave
the bed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very hard that I can&rsquo;t say a single
word to you, but you must almost raise the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t shout</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you call shouting, then!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure the people must hear you in the next house.&nbsp; No - it won&rsquo;t
do to call me soft names, now, Caudle: I&rsquo;m not the fool that I
was when I was first married - I know better now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
to treat me in the manner you have, all day; and then at night, the
only time and place when I can get a word in, you want to go to sleep.&nbsp;
How can you be so mean, Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why can&rsquo;t I put the washing out</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you have asked that a thousand times, but it&rsquo;s
no use, Caudle; so don&rsquo;t ask it again.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t put
it out.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mrs. Prettyman says it&rsquo;s quite as cheap</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, what&rsquo;s Mrs. Prettyman to me?&nbsp; I should think,
Mr. Caudle, that I know very well how to take care of my family without
Mrs. Prettyman&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; Mrs. Prettyman, indeed!&nbsp; I
only wish she&rsquo;d come here, that I might tell her so!&nbsp; Mrs.
Prettyman!&nbsp; But, perhaps she&rsquo;d better come and take care
of your house for you!&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt she&rsquo;d
do it much better than I do - <i>much</i>.&nbsp; No, Caudle!&nbsp; <i>I
won&rsquo;t hold my tongue</i>.&nbsp; I think I ought to be mistress
of my own washing by this time - and after the wife I&rsquo;ve been
to you, it&rsquo;s cruel of you to go on as you do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me about putting the washing out.&nbsp; I
say it isn&rsquo;t so cheap - I don&rsquo;t care whether you wash by
the dozen or not - it isn&rsquo;t so cheap; I&rsquo;ve reduced everything,
and I save at least a shilling a week.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A trumpery shilling</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I only hope to goodness you&rsquo;ll not come to
want, talking of shillings in the way you do.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t
begin about your comfort: don&rsquo;t go on aggravating me, and asking
me if your comfort&rsquo;s not worth a shilling a week?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
nothing at all to do with it - nothing: but that&rsquo;s your way -
when I talk of one thing, you talk of another; that&rsquo;s so like
you men, and you know it.&nbsp; Allow me to tell you, Mr. Caudle, that
a shilling a week is two pound twelve a year; and take two pound twelve
a year for, let us say, thirty years, and - well, you needn&rsquo;t
groan, Mr. Caudle - I don&rsquo;t suppose it will be so long; oh, no!
you&rsquo;ll have somebody else to look after your washing long before
that - and if it wasn&rsquo;t for my dear children&rsquo;s sake I shouldn&rsquo;t
care how soon.&nbsp; You know my mind - and so, good-night, Mr. Caudle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thankful for her silence</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I
was fast dropping to sleep; when</i>,<i> jogging my elbow</i>,<i> my
wife observed - &lsquo;Mind</i>,<i> there&rsquo;s the cold mutton to-morrow
- nothing hot till that&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; Remember</i>,<i> too</i>,<i>
as it was a short wash to-day</i>,<i> we wash again on Wednesday</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE XVIII - CAUDLE, WHILST WALKING WITH HIS WIFE, HAS BEEN BOWED
TO BY A YOUNGER AND EVEN PRETTIER WOMAN THAN MRS. CAUDLE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not to leave the house without being insulted,
Mr. Caudle, I had better stay indoors all my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me to let you have <i>one</i>
night&rsquo;s rest!&nbsp; I wonder at your impudence!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
mighty fine, I never can go out with you and - goodness knows! - it&rsquo;s
seldom enough without having my feelings torn to pieces by people of
all sorts.&nbsp; A set of bold minxes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What am I raving about</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know very well - very well, indeed, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
A pretty person she must be to nod to a man walking with his own wife!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me that it&rsquo;s Miss Prettyman - what&rsquo;s Miss
Prettyman to me?&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve met her once or twice at her brother&rsquo;s
house</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say you have - no doubt of it.&nbsp; I always
thought there was something very tempting about that house - and now
I know it all.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s no use, Mr. Caudle, your beginning
to talk loud, and twist and toss your arms about as if you were as innocent
as a born babe - I&rsquo;m not to be deceived by such tricks now.&nbsp;
No; there was a time when I was a fool and believed anything; but -
I thank my stars! - I&rsquo;ve got over that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bold minx!&nbsp; You suppose I didn&rsquo;t see her laugh,
too, when she nodded to you!&nbsp; Oh yes, I knew what she thought me
- a poor miserable creature, of course.&nbsp; I could see that.&nbsp;
No - don&rsquo;t say so, Caudle.&nbsp; I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> always see
more than anybody else - but I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t be blind,
however agreeable it might be to you; I must have the use of my senses.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure, if a woman wants attention and respect from a man, she&rsquo;d
better be anything than his wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always thought so;
and to-day&rsquo;s decided it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not ashamed of myself to talk so - certainly
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A good</i>,<i> amiable young creature indeed</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I dare say; very amiable, no doubt.&nbsp; Of course,
you think her so.&nbsp; You suppose I didn&rsquo;t see what sort of
a bonnet she had on?&nbsp; Oh, a very good creature!&nbsp; And you think
I didn&rsquo;t see the smudges of court plaster about her face?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely; but I did.&nbsp; Very amiable, to be sure!&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I made her blush at my ill manners</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have liked to have seen her blush!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould
have been rather difficult, Mr. Caudle, for a blush to come through
all that paint.&nbsp; No - I&rsquo;m not a censorious woman, Mr. Caudle;
quite the reverse.&nbsp; No; and you may threaten to get up, if you
like - I will speak.&nbsp; I know what colour is, and I say it <i>was</i>
paint.&nbsp; I believe, Mr. Caudle, <i>I</i> once had a complexion -
though of course you&rsquo;ve quite forgotten that: I think I once had
a colour - before your conduct destroyed it.&nbsp; Before I knew you,
people used to call me the Lily and Rose; but - what are you laughing
at?&nbsp; I see nothing to laugh at.&nbsp; But as I say, anybody before
your own wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t walk out with you but you&rsquo;re bowed
to by every woman you meet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I mean by every woman</i>,<i> when it&rsquo;s only
Miss Prettyman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it.&nbsp; How do I
know who bows to you when I&rsquo;m not by?&nbsp; Everybody of course.&nbsp;
And if they don&rsquo;t look at you, why you look at them.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure you do.&nbsp; You do it even when I&rsquo;m out with
you, and of course you do it when I&rsquo;m away.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t
tell me, Caudle - don&rsquo;t deny it.&nbsp; The fact is, it&rsquo;s
become such a dreadful habit with you, that you don&rsquo;t know when
you do it, and when you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Prettyman, indeed!&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t lie still and hear me scandalise that excellent
young woman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you&rsquo;ll take her part!&nbsp; Though, to
be sure, she may not be so much to blame after all.&nbsp; For how is
she to know you&rsquo;re married?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re never seen out
of doors with your own wife - never.&nbsp; Wherever you go, you go alone.&nbsp;
Of course people think you&rsquo;re a bachelor.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You well know you&rsquo;re not</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it - I only ask, What must
people think, when I&rsquo;m never seen with you?&nbsp; Other women
go out with their husbands: but, as I&rsquo;ve often said, I&rsquo;m
not like any other woman.&nbsp; What are you sneering at, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How do I know you&rsquo;re sneering</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me: I know well enough, by the movement of
the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you never take me out - and you know it.&nbsp; No; and
it&rsquo;s not my own fault.&nbsp; How can you lie there and say that?&nbsp;
Oh, all a poor excuse!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you always say.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re tired of asking me, indeed, because I always start some
objection?&nbsp; Of course I can&rsquo;t go out a figure.&nbsp; And
when you ask me to go, you know very well that my bonnet isn&rsquo;t
as it should be - or that my gown hasn&rsquo;t come home - or that I
can&rsquo;t leave the children - or that something keeps me indoors.&nbsp;
You know all this well enough before you ask me.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
your art.&nbsp; And when I <i>do</i> go out with you, I&rsquo;m sure
to suffer for it.&nbsp; Yes, you needn&rsquo;t repeat my words.&nbsp;
<i>Suffer for it</i>.&nbsp; But you suppose I have no feelings: oh no,
nobody has feelings but yourself.&nbsp; Yes; I&rsquo;d forgot: Miss
Prettyman, perhaps - yes, she may have feelings, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as I&rsquo;ve said, I dare say a pretty dupe people think
me.&nbsp; To be sure; a poor forlorn creature I must look in everybody&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; But I knew you couldn&rsquo;t be at Mr. Prettyman&rsquo;s
house night after night till eleven o&rsquo;clock - and a great deal
you thought of me sitting up for you - I knew you couldn&rsquo;t be
there without some cause.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ve found it out!&nbsp;
Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind your swearing, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s I,
if I wasn&rsquo;t a woman, who ought to swear.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
like you men.&nbsp; Lords of the creation, as you call yourselves!&nbsp;
Lords, indeed!&nbsp; And pretty slaves you make of the poor creatures
who&rsquo;re tied to you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be separated, Caudle;
I will; and then I&rsquo;ll take care and let all the world know how
you&rsquo;ve used me.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I may say my worst</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t you tempt any woman in that way - don&rsquo;t,
Caudle; for I wouldn&rsquo;t answer for what I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Prettyman, indeed, and - oh yes! now I see!&nbsp; Now
the whole light breaks in upon me!&nbsp; Now I know why you wished me
to ask her with Mr. and Mrs. Prettyman to tea!&nbsp; And I, like a poor
blind fool, was nearly doing it.&nbsp; But now, as I say, my eyes are
open!&nbsp; And you&rsquo;d have brought her under my own roof - now
it&rsquo;s no use your bouncing about in that fashion - you&rsquo;d
have brought her into the very house, where - &rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Here</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I could endure
it no longer.&nbsp; So I jumped out of bed</i>,<i> and went and slept
somehow with the children</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE XIX - MRS. CAUDLE THINKS &ldquo;IT WOULD LOOK WELL TO KEEP
THEIR WEDDING-DAY.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, love, do you know what next Sunday is?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>!<i> you don&rsquo;t</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, was there ever such a strange man!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you guess, darling?&nbsp; Next Sunday, dear?&nbsp; Think, love, a minute
- just think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>!<i> and you don&rsquo;t know now</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! if I hadn&rsquo;t a better memory than you, I don&rsquo;t
know how we should ever get on.&nbsp; Well, then, pet, - shall I tell
you what next Sunday is?&nbsp; Why, then, it&rsquo;s our wedding-day
- What are you groaning at, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see anything
to groan at.&nbsp; If anybody should groan, I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t
you.&nbsp; No: I rather think it&rsquo;s I who ought to groan!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fourteen years ago.&nbsp; You
were a very different man then, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; What do you say -
?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And I was a very different woman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all - just the same.&nbsp; Oh, you needn&rsquo;t roll
your head about on the pillow in that way: I say, just the same.&nbsp;
Well, then, if I&rsquo;m altered, whose fault is it?&nbsp; Not mine,
I&rsquo;m sure - certainly not.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me that I couldn&rsquo;t
talk at all then - I could talk just as well then as I can now; only
then I hadn&rsquo;t the same cause.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ve
made me talk.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re very sorry for it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, you do nothing but insult me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you were a good-tempered, nice creature fourteen years
ago, and would have done anything for me.&nbsp; Yes, yes, if a woman
would be always cared for, she should never marry.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
quite an end of the charm when she goes to church!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
all angels while you&rsquo;re courting us; but once married, how soon
you pull our wings off!&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle, I&rsquo;m not talking
nonsense; but the truth is, you like to hear nobody talk but yourself.&nbsp;
Nobody ever tells me that I talk nonsense but you.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s
no use your turning and turning about in that way, it&rsquo;s not a
bit of - what do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll get up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t, Mr. Caudle; you&rsquo;ll not serve me
that trick again; for I&rsquo;ve locked the door and hid the key.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no getting hold of you all the day-time - but here you
can&rsquo;t leave me.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t groan again, Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle, dear, do let us talk comfortably.&nbsp; After
all, love, there&rsquo;s a good many folks who, I daresay, don&rsquo;t
get on half so well as we&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve both our
little tempers, perhaps; but you <i>are</i> aggravating; you must own
that, Caudle.&nbsp; Well, never mind; we won&rsquo;t talk of it; I won&rsquo;t
scold you now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll talk of next Sunday, love.&nbsp; We
never have kept our wedding-day, and I think it would be a nice day
to have our friends.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They&rsquo;d think it hypocrisy</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hypocrisy at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I try to be comfortable;
and if ever man was happy, you ought to be.&nbsp; No, Caudle, no; it
isn&rsquo;t nonsense to keep wedding-days; it isn&rsquo;t a deception
on the world; and if it is, how many people do it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s only a proper compliment that a man owes to his wife.&nbsp;
Look at the Winkles - don&rsquo;t they give a dinner every year?&nbsp;
Well, I know, and if they do fight a little in the course of the twelvemonth,
that&rsquo;s nothing to do with it.&nbsp; They keep their wedding-day,
and their acquaintance have nothing to do with anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I say, Caudle, it&rsquo;s only a proper compliment that
a man owes to his wife to keep his wedding-day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as
much as to say to the whole world - &lsquo;There! if I had to marry
again, my blessed wife&rsquo;s the only woman I&rsquo;d choose!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well!&nbsp; I see nothing to groan at, Mr. Caudle - no, nor to sigh
at either; but I know what you mean: I&rsquo;m sure, what would have
become of you if you hadn&rsquo;t married as you have done - why, you&rsquo;d
have been a lost creature!&nbsp; I know it; I know your habits, Caudle;
and - I don&rsquo;t like to say it, but you&rsquo;d have been little
better than a ragamuffin.&nbsp; Nice scrapes you&rsquo;d have got into,
I know, if you hadn&rsquo;t had me for a wife.&nbsp; The trouble I&rsquo;ve
had to keep you respectable - and what&rsquo;s my thanks?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;
I only wish you&rsquo;d had some women!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t quarrel, Caudle.&nbsp; No; you don&rsquo;t
mean anything, I know.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have this little dinner, eh?&nbsp;
Just a few friends?&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t say you don&rsquo;t care -
that isn&rsquo;t the way to speak to a wife; and especially the wife
I&rsquo;ve been to you, Caudle.&nbsp; Well, you agree to the dinner,
eh?&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t grunt, Mr. Caudle, but speak out.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
keep your wedding-day?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If I let you go to sleep</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s unmanly, Caudle.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you say
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; without anything else?&nbsp; I say - can&rsquo;t
you say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;?&nbsp; There, bless you!&nbsp; I knew you
would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Caudle, what shall we have for dinner?&nbsp; No -
we won&rsquo;t talk of it to-morrow; we&rsquo;ll talk of it now, and
then it will be off my mind.&nbsp; I should like something particular
- something out of the way - just to show that we thought the day something.&nbsp;
I should like - Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;re not asleep?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I want</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know I want to settle about the dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Have what I like</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: as it&rsquo;s your fancy to keep the day, it&rsquo;s only
right that I should try to please you.&nbsp; We never had one, Caudle;
so what do you think of a haunch of venison?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mutton will do</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that shows what you think of your wife: I dare say if
it was with any of your club friends - any of your pot-house companions
- you&rsquo;d have no objection to venison.&nbsp; I say if - what do
you mutter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Let it be venison</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; And now about the fish?&nbsp; What do you
think of a nice turbot?&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle, brill won&rsquo;t do -
it shall be turbot, or there sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be any fish at all.&nbsp;
Oh, what a mean man you are, Caudle!&nbsp; Shall it be turbot?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It shall</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; And now about the soup - now, Caudle, don&rsquo;t
swear at the soup in that manner; you know there must be soup.&nbsp;
Well, once in a way, and just to show our friends how happy we&rsquo;ve
been, we&rsquo;ll have some real turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No, you won&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have nothing but mock</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Caudle, you may sit at the table by yourself.&nbsp;
Mock-turtle on a wedding-day!&nbsp; Was there ever such an insult?&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Let it be real, then, for once</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, Caudle!&nbsp; As I say, you were a very different person
fourteen years ago.&nbsp; And, Caudle, you&rsquo;ll look after the venison?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a place I know, somewhere in the City, where you get it
beautiful!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll look to it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You will</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now who shall we invite?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who I like</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you know, Caudle, that&rsquo;s nonsense; because I only
like whom you like.&nbsp; I suppose the Prettymans must come?&nbsp;
But understand, Caudle, I don&rsquo;t have Miss Prettyman: I&rsquo;m
not going to have my peace of mind destroyed under my own roof! if she
comes, I don&rsquo;t appear at the table.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Very well</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well be it, then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Caudle, you&rsquo;ll not forget the venison?&nbsp;
In the City, my dear?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not forget the venison?&nbsp;
A haunch, you know; a nice haunch.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll not forget
the venison - ?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Three times did I fall off to sleep</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle,
&ldquo;<i>and three times did my wife nudge me with her elbow, exclaiming</i>
- &lsquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll not forget the venison</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>At
last I got into a sound slumber, and dreamt I was a pot of currant jelly</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XX - &ldquo;BROTHER&rdquo; CAUDLE HAS BEEN TO A MASONIC
CHARITABLE DINNER.&nbsp; MRS. CAUDLE HAS HIDDEN THE &ldquo;BROTHER&rsquo;S&rdquo;
CHEQUE-BOOK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;But all I say is this: I only wish I&rsquo;d been born a man.&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You wish I had</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Caudle, I&rsquo;ll not lie quiet in my own bed to be insulted.&nbsp;
Oh, yes, you <i>did</i> mean to insult me.&nbsp; I know what you mean.&nbsp;
You mean, if I <i>had</i> been born a man, you&rsquo;d never have married
me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a pretty sentiment, I think; and after the wife
I&rsquo;ve been to you.&nbsp; And now I suppose you&rsquo;ll be going
to public dinners every day!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use your telling me
you&rsquo;ve only been to one before; that&rsquo;s nothing to do with
it - nothing at all.&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;ll be out every night
now.&nbsp; I knew what it would come to when you were made a mason:
when you were once made a &lsquo;brother,&rsquo; as you call yourself,
I knew where the husband and father would be; - I&rsquo;m sure, Caudle,
and though I&rsquo;m your own wife, I grieve to say it - I&rsquo;m sure
you haven&rsquo;t so much heart that you have any to spare for people
out of doors.&nbsp; Indeed, I should like to see the man who has!&nbsp;
No, no, Caudle; I&rsquo;m by no means a selfish woman - quite the contrary;
I love my fellow-creatures as a wife and mother of a family, who has
only to look to her own husband and children, ought to love &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;brother,&rsquo; indeed!&nbsp; What would you say,
if I was to go and be made a &lsquo;sister&rsquo;?&nbsp; Why, I know
very well the house wouldn&rsquo;t hold you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your watch</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know where your watch is?&nbsp; You ought to
know.&nbsp; But to be sure, people who go to public dinners never know
where anything is when they come home.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve lost it, no
doubt; and &rsquo;twill serve you quite right if you have.&nbsp; If
it should be gone - and nothing more likely - I wonder if any of your
&lsquo;brothers&rsquo; will give you another?&nbsp; Catch &rsquo;em
doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You must find your watch</i>?<i>&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll
get up for it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! - don&rsquo;t be foolish - lie still.&nbsp; Your
watch is on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; Ha! isn&rsquo;t it a good thing for
you, you&rsquo;ve somebody to take care of it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m a dear creature</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very dear, indeed, you think me, I dare say.&nbsp; But the
fact is, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about to-night.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a fool to open my lips to you - but I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your watch</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you - on the mantelpiece?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>All right, indeed</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty conduct you men call all right.&nbsp; There now, hold
your tongue, Mr. Caudle, and go to sleep: I&rsquo;m sure &rsquo;tis
the best thing you can do to-night.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be able to listen
to reason to-morrow morning; now, it&rsquo;s thrown away upon you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your cheque-book</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind your cheque-book.&nbsp; I took care of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What business had I to take it out of your pocket</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every business.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; If you choose to go to
public dinners, why - as I&rsquo;m only your wife - I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; But I know what fools men are made of there; and if I know
it, you never take your cheque-book again with you.&nbsp; What?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t I see your name down last year for ten pounds?&nbsp; &lsquo;Job
Caudle, Esq., &pound;10.&rsquo;&nbsp; It looked very well in the newspapers,
of course: and you thought yourself a somebody, when they knocked the
tavern tables; but I only wish I&rsquo;d been there - yes, I only wish
I&rsquo;d been in the gallery.&nbsp; If I wouldn&rsquo;t have told a
piece of my mind, I&rsquo;m not alive.&nbsp; Ten pounds indeed! and
the world thinks you a very fine person for it.&nbsp; I only wish I
could bring the world here, and show &rsquo;em what&rsquo;s wanted at
home.&nbsp; I think the world would alter their mind then; yes - a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A wife has no right to pick her husband&rsquo;s pocket</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty husband you are, to talk in that way!&nbsp; Never
mind: you can&rsquo;t prosecute her for it - or I&rsquo;ve no doubt
you would; none at all.&nbsp; Some men would do anything.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve a bit of a headache</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you have - and a good bit, too.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
been to the right place for it.&nbsp; No - I won&rsquo;t hold my tongue.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all very well for you men to go to taverns - and talk - and
toast - and hurrah - and - I wonder you&rsquo;re not all ashamed of
yourselves to drink the Queen&rsquo;s health with all the honours, I
believe, you call it - yes, pretty honours you pay to the sex - I say,
I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed to drink that blessed creature&rsquo;s
health, when you&rsquo;ve only to think how you use your own wives at
home.&nbsp; But the hypocrites that the men are - oh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your watch</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s under your pillow
- there, you needn&rsquo;t be feeling for it.&nbsp; I tell you it&rsquo;s
under your pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s all right</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a great deal you know of what&rsquo;s right just now!&nbsp;
Ha! was there ever any poor soul used as I am!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m a dear creature</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only to say, I&rsquo;m
tired of your conduct - quite tired, and don&rsquo;t care how soon there&rsquo;s
an end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did I take your cheque-book</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you - to save you from ruin, Mr. Caudle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re not going to be ruined</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you don&rsquo;t know anything when you&rsquo;re out!&nbsp;
I know what they do at those public dinners - charities, they call &rsquo;em;
pretty charities!&nbsp; True Charity, I believe, always dines at home.&nbsp;
I know what they do: the whole system&rsquo;s a trick.&nbsp; No: <i>I&rsquo;m
not a stony-hearted creature</i>: and you ought to be ashamed to say
so of your wife and the mother of your children, - but you&rsquo;ll
not make me cry to-night, I can tell you - I was going to say that -
oh! you&rsquo;re such an aggravating man I don&rsquo;t know what I was
going to say!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thank Heaven</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything
to thank Heaven about!&nbsp; I was going to say, I know the trick of
public dinners.&nbsp; They get a lord, or a duke, if they can catch
him - anything to make people say they dined with nobility, that&rsquo;s
it - yes, they get one of these people, with a star perhaps in his coat,
to take the chair - and to talk all sorts of sugar-plum things about
charity - and to make foolish men, with wine in &rsquo;em, feel that
they&rsquo;ve no end of money; and then - shutting their eyes to their
wives and families at home - all the while that their own faces are
red and flushed like poppies, and they think to-morrow will never come
- then they get &rsquo;em to put their hand to paper.&nbsp; Then they
make &rsquo;em pull out their cheques.&nbsp; But I took your book, Mr.
Caudle - you couldn&rsquo;t do it a second time.&nbsp; What are you
laughing at?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nothing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter: I shall see it in the paper to-morrow;
for if you gave anything, you were too proud to hide it.&nbsp; I know
<i>your</i> charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your watch</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you fifty times where it is?&nbsp; In
the pocket - over your head - of course.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you hear
it tick?&nbsp; No: you can hear nothing to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Caudle, I should like to know whose hat you&rsquo;ve
brought home?&nbsp; You went out with a beaver worth three-and-twenty
shillings - the second time you&rsquo;ve worn it - and you bring home
a thing that no Jew in his senses would give me fivepence for.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t even get a pot of primroses - and you know I always
turn your old hats into roots - not a pot of primroses for it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m certain of it now - I&rsquo;ve often thought it - but now
I&rsquo;m sure that some people dine out only to change their hats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s your watch</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, you&rsquo;re bringing me to an early grave!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>We hope that Caudle was penitent for his conduct; indeed, there
is, we think, evidence that he was so: for to this lecture he has appended
no comment.&nbsp; The man had not the face to do it.</i></p>

<h2>LECTURE XXI - MR. CAUDLE HAS NOT ACTED &ldquo;LIKE A HUSBAND&rdquo;
AT THE WEDDING DINNER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use wishing - none at all: but
I do wish that yesterday fourteen years could come back again.&nbsp;
Little did I think, Mr. Caudle, when you brought me home from church,
your lawful wedded wife - little, I say, did I think that I should keep
my wedding dinner in the manner I have done to-day.&nbsp; Fourteen years
ago!&nbsp; Yes, I see you now, in your blue coat with bright buttons,
and your white watered-satin waistcoat, and a moss-rose bud in your
button-hole, which you said was like me.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never talked such nonsense</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle, you don&rsquo;t know what you talked
that day - but I do.&nbsp; Yes; and you then sat at the table as if
your face, as I may say, was buttered with happiness, and - What?&nbsp;
No, Mr. Caudle, don&rsquo;t say that; <i>I</i> have not wiped the butter
off - not I.&nbsp; If you above all men are not happy, you ought to
be, gracious knows!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>will</i> talk of fourteen years ago.&nbsp; Ha! you
sat beside me then, and picked out all sorts of nice things for me.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d have given me pearls and diamonds to eat if I could have
swallowed &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Yes, I say, you sat beside me, and - What
do you talk about?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You couldn&rsquo;t sit beside me to-day</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
so like you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t speak but you fly off to something
else.&nbsp; Ha! and when the health of the young couple was drunk, what
a speech you made then!&nbsp; It was delicious!&nbsp; How you made everybody
cry as if their hearts were breaking; and I recollect it as if it was
yesterday, how the tears ran down dear father&rsquo;s nose, and how
dear mother nearly went into a fit!&nbsp; Dear souls!&nbsp; They little
thought, with all your fine talk, how you&rsquo;d use me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How have you used me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Caudle, how can you ask that question?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
well for you I can&rsquo;t see you blush.&nbsp; <i>How</i> have you
used me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that the same tongue could make a speech like that,
and then talk as it did to-day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How did you talk</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, shamefully!&nbsp; What did you say about your wedded
happiness?&nbsp; Why, nothing.&nbsp; What did you say about your wife?&nbsp;
Worse than nothing: just as if she were a bargain you were sorry for,
but were obliged to make the best of.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And bad&rsquo;s the best</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say that again, Caudle, I&rsquo;ll rise from my bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t say it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, did you say?&nbsp; Something very like it, I know.&nbsp;
Yes, a pretty speech of thanks for a husband!&nbsp; And everybody could
see that you didn&rsquo;t care a pin for me; and that&rsquo;s why you
had &rsquo;em here: that&rsquo;s why you invited &rsquo;em, to insult
me to their faces.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I made you invite &rsquo;em</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caudle, what an aggravating man you are!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll say next I made you invite Miss Prettyman?&nbsp;
Oh yes; don&rsquo;t tell me that her brother brought her without you
knowing it.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Didn&rsquo;t I hear him say so</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did; but do you suppose I&rsquo;m quite a fool?&nbsp;
Do you think I don&rsquo;t know that that was all settled between you?&nbsp;
And she must be a nice person to come unasked to a woman&rsquo;s house?&nbsp;
But I know why she came.&nbsp; Oh yes; she came to look about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the meaning&rsquo;s plain enough. - She came to see how
she should like the rooms - how she should like my seat at the fireplace;
how she - and if it isn&rsquo;t enough to break a mother&rsquo;s heart
to be treated so! - how she should like my dear children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s no use your bouncing about at - but of course
that&rsquo;s it; I can&rsquo;t mention Miss Prettyman but you fling
about as if you were in a fit.&nbsp; Of course that shows there&rsquo;s
something in it.&nbsp; Otherwise, why should you disturb yourself?&nbsp;
Do you think I didn&rsquo;t see her looking at the ciphers on the spoons
as if she already saw mine scratched out and hers there?&nbsp; No, I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t drive you mad, Mr. Caudle; and if I do it&rsquo;s
your own fault.&nbsp; No other man would treat the wife of his bosom
in - What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You might as well have married a hedgehog</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now it&rsquo;s come to something!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
always the case!&nbsp; Whenever you&rsquo;ve seen that Miss Prettyman,
I&rsquo;m sure to be abused.&nbsp; A hedgehog!&nbsp; A pretty thing
for a woman to be called by her husband!&nbsp; Now you don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ll lie quietly in bed, and be called a hedgehog - do you, Mr.
Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only hope Miss Prettyman had a good dinner, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; I had none!&nbsp; You know I had none - how was I to get
any?&nbsp; You know that the only part of the turkey I care for is the
merry-thought.&nbsp; And that, of course, went to Miss Prettyman.&nbsp;
Oh, I saw you laugh when you put it on her plate!&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t
suppose, after such an insult as that, I&rsquo;d taste another thing
upon the table?&nbsp; No, I should hope I have more spirit than that.&nbsp;
Yes; and you took wine with her four times.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Only twice</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you were so lost - fascinated, Mr. Caudle; yes, fascinated
- that you didn&rsquo;t know what you did.&nbsp; However, I do think
while I&rsquo;m alive I might be treated with respect at my own table.&nbsp;
I say, while I&rsquo;m alive; for I know I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t last
long, and then Miss Prettyman may come and take it all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
wasting daily, and no wonder.&nbsp; I never say anything about it, but
every week my gowns are taken in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived to learn something, to be sure!&nbsp; Miss
Prettyman turned up her nose at my custards.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t sufficient
that you are always finding fault yourself, but you must bring women
home to sneer at me at my own table.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She didn&rsquo;t turn up her nose</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she did; not but what it&rsquo;s needless - Providence
has turned it up quite enough for her already.&nbsp; And she must give
herself airs over my custards!&nbsp; Oh, I saw her mincing with the
spoon as if she was chewing sand.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She praised my plum-pudding</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who asked her to praise it?&nbsp; Like her impudence, I think!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a pretty day I&rsquo;ve passed.&nbsp; I shall not forget
this wedding-day, I think!&nbsp; And as I say, a pretty speech you made
in the way of thanks.&nbsp; No, Caudle, if I was to live a hundred years
- you needn&rsquo;t groan, Mr. Caudle, I shall not trouble you half
that time - if I was to live a hundred years, I should never forget
it.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t even so much as bring one of
your children into your speech.&nbsp; And - dear creatures! - what have
<i>they</i> done to offend you?&nbsp; No; I shall not drive you mad.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s you, Mr. Caudle, who&rsquo;ll drive me mad.&nbsp; Everybody
says so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you suppose I didn&rsquo;t see how it was managed that
you and <i>that</i> Miss Prettyman were always partners at whist?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How was it managed</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, plain enough.&nbsp; Of course you packed the cards, and
could cut what you liked.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d settled that between you.&nbsp;
Yes; and when she took a trick, instead of leading off a trump - she
play whist, indeed! - what did you say to her, when she found it was
wrong?&nbsp; Oh - it was impossible that <i>her</i> heart should mistake!&nbsp;
And this, Mr. Caudle, before people - with your own wife in the room!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Prettyman - I won&rsquo;t hold my tongue.&nbsp; I
<i>will</i> talk of Miss Prettyman: who&rsquo;s she, indeed, that I
shouldn&rsquo;t talk of her?&nbsp; I suppose she thinks she sings?&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She sings like a mermaid</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very - very like a mermaid; for she never sings but she
exposes herself.&nbsp; She might, I think, have chosen another song.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>I love somebody</i>,&rsquo; indeed; as if I didn&rsquo;t know
who was meant by that &lsquo;somebody&rsquo;; and all the room knew
it, of course; and that was what it was done for, nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Mr. Caudle, as my mind&rsquo;s made up, I shall say
no more about the matter to-night, but try to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And to my astonishment and gratitude</i>,&rdquo; writes
Caudle, &ldquo;<i>she kept her word</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXII - CAUDLE COMES HOME IN THE EVENING, AS MRS. CAUDLE
HAS &ldquo;JUST STEPPED OUT, SHOPPING.&rdquo;&nbsp; ON HER RETURN, AT
TEN, CAUDLE REMONSTRATES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Caudle, you ought to have had a slave - yes, a black slave,
and not a wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;d better been born a negro
at once - much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s the matter now</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that.&nbsp; Upon my life, Mr. Caudle, that&rsquo;s
very cool.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t leave the house just to buy a yard of
riband, but you storm enough to carry the roof off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t storm</i>?<i> you only spoke</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoke, indeed!&nbsp; No, sir: I&rsquo;ve not such superfine
feelings; and I don&rsquo;t cry out before I&rsquo;m hurt.&nbsp; But
you ought to have married a woman of stone, for you feel for nobody:
that is, for nobody in your own house.&nbsp; I only wish you&rsquo;d
show some of your humanity at home, if ever so little - that&rsquo;s
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where&rsquo;s my feelings, to go shopping at night</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When would you have me go?&nbsp; In the broiling sun, making
my face like a gipsy&rsquo;s?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see anything to laugh
at, Mr. Caudle; but you think of anybody&rsquo;s face before your wife&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Oh, that&rsquo;s plain enough; and all the world can see it.&nbsp; I
dare say, now, if it was Miss Prettyman&rsquo;s face - now, now, Mr.
Caudle!&nbsp; What are you throwing yourself about for?&nbsp; I suppose
Miss Prettyman isn&rsquo;t so wonderful a person that she isn&rsquo;t
to be named?&nbsp; I suppose she&rsquo;s flesh and blood.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t know</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll have a separate room - you&rsquo;ll not be
tormented in this manner</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t, sir - not while I&rsquo;m alive.&nbsp;
A separate room!&nbsp; And you call yourself a religious man, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d advise you to take down the Prayer Book, and read over the
Marriage Service.&nbsp; A separate room, indeed!&nbsp; Caudle, you&rsquo;re
getting quite a heathen.&nbsp; A separate room!&nbsp; Well, the servants
would talk then!&nbsp; But no: no man - not the best that ever trod,
Caudle - should ever make me look so contemptible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> go to sleep; and you ought to
know me better than to ask me to hold my tongue.&nbsp; Because you come
home when I&rsquo;ve just stepped out to do a little shopping, you&rsquo;re
worse than a fury.&nbsp; I should like to know how many hours I sit
up for you?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nobody wants me to sit up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s like the gratitude of men - just like &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
But a poor woman can&rsquo;t leave the house, that - what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why can&rsquo;t I go at reasonable hours</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reasonable!&nbsp; What do you call eight o&rsquo;clock?&nbsp;
If I went out at eleven and twelve, as you come home, then you might
talk; but seven or eight o&rsquo;clock - why, it&rsquo;s the cool of
the evening; the nicest time to enjoy a walk; and, as I say, do a little
bit of shopping.&nbsp; Oh yes, Mr. Caudle, I do think of the people
that are kept in the shops just as much as you; but that&rsquo;s nothing
at all to do with it.&nbsp; I know what you&rsquo;d have.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
have all those young men let away early from the counter to improve
what you please to call their minds.&nbsp; Pretty notions you pick up
among a set of free-thinkers, and I don&rsquo;t know what!&nbsp; When
I was a girl, people never talked of minds - intellect, I believe you
call it.&nbsp; Nonsense! a new-fangled thing, just come up; and the
sooner it goes out, the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&nbsp; What are shops for, if they&rsquo;re
not to be open late and early too?&nbsp; And what are shopmen, if they&rsquo;re
not always to attend upon their customers?&nbsp; People pay for what
they have, I suppose, and aren&rsquo;t to be told when they shall come
and lay their money out, and when they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Thank
goodness! if one shop shuts, another keeps open; and I always think
it a duty I owe to myself to go to the shop that&rsquo;s open last:
it&rsquo;s the only way to punish the shopkeepers that are idle, and
give themselves airs about early hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s some things I like to buy best at candle-light.&nbsp;
Oh, don&rsquo;t talk to me about humanity!&nbsp; Humanity, indeed, for
a pack of tall, strapping young fellows - some of &rsquo;em big enough
to be shown for giants!&nbsp; And what have they to do?&nbsp; Why nothing,
but to stand behind a counter, and talk civility.&nbsp; Yes, I know
your notions; you say that everybody works too much: I know that.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d have all the world do nothing half its time but twiddle
its thumbs, or walk in the parks, or go to picture-galleries, and museums,
and such nonsense.&nbsp; Very fine, indeed; but, thank goodness! the
world isn&rsquo;t come to that pass yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say I am, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A foolish woman, that can&rsquo;t look beyond my own fireside</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I can; quite as far as you, and a great deal farther.&nbsp;
But I can&rsquo;t go out shopping a little with my dear friend Mrs.
Wittles - what do you laugh at?&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
women know what friendship is?&nbsp; Upon my life, you&rsquo;ve a nice
opinion of us!&nbsp; Oh yes, we can - we can look outside of our own
fenders, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; And if we can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s all the
better for our families.&nbsp; A blessed thing it would be for their
wives and children if men couldn&rsquo;t either.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t
have lent that five pounds - and I dare say a good many other five pounds
that I know nothing of - if you - a lord of the creation! - had half
the sense women have.&nbsp; You seldom catch us, I believe, lending
five pounds.&nbsp; I should think not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: we won&rsquo;t talk of it to-morrow morning.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
not going to wound my feelings when I come home, and think I&rsquo;m
to say nothing about it.&nbsp; You have called me an inhuman person;
you have said I have no thought, no feeling for the health and comfort
of my fellow-creatures; I don&rsquo;t know what you haven&rsquo;t called
me; and only for buying a - but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell you what;
no, I won&rsquo;t satisfy you there - but you&rsquo;ve abused me in
this manner, and only for shopping up to ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
a great deal of fine compassion, you have!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the
young man that served me could have knocked down an ox; yes, strong
enough to lift a house: but you can pity him - oh yes, you can be all
kindness for him, and for the world, as you call it.&nbsp; Oh, Caudle,
what a hypocrite you are!&nbsp; I only wish the world knew how you treated
your poor wife!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>For the love of mercy let you sleep</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, indeed!&nbsp; I wish you could show a little of it
to other people.&nbsp; Oh yes, I <i>do</i> know what mercy means; but
that&rsquo;s no reason I should go shopping a bit earlier than I do
- and I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No; you&rsquo;ve preached this over to me
again and again; you&rsquo;ve made me go to meetings to hear about it:
but that&rsquo;s no reason women shouldn&rsquo;t shop just as late as
they choose.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very fine, as I say, for you men to
talk to us at meetings, where, of course, we smile and all that - and
sometimes shake our white pocket-handkerchiefs - and where you say we
have the power of early hours in our own hands.&nbsp; To be sure we
have; and we mean to keep it.&nbsp; That is, I do.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
never catch me shopping till the very last thing; and - as a matter
of principle - I&rsquo;ll always go to the shop that keeps open latest.&nbsp;
It does the young men good to keep &rsquo;em close to business.&nbsp;
Improve their minds indeed!&nbsp; Let &rsquo;em out at seven, and they&rsquo;d
improve nothing but their billiards.&nbsp; Besides, if they want to
improve themselves, can&rsquo;t they get up, this fine weather, at three?&nbsp;
Where there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way, Mr. Caudle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I thought</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>that she
had gone to sleep.&nbsp; In this hope, I was dozing off when she jogged
me, and thus declared herself</i>: &lsquo;<i>Caudle, you want nightcaps;

<h2>LECTURE XXIII - MRS. CAUDLE &ldquo;WISHES TO KNOW IF THEY&rsquo;RE
GOING TO THE SEA-SIDE, OR NOT, THIS SUMMER - THAT&rsquo;S ALL&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hot?&nbsp; Yes, it <i>is</i> hot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure one
might as well be in an oven as in town this weather.&nbsp; You seem
to forget it&rsquo;s July, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been waiting
quietly - have never spoken; yet, not a word have you said of the seaside
yet.&nbsp; Not that I care for it myself - oh, no; my health isn&rsquo;t
of the slightest consequence.&nbsp; And, indeed, I was going to say
- but I won&rsquo;t - that the sooner, perhaps, I&rsquo;m out of this
world, the better.&nbsp; Oh, yes; I dare say you think so - of course
you do, else you wouldn&rsquo;t lie there saying nothing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
enough to aggravate a saint, Caudle; but you shan&rsquo;t vex me.&nbsp;
No; I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, and never intend to let you vex me again.&nbsp;
Why should I worry myself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all I want to ask you is this: do you intend to go to
the sea-side this summer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>?<i> you&rsquo;ll go to Gravesend</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll go alone, that&rsquo;s all I know.&nbsp;
Gravesend!&nbsp; You might as well empty a salt-cellar in the New River,
and call that the sea-side.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s handy for business</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are again!&nbsp; I can never speak of taking a little
enjoyment, but you fling business in my teeth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
you never let business stand in the way of your own pleasure, Mr. Caudle
- not you.&nbsp; It would be all the better for your family if you did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that Matilda wants sea-bathing; you know it, or ought
to know it, by the looks of the child; and yet - I know you, Caudle
- you&rsquo;d have let the summer pass over, and never said a word about
the matter.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Margate&rsquo;s so expensive</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it will be cheaper for us
in the end; for if we don&rsquo;t go, we shall all be ill - every one
of us - in the winter.&nbsp; Not that my health is of any consequence:
I know that well enough.&nbsp; It never was yet.&nbsp; You know Margate&rsquo;s
the only place I can eat a breakfast at, and yet you talk of Gravesend!&nbsp;
But what&rsquo;s my eating to you?&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t care if
I never ate at all.&nbsp; You never watch my appetite like any other
husband, otherwise you&rsquo;d have seen what it&rsquo;s come to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How much will it cost</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Mr. Caudle, with your meanness again.&nbsp;
When you want to go yourself to Blackwall or to Greenwich you never
ask, how much will it cost?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never go to Blackwall</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that; and if you don&rsquo;t,
that&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it.&nbsp; Yes, you can give a
guinea a plate for whitebait for yourself.&nbsp; No, sir: I&rsquo;m
not a foolish woman: and I know very well what I&rsquo;m talking about
- nobody better.&nbsp; A guinea for whitebait for yourself, when you
grudge a pint of shrimps for your poor family.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t grudge &rsquo;em anything</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very well for you to lie there and say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What will it cost</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter what it will cost, for we won&rsquo;t
go at all now.&nbsp; No; we&rsquo;ll stay at home.&nbsp; We shall all
be ill in the winter - every one of us, all but you; and nothing ever
makes you ill.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt we shall all be laid up, and
there&rsquo;ll be a doctor&rsquo;s bill as long as a railroad; but never
mind that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better - much better - to pay for nasty
physic than for fresh air and wholesome salt water.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
call me &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; and ask &lsquo;what it will cost.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I tell you, if you were to lay the money down before me on that quilt,
I wouldn&rsquo;t go now - certainly not.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better we
should all be sick; yes, then you&rsquo;ll be pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Caudle; go to sleep.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
like your unfeeling self!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking of our all being laid
up; and you, like any stone, turn round and begin to go to sleep.&nbsp;
Well, I think that&rsquo;s a pretty insult!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How can you sleep with such a splinter in your flesh</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean to call me the splinter? - and after the
wife I&rsquo;ve been to you!&nbsp; But no, Mr. Caudle, you may call
me what you please; you&rsquo;ll not make me cry now.&nbsp; No, no;
I don&rsquo;t throw away my tears upon any such person now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s your ingratitude!&nbsp; But none of you men
deserve that any woman should love you.&nbsp; My poor heart!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody else can go out of town except us.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;
If I&rsquo;d only married Simmons - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why didn&rsquo;t I</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all the thanks I get.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s Simmons</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know very well who Simmons is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have
treated me a little better, I think.&nbsp; He <i>was</i> a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You can&rsquo;t tell</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be not: but I can.&nbsp; With such weather as this, to
stay melting in London; and when the painters are coming in!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t have the painters in</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must; and if they once come in, I&rsquo;m determined
that none of us shall stir then.&nbsp; Painting in July, with a family
in the house!&nbsp; We shall all be poisoned, of course; but what do
you care for that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why can&rsquo;t I tell you what it will cost</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I or any woman tell exactly what it will cost?&nbsp;
Of course lodgings - and at Margate, too - are a little dearer than
living at your own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pooh</i>!<i>&nbsp; You know that</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you did, Mr. Caudle, I suppose there&rsquo;s no treason
in naming it.&nbsp; Still, if you take &rsquo;em for two months, they&rsquo;re
cheaper than for one.&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle, I shall not be quite tired
of it in one month.&nbsp; No: and it isn&rsquo;t true that I no sooner
get out than I want to get home again.&nbsp; To be sure, I was tired
of Margate three years ago, when you used to leave me to walk about
the beach by myself, to be stared at through all sorts of telescopes.&nbsp;
But you don&rsquo;t do that again, Mr. Caudle, I can tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What will I do at Margate</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t there bathing, and picking up shells; and
aren&rsquo;t there the packets, with the donkeys; and the last new novel,
whatever it is, to read? - for the only place where I really relish
a book is at the sea-side.&nbsp; No; it isn&rsquo;t that I like salt
with my reading, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; I suppose you call that a joke?&nbsp;
You might keep your jokes for the daytime, I think.&nbsp; But as I was
saying - only you always will interrupt me - the ocean always seems
to me to open the mind.&nbsp; I see nothing to laugh at; but you always
laugh when I say anything.&nbsp; Sometimes at the sea-side - especially
when the tide&rsquo;s down - I feel so happy: quite as if I could cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I get the things ready?&nbsp; For next Sunday?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What will it cost</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there - don&rsquo;t talk of it.&nbsp; No: we won&rsquo;t
go.&nbsp; I shall send for the painters to-morrow.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I can go and take the children, and you&rsquo;ll stay</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir: you go with me, or I don&rsquo;t stir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not going to be turned loose like a hen with her chickens, and nobody
to protect me.&nbsp; So we&rsquo;ll go on Monday?&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What will it cost</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a man you are!&nbsp; Why, Caudle, I&rsquo;ve been reckoning
that, with buff slippers and all, we can&rsquo;t well do it under seventy
pounds.&nbsp; No; I won&rsquo;t take away the slippers and say fifty.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s seventy pounds and no less.&nbsp; Of course, what&rsquo;s
over will be so much saved.&nbsp; Caudle, what a man you are!&nbsp;
Well, shall we go on Monday?&nbsp; What do you say -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll see</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dear.&nbsp; Then, Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anything for a chance of peace</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>I consented to the trip, for I thought I might sleep better
in a change of bed</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXIV - MRS. CAUDLE DWELLS ON CAUDLE&rsquo;S &ldquo;CRUEL
NEGLECT&rdquo; OF HER ON BOARD THE &ldquo;RED ROVER.&rdquo;&nbsp; MRS.
CAUDLE SO &ldquo;ILL WITH THE SEA,&rdquo; THAT THEY PUT UP AT THE DOLPHIN,
HERNE BAY.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, have you looked under the bed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What for</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the man!&nbsp; Why, for thieves, to be sure.&nbsp; Do
you suppose I&rsquo;d sleep in a strange bed without?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell me it&rsquo;s nonsense!&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink all
night.&nbsp; Not that you&rsquo;d care for that; not that you&rsquo;d
- hush!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I heard somebody.&nbsp; No; it&rsquo;s
not a bit like a mouse.&nbsp; Yes; that&rsquo;s like you - laugh.&nbsp;
It would be no laughing matter if - I&rsquo;m sure there <i>is</i> somebody!
- I&rsquo;m sure there is!</p>
<p>&ldquo; - Yes, Mr. Caudle; now I <i>am</i> satisfied.&nbsp; Any other
man would have got up and looked himself; especially after my sufferings
on board that nasty ship.&nbsp; But catch you stirring!&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d let me lie here and be robbed and killed, for what you&rsquo;d
care.&nbsp; Why you&rsquo;re not going to sleep?&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s the strange air - and you&rsquo;re always sleepy
in a strange air</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows the feelings you have, after what I&rsquo;ve gone
through.&nbsp; And yawning, too, in that brutal manner!&nbsp; Caudle,
you&rsquo;ve no more heart than that wooden figure in a white petticoat
at the front of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> leave my temper at home.&nbsp;
I dare say!&nbsp; Because for once in your life you&rsquo;ve brought
me out - yes, I say once, or two or three times, it isn&rsquo;t more;
because, as I say, you once bring me out, I&rsquo;m to be a slave and
say nothing.&nbsp; Pleasure, indeed!&nbsp; A great deal of pleasure
I&rsquo;m to have, if I&rsquo;m told to hold my tongue.&nbsp; A nice
way that of pleasing a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! if the bed doesn&rsquo;t spin round and dance about!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got all that filthy ship in my head!&nbsp; No: I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
be well in the morning.&nbsp; But nothing ever ails anybody but yourself.&nbsp;
You needn&rsquo;t groan in that way, Mr. Caudle, disturbing the people,
perhaps, in the next room.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mercy I&rsquo;m alive,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; If once I wouldn&rsquo;t have given all the world
for anybody to have thrown me overboard!&nbsp; What are you smacking
your lips at, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; But I know what you mean - of course,
you&rsquo;d never have stirred to stop &rsquo;em; not you.&nbsp; And
then you might have known that the wind would have blown to-day; but
that&rsquo;s why you came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I should have done if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that
good soul - that blessed Captain Large!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure all the
women who go to Margate ought to pray for him; so attentive in sea-sickness,
and so much of a gentleman!&nbsp; How I should have got down stairs
without him when I first began to turn, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell me I never complained to you; you might have seen I was ill.&nbsp;
And when everybody was looking like a bad wax-candle, you could walk
about, and make what you call your jokes upon the little buoy that was
never sick at the Nore, and such unfeeling trash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Caudle; we&rsquo;ve now been married many years, but
if we were to live together for a thousand years to come - what are
you clasping your hands at? - a thousand years to come, I say, I shall
never forget your conduct this day.&nbsp; You could go to the other
end of the ship and smoke a cigar, when you knew I should be ill - oh,
you knew it; for I always am.&nbsp; The brutal way, too, in which you
took that cold brandy-and-water - you thought I didn&rsquo;t see you;
but ill as I was, hardly able to hold my head up, I was watching you
all the time.&nbsp; Three glasses of cold brandy-and-water; and you
sipped &rsquo;em, and drank the health of people who you didn&rsquo;t
care a pin about; whilst the health of your own lawful wife was nothing.&nbsp;
Three glasses of brandy-and-water, and <i>I</i> left - as I may say
- alone!&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em, but everybody was crying
shame of you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A good deal my own fault</i>?<i>&nbsp; I took too much
dinner</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a man!&nbsp; If I took more than the breast
and leg of that young goose - a thing, I may say, just out of the shell
- with the slightest bit of stuffing, I&rsquo;m a wicked woman.&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Lobster salad</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;La! - how can you speak of it?&nbsp; A month-old baby would
have eaten more.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gooseberry pie</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll name that you&rsquo;ll name anything.&nbsp;
Ate too much indeed!&nbsp; Do you think I was going to pay for a dinner,
and eat nothing?&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle; it&rsquo;s a good thing for you
that I know a little more of the value of money than that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course, you were better engaged than in attending
to me.&nbsp; Mr. Prettyman came on board at Gravesend.&nbsp; A planned
thing, of course.&nbsp; You think I didn&rsquo;t see him give you a
letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It wasn&rsquo;t a letter; it was a newspaper</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay; ill as I was, I had my eyes.&nbsp; It was the smallest
newspaper I ever saw, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But of course, a letter
from Miss Prettyman - Now, Caudle, if you begin to cry out in that manner,
I&rsquo;ll get up.&nbsp; Do you forget that you are not at your own
house? making that noise!&nbsp; Disturbing everybody!&nbsp; Why, we
shall have the landlord up!&nbsp; And you could smoke and drink &lsquo;forward,&rsquo;
as you called it.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You couldn&rsquo;t smoke anywhere else</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Yes; forward.&nbsp;
What a pity that Miss Prettyman wasn&rsquo;t with you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure nothing could be too forward for her.&nbsp; No, I won&rsquo;t hold
my tongue; and I ought not to be ashamed of myself.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
treason, is it, to speak of Miss Prettyman?&nbsp; After all I&rsquo;ve
suffered to-day, and I&rsquo;m not to open my lips!&nbsp; Yes; I&rsquo;m
to be brought away from my own home, dragged down here to the sea-side,
and made ill! and I&rsquo;m not to speak.&nbsp; I should like to know
what next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy some of the dear children were not drowned;
not that their father would have cared, so long as he could have had
his brandy and cigars.&nbsp; Peter was as near through one of the holes
as -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s no such thing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well for you to say so, but you know what
an inquisitive boy he is, and how he likes to wander among steam-engines.&nbsp;
No, I won&rsquo;t let you sleep.&nbsp; What a man you are!&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve said that before</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no matter; I&rsquo;ll say it again.&nbsp; Go
to sleep, indeed! as if one could never have a little rational conversation.&nbsp;
No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be too late for the Margate boat in the morning;
I can wake up at what hour I like, and you ought to know that by this
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miserable creature they must have thought me in the ladies&rsquo;
cabin, with nobody coming down to see how I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You came a dozen times</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caudle, that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp;
You never came at all.&nbsp; Oh, no! cigars and brandy took all your
attention.&nbsp; And when I was so ill, that I didn&rsquo;t know a single
thing that was going on about me, and you never came.&nbsp; Every other
woman&rsquo;s husband was there - ha! twenty times.&nbsp; And what must
have been my feelings to hear &rsquo;em tapping at the door, and making
all sorts of kind inquiries - something like husbands and I was left
to be ill alone?&nbsp; Yes; and you want to get me into an argument.&nbsp;
You want to know, if I was so ill that I knew nothing, how could I know
that you didn&rsquo;t come to the cabin-door?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just
like your aggravating way; but I&rsquo;m not to be caught in that manner,
Caudle.&nbsp; No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It is very possible</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>that
she talked two hours more, but, happily, the wind got suddenly up -
the waves bellowed - and, soothed by the sweet lullaby (to say nothing
of the Dolphin&rsquo;s brandy-and-water) I somehow sank to repose</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me! aren&rsquo;t you tired, Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, was there ever such a man!&nbsp; But nothing ever tires
you.&nbsp; Of course, it&rsquo;s all very well for you: yes, you can
read your newspapers and - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>So can I</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wonder what would become of the children if I did!&nbsp;
No; it&rsquo;s enough for their father to lose his precious time, talking
about politics, and bishops, and lords, and a pack of people who wouldn&rsquo;t
care a pin if we hadn&rsquo;t a roof to cover us - it&rsquo;s well enough
for - no, Caudle, no: I&rsquo;m not going to worry you; I never worried
you yet, and it isn&rsquo;t likely I should begin now.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
always the way with you - always.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we should be
the happiest couple alive, only you do so like to have all the talk
to yourself.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re out upon pleasure, and therefore let&rsquo;s
be comfortable.&nbsp; Still, I must say it: when you like, you&rsquo;re
an aggravating man, Caudle, and you know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What have you done now</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now; we won&rsquo;t talk of it.&nbsp; No; let&rsquo;s
go to sleep: otherwise we shall quarrel - I know we shall.&nbsp; What
have you done, indeed!&nbsp; That I can&rsquo;t leave my home for a
few days, but I must be insulted!&nbsp; Everybody upon the pier saw
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saw what</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you lie there in the bed and ask me?&nbsp; Saw what,
indeed!&nbsp; Of course it was a planned thing! - regularly settled
before you left London.&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; I like your innocence, Mr.
Caudle; not knowing what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
heart-breaking thing for a woman to say of her own husband; but you&rsquo;ve
been a wicked man to me.&nbsp; Yes: and all your tossing and tumbling
about in the bed won&rsquo;t make it any better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to call a woman &lsquo;a dear soul.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I must be very dear, indeed, to you, when you bring down Miss Prettyman
to - there now; you needn&rsquo;t shout like a wild savage.&nbsp; Do
you know that you&rsquo;re not in your own house - do you know that
we&rsquo;re in lodgings?&nbsp; What do you suppose the people will think
of us?&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t call out in that manner, for they can
hear every word that&rsquo;s said.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why don&rsquo;t I hold my tongue then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure; anything for an excuse with you.&nbsp; Anything
to stop my mouth.&nbsp; Miss Prettyman&rsquo;s to follow you here, and
I&rsquo;m to say nothing.&nbsp; I know she <i>has</i> followed you;
and if you were to go before a magistrate, and take a shilling oath
to the contrary, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe you.&nbsp; No, Caudle; I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Very well, then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what a heart you must have, to say &lsquo;very well&rsquo;;
and after the wife I&rsquo;ve been to you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to be brought
from my own home - dragged down here to the sea-side - to be laughed
at before the world - don&rsquo;t tell me.&nbsp; Do you think I didn&rsquo;t
see how she looked at you - how she puckered up her farthing mouth -
and - what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did I kiss her, then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to do with it?&nbsp; Appearances are one
thing, Mr. Caudle; and feelings are another.&nbsp; As if women can&rsquo;t
kiss one another without meaning anything by it!&nbsp; And you - I could
see you looked as cold and as formal at her as - well, Caudle!&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t be the hypocrite you are for the world!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now; I&rsquo;ve heard all that story.&nbsp; I daresay
she did come down to join her brother.&nbsp; How very lucky, though,
that you should be here!&nbsp; Ha! ha! how very lucky that - ugh! ugh!
ugh! and with the cough I&rsquo;ve got upon me - oh, you&rsquo;ve a
heart like a sea-side flint!&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
just like your humanity.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t catch a cold, but it must
be my own fault - it must be my thin shoes.&nbsp; I daresay you&rsquo;d
like to see me in ploughman&rsquo;s boots; &rsquo;twould be no matter
to you how I disfigured myself.&nbsp; Miss Prettyman&rsquo;s foot, <i>now</i>,
would be another thing - no doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought when you would make me leave home - I thought we
were coming here on pleasure: but it&rsquo;s always the way you embitter
my life.&nbsp; The sooner that I&rsquo;m out of the world the better.&nbsp;
What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nothing</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what you mean, better than if you talked an hour.&nbsp;
I only hope you&rsquo;ll get a better wife, that&rsquo;s all, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;d not try</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I know you.&nbsp; In six months
you&rsquo;d fill up my place; yes, and dreadfully my dear children would
suffer for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, if you roar in that way, the people will give us warning
to-morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can&rsquo;t I be quiet, then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes - that&rsquo;s like your artfulness: anything to make
me hold my tongue.&nbsp; But we won&rsquo;t quarrel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure if it depended upon me, we might be as happy as doves.&nbsp; I
mean it - and you needn&rsquo;t groan when I say it.&nbsp; Good-night,
Caudle.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bless me</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a dear soul, Caudle; and if it wasn&rsquo;t
for that Miss Prettyman - no, I&rsquo;m not torturing you.&nbsp; I know
very well what I&rsquo;m doing, and I wouldn&rsquo;t torture you for
the world; but you don&rsquo;t know what the feelings of a wife are,
Caudle; you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle - I say, Caudle.&nbsp; Just a word, dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Well</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, why should you snap me up in that way?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You want to go to sleep</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I; but that&rsquo;s no reason you should speak to me
in that manner.&nbsp; You know, dear, you once promised to take me to
France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t recollect it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes - that&rsquo;s like you; you don&rsquo;t recollect many
things you&rsquo;ve promised me; but I do.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a boat
goes on Wednesday to Boulogne, and comes back the day afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for that time we could leave the children with the girls,
and go nicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nonsense</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; if I want anything it&rsquo;s always nonsense.&nbsp;
Other men can take their wives half over the world; but you think it
quite enough to bring me down here to this hole of a place, where I
know every pebble on the beach like an old acquaintance - where there&rsquo;s
nothing to be seen but the same machines - the same jetty - the same
donkeys - the same everything.&nbsp; But then, I&rsquo;d forgot; Margate
has an attraction for you - Miss Prettyman&rsquo;s here.&nbsp; No; I&rsquo;m
not censorious, and I wouldn&rsquo;t backbite an angel; but the way
in which that young woman walks the sands at all hours - there! there!
- I&rsquo;ve done: I can&rsquo;t open my lips about that creature but
you always storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I always wanted to go to France; and you bring
me down here only on purpose that I should see the French cliffs - just
to tantalise me, and for nothing else.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d remained at
home - and it was against my will I ever came here - I should never
have thought of France; but - to have it staring in one&rsquo;s face
all day, and not be allowed to go! it&rsquo;s worse than cruel, Mr.
Caudle - it&rsquo;s brutal.&nbsp; Other people can take their wives
to Paris; but you always keep me moped up at home.&nbsp; And what for?&nbsp;
Why, that I may know nothing - yes; just on purpose to make me look
little, and for nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Heaven bless the woman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you&rsquo;ve good reason to say that, Mr. Caudle; for
I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s little blessed by you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
been kept a prisoner all her life - has never gone anywhere - oh yes!
that&rsquo;s your old excuse, - talking of the children.&nbsp; I want
to go to France, and I should like to know what the children have to
do with it?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not babies <i>now</i> - are they?&nbsp;
But you&rsquo;ve always thrown the children in my face.&nbsp; If Miss
Prettyman - there now; do you hear what you&rsquo;ve done - shouting
in that manner?&nbsp; The other lodgers are knocking overhead: who do
you think will have the face to look at &rsquo;em to-morrow morning?&nbsp;
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t - breaking people&rsquo;s rest in that way!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Caudle - I declare it&rsquo;s getting daylight, and
what an obstinate man you are! - tell me, shall I go to France?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I forget</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>my precise
answer; but I think I gave her a very wide permission to go somewhere,
whereupon, though not without remonstrance as to the place - she went
to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXVI - MRS. CAUDLE&rsquo;S FIRST NIGHT IN FRANCE - &ldquo;SHAMEFUL
INDIFFERENCE&rdquo; OF CAUDLE AT THE BOULOGNE CUSTOM HOUSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Mr. Caudle, you call yourself a man?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure such men should never have wives.&nbsp; If I could have thought
it possible you&rsquo;d have behaved as you have done - and I might,
if I hadn&rsquo;t been a forgiving creature, for you&rsquo;ve never
been like anybody else - if I could only have thought it, you&rsquo;d
never have dragged me to foreign parts.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Well, I <i>did</i>
say to myself, if he goes to France, perhaps he may catch a little politeness
- but no; you began as Caudle, and as Caudle you&rsquo;ll end.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m to be neglected through life, now.&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
quite given up all thoughts of anything but wretchedness - I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind to misery, now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re glad of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must have a heart to say that.&nbsp; I declare to
you, Caudle, as true as I&rsquo;m an ill-used woman, if it wasn&rsquo;t
for the dear children far away in blessed England - if it wasn&rsquo;t
for them, I&rsquo;d never go back with you.&nbsp; No: I&rsquo;d leave
you in this very place.&nbsp; Yes; I&rsquo;d go into a convent; for
a lady on board told me there was plenty of &rsquo;em here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
go and be a nun for the rest of my days, and - I see nothing to laugh
at, Mr. Caudle; that you should be shaking the bed-things up and down
in that way.&nbsp; But you always laugh at people&rsquo;s feelings;
I wish you&rsquo;d only some yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be a nun, or
a Sister of Charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Impossible</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle, you don&rsquo;t know even now what I
can be when my blood&rsquo;s up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve trod upon the worm
long enough; some day won&rsquo;t you be sorry for it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, none of your profane cryings out!&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
talk about Heaven in that way: I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re the last
person who ought.&nbsp; What I say is this.&nbsp; Your conduct at the
Custom House was shameful - cruel!&nbsp; And in a foreign land, too!&nbsp;
But you brought me here that I might be insulted; you&rsquo;d no other
reason for dragging me from England.&nbsp; Ha! let me once get home,
Mr. Caudle, and you may wear your tongue out before you get me into
outlandish places again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What have you done</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now; that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re so aggravating.&nbsp;
You behave worse than any Turk to me, - what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You wish you were a Turk</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that&rsquo;s a pretty wish before your lawful
wife!&nbsp; Yes - a nice Turk you&rsquo;d make, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t think it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What have you done</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing I can&rsquo;t see you, for I&rsquo;m
sure you must blush.&nbsp; Done, indeed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when the brutes searched my basket at the Custom House!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A regular thing, is it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you knew that, why did you bring me here?&nbsp; No
man who respected his wife would.&nbsp; And you could stand by, and
see that fellow with mustachios rummage my basket; and pull out my night-cap
and rumple the borders, and - well! if you&rsquo;d had the proper feelings
of a husband, your blood would have boiled again.&nbsp; But no!&nbsp;
There you stood looking as mild as butter at the man, and never said
a word; not when he crumpled my night-cap - it went to my heart like
a stab - crumpled it as if it were any duster.&nbsp; I dare say if it
had been Miss Prettyman&rsquo;s night-cap - oh, I don&rsquo;t care about
your groaning - if it had been her night-cap, her hair-brush her curl-papers,
you&rsquo;d have said something then.&nbsp; Oh, anybody with the spirit
of a man would have spoken out if the fellow had had a thousand swords
at his side.&nbsp; Well, all I know is this: if I&rsquo;d have married
somebody I could name, he wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered me to be treated
in that way, not he!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t hope to go to sleep, Mr. Caudle, and think
to silence me in that manner.&nbsp; I know your art, but it won&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t enough that my basket was turned topsy-turvy,
but before I knew it, they spun me into another room, and -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How could you help that</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never tried to help it.&nbsp; No; although it was a foreign
land, and I don&rsquo;t speak French - not but what I know a good deal
more of it than some people who give themselves airs about it - though
I don&rsquo;t speak their nasty gibberish, still you let them take me
away, and never cared how I was ever to find you again.&nbsp; In a strange
country, too!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve no doubt that that&rsquo;s what you
wished: yes, you&rsquo;d have been glad enough to have got rid of me
in that cowardly manner.&nbsp; If I could only know your secret thoughts,
Caudle, that&rsquo;s what you brought me here for, to lose me.&nbsp;
And after the wife I&rsquo;ve been to you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you crying out?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>For mercy&rsquo;s sake</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a great deal you know about mercy!&nbsp; Else you&rsquo;d
never have suffered me to be twisted into that room.&nbsp; To be searched,
indeed!&nbsp; As if I&rsquo;d anything smuggled about me.&nbsp; Well,
I will say it, after the way in which I&rsquo;ve been used, if you&rsquo;d
the proper feelings of a man, you wouldn&rsquo;t sleep again for six
months.&nbsp; Well, I know there was nobody but women there; but that&rsquo;s
nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, if I&rsquo;d been taken
up for picking pockets, they couldn&rsquo;t have used me worse.&nbsp;
To be treated so - and &rsquo;specially by one&rsquo;s own sex! - it&rsquo;s
<i>that</i> that aggravates me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all you can say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What could you do</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, break open the door; I&rsquo;m sure you must have heard
my voice: you shall never make me believe you couldn&rsquo;t hear that.&nbsp;
Whenever I shall sew the strings on again, I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;
If they didn&rsquo;t turn me out like a ship in a storm, I&rsquo;m a
sinner!&nbsp; And you laughed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t laugh</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me; you laugh when you don&rsquo;t know anything
about it; but I do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty place you have brought me to!&nbsp; A most respectable
place, I must say!&nbsp; Where the women walk about without any bonnets
to their heads, and the fish-girls with their bare legs - well, you
don&rsquo;t catch me eating any fish while I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why not</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, - do you think I&rsquo;d encourage people of that
sort?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Good-night</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your saying that - I can&rsquo;t go to sleep
so soon as you can.&nbsp; Especially with a door that has such a lock
as that to it.&nbsp; How do we know who may come in?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>All the locks are bad in France</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more shame for you to bring me to such a place, then.&nbsp;
It only shows how you value me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dare say you are tired.&nbsp; I am!&nbsp; But then,
see what I&rsquo;ve gone through.&nbsp; Well, we won&rsquo;t quarrel
in a barbarous country.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp; Caudle,
dear, - what&rsquo;s the French for lace?&nbsp; I know it, only I forget
it.&nbsp; The French for lace, love?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dentelle</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re not deceiving me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never deceived me yet</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t a married
man in this blessed world can put his hand upon his heart in bed and
say that.&nbsp; French for lace, dear?&nbsp; Say it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dentelle</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Dentelle!&nbsp; Good-night, dear.&nbsp; Dentelle!&nbsp;
Den-telle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I afterwards</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>found
out to my cost wherefore she inquired about lace.&nbsp; For she went
out in the morning with the landlady to buy a veil, giving only four
pounds for what she could have bought in England for forty shillings</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXVII - MRS. CAUDLE RETURNS TO HER NATIVE LAND.&nbsp; &ldquo;UNMANLY
CRUELTY&rdquo; OF CAUDLE, WHO HAS REFUSED &ldquo;TO SMUGGLE A FEW THINGS&rdquo;
FOR HER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There, it isn&rsquo;t often that I ask you to do anything
for me, Mr. Caudle, goodness knows! and when I do, I&rsquo;m always
refused - of course.&nbsp; Oh yes! anybody but your own lawful wife.&nbsp;
Every other husband aboard the boat could behave like a husband - but
I was left to shift for myself.&nbsp; To be sure, that&rsquo;s nothing
new; I always am.&nbsp; Every other man, worthy to be called a man,
could smuggle a few things for his wife - but I might as well be alone
in the world.&nbsp; Not one poor half-dozen of silk stockings could
you put in your hat for me; and everybody else was rolled in lace, and
I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; What, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I want with silk stockings</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well - it&rsquo;s come to something now!&nbsp; There was a
time, I believe, when I had a foot - yes, and an ankle, too; but when
once a woman&rsquo;s married, she has nothing of the sort; of course.&nbsp;
No: I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> a cherub, Mr. Caudle; don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp;
I know very well what I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say now, you&rsquo;d have been delighted to smuggle
for Miss Prettyman?&nbsp; Silk stockings become her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You wish Miss Prettyman was in the moon</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you, Mr. Caudle; that&rsquo;s only your art - your hypocrisy.&nbsp;
A nice person too she&rsquo;d be for the moon: it would be none the
brighter for her being in it, I know.&nbsp; And when you saw the Custom
House officers look at me, as though they were piercing me through,
what was your conduct?&nbsp; Shameful.&nbsp; You twittered about and
fidgeted, and flushed up as if I really <i>was</i> a smuggler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>So I was</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had that to do with it?&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the part
of a husband, I think, to fidget in that way, and show it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You couldn&rsquo;t help it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&nbsp; And you call yourself a person of strong mind,
I believe?&nbsp; One of the lords of the creation!&nbsp; Ha! ha! couldn&rsquo;t
help it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I may do all I can to save the money, and this is always
my reward.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Caudle; I shall save a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How much</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell you: I know your meanness - you&rsquo;d
want to stop it out of the house allowance.&nbsp; No: it&rsquo;s nothing
to you where I got the money from to buy so many things.&nbsp; The money
was my own.&nbsp; Well, and if it was yours first, that&rsquo;s nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; No; I haven&rsquo;t saved it out of the puddings.&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s always the woman who saves who&rsquo;s despised.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only your fine-lady wives who&rsquo;re properly thought of.&nbsp;
If I was to ruin you, Caudle, then you&rsquo;d think something of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to sleep.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very well
for you, who&rsquo;re no sooner in bed than you&rsquo;re fast as a church;
but I can&rsquo;t sleep in that way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my mind keeps
me awake.&nbsp; And after all, I do feel so happy to-night, it&rsquo;s
very hard I can&rsquo;t enjoy my thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No: I can&rsquo;t think in silence</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s much enjoyment in that, to be sure!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
no doubt now you could listen to Miss Prettyman - oh, I don&rsquo;t
care, I will speak.&nbsp; It was a little more than odd, I think, that
she should be on the jetty when the boat came in.&nbsp; Ha! she&rsquo;d
been looking for you all the morning with a telescope, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt - she&rsquo;s bold enough for anything.&nbsp; And then how she
sneered and giggled when she saw me, - and said &lsquo;how fat I&rsquo;d
got:&rsquo; like her impudence, I think.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Well she might</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what she wanted; yes - she&rsquo;d have liked to
have had me searched.&nbsp; She laughed on purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I&rsquo;d taken two of the dear girls with me.&nbsp;
What things I could have stitched about &rsquo;em!&nbsp; No - I&rsquo;m
not ashamed of myself to make my innocent children smugglers: the more
innocent they looked, the better; but there you are with what you call
your principles again; as if it wasn&rsquo;t given to everybody by nature
to smuggle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure of it - it&rsquo;s born with us.&nbsp;
And nicely I&rsquo;ve cheated &rsquo;em this day.&nbsp; Lace, and velvet,
and silk stockings, and other things, - to say nothing of the tumblers
and decanters.&nbsp; No: I didn&rsquo;t look as if I wanted a direction,
for fear somebody should break me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s another of what
you call your jokes; but you should keep &rsquo;em for those who like
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What have I made, after all</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you - you shall never, never know.&nbsp; Yes,
I know you&rsquo;d been fined a hundred pounds if they&rsquo;d searched
me; but I never meant that they should.&nbsp; I daresay you wouldn&rsquo;t
smuggle - oh no! you don&rsquo;t think it worth your while.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
quite a conjuror, you are, Caudle.&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What am I laughing at</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you little know - such a clever creature!&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp;
Well, now, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; I knew what an unaccommodating
animal you were, so I made you smuggle whether or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when you were out at the <i>Caf&eacute;</i>, I got your
great rough coat, and if I didn&rsquo;t stitch ten yards of best black
velvet under the lining I&rsquo;m a sinful woman!&nbsp; And to see how
innocent you looked when the officers walked round and round you!&nbsp;
It was a happy moment, Caudle, to see you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A shameful trick - unworthy of a wife</i>?<i>&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
care much for you</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I didn&rsquo;t prove that by trusting you with ten yards
of velvet.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care what you say: I&rsquo;ve saved
everything - all but that beautiful English novel, that I&rsquo;ve forgot
the name of.&nbsp; And if they didn&rsquo;t take it out of my hand,
and chopped it to bits like so much dog&rsquo;s-meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Served me right</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I so seldom buy a book!&nbsp; No: I don&rsquo;t see
how it served me right.&nbsp; If you can buy the same book in France
for four shillings that people here have the impudence to ask more than
a guinea for - well, if they <i>do</i> steal it, that&rsquo;s their
affair, not ours.&nbsp; As if there was anything in a book to steal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Caudle, when are you going home?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our time isn&rsquo;t up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it.&nbsp; If we even lose
a week&rsquo;s lodging - and we mayn&rsquo;t do that - we shall save
it again in living.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re such a man!&nbsp; Your home&rsquo;s
the last place with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t get a wink
of a night, thinking what may happen.&nbsp; Three fires last week; and
any one might as well have been at our house as not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No - they mightn&rsquo;t</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean - but you&rsquo;re such a man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, too, we&rsquo;ve had quite enough of this
place.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no keeping you out of the libraries,
Caudle.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re getting quite a gambler.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s a nice example to set your children, raffling as you
do for French clocks, and I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
not the worst; you never win anything.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot.&nbsp; Yes;
a needle-case, that under my nose you gave to Miss Prettyman.&nbsp;
A nice thing for a married man to make presents: and to such a creature
as that, too!&nbsp; A needle-case!&nbsp; I wonder whenever she has a
needle in <i>her</i> hand!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I shall feel ill with anxiety if I stop here.&nbsp;
Nobody left in the house but that Mrs. Closepeg.&nbsp; And she is such
a stupid woman.&nbsp; It was only last night that I dreamt I saw our
cat quite a skeleton, and the canary stiff on its back at the bottom
of the cage.&nbsp; You know, Caudle, I&rsquo;m never happy when I&rsquo;m
away from home; and yet you will stay here.&nbsp; No, home&rsquo;s my
comfort!&nbsp; I never want to stir over the threshold, and you know
it.&nbsp; If thieves were to break in, what could that Mrs. Closepeg
do against &rsquo;em?&nbsp; And so, Caudle, you&rsquo;ll go home on
Saturday?&nbsp; Our dear - dear home!&nbsp; On Saturday, Caudle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What I answered</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I forget;
but I know that on the Saturday we were once again shipped on board
the</i> &lsquo;<i>Red Rover</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXVIII - MRS. CAUDLE HAS RETURNED HOME.&nbsp; THE HOUSE
(OF COURSE) &ldquo;NOT FIT TO BE SEEN.&rdquo;&nbsp; MR. CAUDLE, IN SELF-DEFENCE,
TAKES A BOOK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Caudle, it is something to get into one&rsquo;s
own bed again.&nbsp; I <i>shall</i> sleep to-night.&nbsp; What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re glad of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like your sneering; I know what you mean.&nbsp;
Of course; I never can think of making myself comfortable, but you wound
my feelings.&nbsp; If you cared for your own bed like any other man,
you&rsquo;d not have stayed out till this hour.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
that I drove you out of the house as soon as we came in it.&nbsp; I
only just spoke about the dirt and the dust, - but the fact is, you&rsquo;d
be happy in a pig-sty!&nbsp; I thought I could have trusted that Mrs.
Closepeg with untold gold; and did you only see the hearthrug?&nbsp;
When we left home there was a tiger in it: I should like to know who
could make out the tiger, now?&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s very well for you
to swear at the tiger, but swearing won&rsquo;t revive the rug again.&nbsp;
Else you might swear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could go out and make yourself comfortable at your club.&nbsp;
You little know how many windows are broken.&nbsp; How many do you think?&nbsp;
No: I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell you to-morrow - you shall know now.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure!&nbsp; Talking about getting health at Margate; all my
health went away directly I went into the kitchen.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
dear mother&rsquo;s china bowl cracked in two places.&nbsp; I could
have sat down and cried when I saw it: a bowl I can recollect when I
was a child.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I should have locked it up, then</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: that&rsquo;s your feeling for anything of mine.&nbsp;
I only wish it had been your punch-bowl; but, thank goodness!&nbsp;
I think that&rsquo;s chipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t answered about the windows - you can&rsquo;t
guess how many?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t care</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if nobody caught cold but you, it would be little matter.&nbsp;
Six windows clean out, and three cracked!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You can&rsquo;t help it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know where the money&rsquo;s to come from
to mend &rsquo;em!&nbsp; They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be mended, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll see how respectable the house will look.&nbsp;
But I know very well what you think.&nbsp; Yes; you&rsquo;re glad of
it.&nbsp; You think that this will keep me at home - but I&rsquo;ll
never stir out again.&nbsp; Then you can go to the sea-side by yourself;
then, perhaps, you can be happy with Miss Prettyman? - Now, Caudle,
if you knock the pillow with your fist in that way, I&rsquo;ll get up.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very odd that I can&rsquo;t mention that person&rsquo;s name
but you begin to fight the bolster, and do I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp;
There must be something in it, or you wouldn&rsquo;t kick about so.&nbsp;
A guilty conscience needs no - but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t coming to town for a week; and then, of a
sudden, she&rsquo;d had a letter.&nbsp; I dare say she had.&nbsp; And
then, as she said, it would be company for her to come with us.&nbsp;
No doubt.&nbsp; She thought I should be ill again, and down in the cabin,
but with all her art, she does not know the depth of me - quite.&nbsp;
Not but what I was ill; though, like a brute, you wouldn&rsquo;t see
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Good-night, love</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: you can be very tender, I dare say - like all of your
sex - to suit your own ends; but I can&rsquo;t go to sleep with my head
full of the house.&nbsp; The fender in the parlour will never come to
itself again.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t counted the knives yet, but I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind that half of &rsquo;em are lost.&nbsp; No: I don&rsquo;t
always think the worst; no, and I don&rsquo;t make myself unhappy before
the time; but of course that&rsquo;s my thanks for caring about your
property.&nbsp; If there aren&rsquo;t spiders in the curtains as big
as nutmegs, I&rsquo;m a wicked creature.&nbsp; Not a broom has the whole
place seen since I&rsquo;ve been away.&nbsp; But as soon as I get up,
won&rsquo;t I rummage the house out, that&rsquo;s all!&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t
the heart to look at my pickles; but for all I left the door locked,
I&rsquo;m sure the jars have been moved.&nbsp; Yes; you can swear at
pickles when you&rsquo;re in bed; but nobody makes more noise about
&rsquo;em when you want &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope they&rsquo;ve been to the wine-cellar: then you
may know what my feelings are.&nbsp; That poor cat, too - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You hate cats</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor thing! because she&rsquo;s my favourite - that&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; If that cat could only speak - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It isn&rsquo;t necessary</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr. Caudle: but if that
cat could only speak, she&rsquo;d tell me how she&rsquo;s been cheated.&nbsp;
Poor thing!&nbsp; I know where the money&rsquo;s gone to that I left
for her milk - I know.&nbsp; Why, what have you got there, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp;
A book?&nbsp; What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If you aren&rsquo;t allowed to sleep, you&rsquo;ll read</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now it is come to something!&nbsp; If that isn&rsquo;t
insulting a wife to bring a book to bed, I don&rsquo;t know what wedlock
is.&nbsp; But you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t read, Caudle; no, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t;
not while I&rsquo;ve strength to get up and put out a candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s like your feelings!&nbsp; You can think a
great deal of trumpery books; yes, you can&rsquo;t think too much of
the stuff that&rsquo;s put into print; but for what&rsquo;s real and
true about you, why, you&rsquo;ve the heart of a stone.&nbsp; I should
like to know what that book&rsquo;s about.&nbsp; What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Milton&rsquo;s</i> &lsquo;<i>Paradise Lost</i>&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought some rubbish of the sort - something to insult me.&nbsp;
A nice book, I think, to read in bed; and a very respectable person
he was who wrote it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I know of him</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more than you think.&nbsp; A very pretty fellow, indeed,
with his six wives.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He hadn&rsquo;t six - he&rsquo;d only three</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it; but of course you&rsquo;ll
take his part.&nbsp; Poor women!&nbsp; A nice time they had with him,
I dare say!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve no doubt, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;d like
to follow Mr. Milton&rsquo;s example; else you wouldn&rsquo;t read the
stuff he wrote.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t use me as he treated the poor
souls who married him.&nbsp; Poets, indeed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d make a law
against any of &rsquo;em having wives, except upon paper; for goodness
help the dear creatures tied to them!&nbsp; Like innocent moths lured
by a candle!&nbsp; Talking of candles, you don&rsquo;t know that the
lamp in the passage is split to bits!&nbsp; I say you don&rsquo;t -
do you hear me, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you answer?&nbsp; Do you
know where you are?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>In the Garden of Eden</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ve no business there at this
time of night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And saying this</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>she
scrambled from the bed and put out the night</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE XXIX - MRS. CAUDLE THINKS &ldquo;THE TIME HAS COME TO HAVE
A COTTAGE OUT OF TOWN&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caudle, you ought to have had something nice to-night;
for you&rsquo;re not well, love - I know you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; Ha!
that&rsquo;s like you men - so headstrong!&nbsp; You will have it that
nothing ails you; but I can tell, Caudle.&nbsp; The eye of a wife -
and such a wife as I&rsquo;ve been to you - can at once see whether
a husband&rsquo;s well or not.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been turning like
tallow all the week; and what&rsquo;s more, you eat nothing now.&nbsp;
It makes me melancholy to see you at a joint.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say
anything at dinner before the children; but I don&rsquo;t feel the less.&nbsp;
No, no; you&rsquo;re not very well; and you&rsquo;re not as strong as
a horse.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deceive yourself - nothing of the sort.&nbsp;
No, and you don&rsquo;t eat as much as ever: and if you do, you don&rsquo;t
eat with a relish, I&rsquo;m sure of that.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t deceive
me there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know what&rsquo;s killing you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
confinement; it&rsquo;s the bad air you breathe; it&rsquo;s the smoke
of London.&nbsp; Oh yes, I know your old excuse: you never found the
air bad before.&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; But as people grow older, and
get on in trade - and, after all, we&rsquo;ve nothing to complain of,
Caudle - London air always disagrees with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Delicate
health comes with money: I&rsquo;m sure of it.&nbsp; What a colour you
had once, when you&rsquo;d hardly a sixpence; and now, look at you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould add thirty years to your life - and think what
a blessing that would be to me; not that I shall live a tenth part of
the time - thirty years, if you&rsquo;d take a nice little house somewhere
at Brixton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You hate Brixton</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say it, Caudle, that&rsquo;s so like you: any place
that&rsquo;s really genteel you can&rsquo;t abide.&nbsp; Now Brixton
and Baalam Hill I think delightful.&nbsp; So select!&nbsp; There, nobody
visits nobody, unless they&rsquo;re somebody.&nbsp; To say nothing of
the delightful pews that make the churches so respectable!</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, do as you like.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t go to Brixton,
what do you say to Clapham Common?&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s a very fine
story!&nbsp; Never tell me!&nbsp; No; you wouldn&rsquo;t be left alone,
a Robinson Crusoe with wife and children, because you&rsquo;re in the
retail way.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The retired wholesales never visit the retired retails
at Clapham</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s only your old sneering at the world, Mr.
Caudle; but I don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; And after all, people should
keep to their station, or what was this life made for?&nbsp; Suppose
a tallow-merchant does keep himself above a tallow-chandler, - I call
it only a proper pride.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You call it the aristocracy of fat</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by &lsquo;aristocracy&rsquo;;
but I suppose it&rsquo;s only another of your dictionary words, that&rsquo;s
hardly worth the finding out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to Hornsey or Muswell Hill?&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Too high</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a man you are!&nbsp; Well, then - Battersea?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Too low</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an aggravating creature, Caudle, you must own
that!&nbsp; Hampstead, then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Too cold</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense; it would brace you up like a drum, - Caudle; and
that&rsquo;s what you want.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t deserve anybody
to think of your health or your comforts either.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
some pretty spots, I&rsquo;m told, about Fulham.&nbsp; Now, Caudle,
I won&rsquo;t have you say a word against Fulham.&nbsp; That must be
a sweet place: dry and healthy, and every comfort of life about it -
else is it likely that a bishop would live there?&nbsp; Now, Caudle,
none of your heathen principles - I won&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I think what satisfies a bishop ought to content you; but the politics
you learn at that club are dreadful.&nbsp; To hear you talk of bishops
- well, I only hope nothing will happen to you, for the sake of the
dear children!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice little house and a garden!&nbsp; I know it - I was
born for a garden!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something about it makes one
feel so innocent.&nbsp; My heart somehow always opens and shuts at roses.&nbsp;
And then what nice currant wine we could make!&nbsp; And again, get
&rsquo;em as fresh as you will, there&rsquo;s no radishes like your
own radishes!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re ten times as sweet!&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And twenty times as dear</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there you go!&nbsp; Anything that I fancy, you always
bring up the expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Caudle, I should not be tired of it in a month.&nbsp;
I tell you I was made for the country.&nbsp; But here you&rsquo;ve kept
me - and much you&rsquo;ve cared about my health - here you&rsquo;ve
kept me in this filthy London, that I hardly know what grass is made
of.&nbsp; Much you care for your wife and family to keep &rsquo;em here
to be all smoked like bacon.&nbsp; I can see it - it&rsquo;s stopping
the children&rsquo;s growth; they&rsquo;ll be dwarfs, and have their
father to thank for it.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d the heart of a parent,
you couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at their white faces.&nbsp; Dear little
Dick! he makes no breakfast.&nbsp; What!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He ate six slices this morning</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty father you must be to count &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s nothing to what the dear child could do, if, like other
children, he&rsquo;d a fair chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! and when we could be so comfortable!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
always the case, you never will be comfortable with me.&nbsp; How nice
and fresh you&rsquo;d come up to business every morning; and what pleasure
it would be for me to put a tulip or a pink in your button-hole, just,
as I may say, to ticket you from the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, Caudle, you never were like any other man!&nbsp;
But I know why you won&rsquo;t leave London.&nbsp; Yes, I know.&nbsp;
Then, you think, you couldn&rsquo;t go to your filthy club - that&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;d be obliged to be at home, like any other
decent man.&nbsp; Whereas you might, if you liked, enjoy yourself under
your own apple-tree, and I&rsquo;m sure I should never say anything
about your tobacco out of doors.&nbsp; My only wish is to make you happy,
Caudle, and you won&rsquo;t let me do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak, love?&nbsp; Shall I look about a house
to-morrow?&nbsp; It will be a broken day with me, for I&rsquo;m going
out to have little pet&rsquo;s ears bored - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t have her ears bored</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, I should like to know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a barbarous, savage custom</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Caudle! the sooner you go away from the world, and
live in a cave, the better.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re getting not fit for Christian
society.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; My ears were bored and - What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>So are yours</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean - but that&rsquo;s nothing to do with
it.&nbsp; My ears, I say, were bored, and so were dear mother&rsquo;s,
and grandmother&rsquo;s before her; and I suppose there were no more
savages in our family than in yours, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; Besides, - why
should little pet&rsquo;s ears go naked any more than any of her sisters&rsquo;?&nbsp;
They wear earrings; you never objected before.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve learned better now</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all with your filthy politics again.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d shake all the world up in a dice-box, if you&rsquo;d your
way: not that you care a pin about the world, only you&rsquo;d like
to get a better throw for yourself, - that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But little
pet <i>shall</i> be bored, and don&rsquo;t think to prevent it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s to be married some day, as well as her
sisters?&nbsp; And who&rsquo;ll look at a girl without earrings, I should
like to know?&nbsp; If you knew anything of the world, you&rsquo;d know
what a nice diamond earring will sometimes do - when one can get it
- before this.&nbsp; But I know why you can&rsquo;t abide earrings now:
Miss Prettyman doesn&rsquo;t wear &rsquo;em; she would - I&rsquo;ve
no doubt - if she could only get &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s Miss
Prettyman who -</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Caudle, now be quiet, and I&rsquo;ll say no more about
pet&rsquo;s ears at present.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll talk when you&rsquo;re
reasonable.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to put you out of temper, goodness
knows!&nbsp; And so, love, about the cottage?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<i>Twill be so far from business</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it needn&rsquo;t be far, dearest.&nbsp; Quite a nice distance;
so that on your late nights you may always be at home, have your supper,
get to bed, and all by eleven.&nbsp; Eh, - sweet one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t know what I answered</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle,
&ldquo;<i>but I know this: in less than a fortnight I found myself in
a sort of a green bird-cage of a house, which my wife - gentle satirist
- insisted upon calling</i> &lsquo;<i>The Turtle Dovery</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXX - MRS. CAUDLE COMPLAINS OF THE &ldquo;TURTLE DOVERY.&rdquo;&nbsp;
DISCOVERS BLACK-BEETLES.&nbsp; THINKS IT &ldquo;NOTHING BUT RIGHT&rdquo;
THAT CAUDLE SHOULD SET UP A CHAISE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tush!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d never have got me into this wilderness
of a place, Mr. Caudle, if I&rsquo;d only have thought what it was.&nbsp;
Yes, that&rsquo;s right: throw it in my teeth that it was my choice
- that&rsquo;s manly, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; When I saw the place the
sun was out, and it looked beautiful - now, it&rsquo;s quite another
thing.&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle; I don&rsquo;t expect you to command the
sun, - and if you talk about Joshua in that infidel way, I&rsquo;ll
leave the bed.&nbsp; No, sir; I don&rsquo;t expect the sun to be in
your power; but that&rsquo;s nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I talk about
one thing, and you always start another.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s your
art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure a woman might as well be buried alive as live
here.&nbsp; In fact, I am buried alive; I feel it.&nbsp; I stood at
the window three hours this blessed day, and saw nothing but the postman.&nbsp;
No: it isn&rsquo;t a pity that I hadn&rsquo;t something better to do;
I had plenty: but that&rsquo;s my business, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; I suppose
I&rsquo;m to be mistress of my own house?&nbsp; If not, I&rsquo;d better
leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the very first night we were here, you know it, the black-beetles
came into the kitchen.&nbsp; If the place didn&rsquo;t seem spread all
over with a black cloth, I&rsquo;m a story-teller.&nbsp; What are you
coughing at, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; I see nothing to cough at.&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s just your way of sneering.&nbsp; Millions of black-beetles!&nbsp;
And as the clock strikes eight, out they march.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They&rsquo;re very punctual</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that.&nbsp; I only wish other people were half as punctual:
&rsquo;twould save other people&rsquo;s money and other people&rsquo;s
peace of mind.&nbsp; You know I hate a black-beetle!&nbsp; No: I don&rsquo;t
hate so many things.&nbsp; But I do hate black-beetles, as I hate ill-treatment,
Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; And now I have enough of both, goodness knows!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night they came into the parlour.&nbsp; Of course, in
a night or two, they&rsquo;ll walk up into the bedroom.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
be here - regiments of &rsquo;em - on the quilt.&nbsp; But what do you
care?&nbsp; Nothing of the sort ever touches you: but you know how they
come to me; and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so quiet.&nbsp; A pleasant
thing to have black-beetles in one&rsquo;s bed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why don&rsquo;t I poison &rsquo;em</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty matter, indeed, to have poison in the house!&nbsp;
Much you must think of the dear children.&nbsp; A nice place, too, to
be called the Turtle Dovery!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Didn&rsquo;t I christen it myself</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, - but then, I knew nothing of the black-beetles.&nbsp;
Besides, names of houses are for the world outside; not that anybody
passes to see ours.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Digby insist on calling
their new house &lsquo;Love-in-Idleness,&rsquo; though everybody knew
that that wretch Digby was always beating her?&nbsp; Still, when folks
read &lsquo;Rose Cottage&rsquo; on the wall, they seldom think of the
lots of thorns that are inside.&nbsp; In this world, Mr. Caudle, names
are sometimes quite as good as things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cough again!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got a cold, and you&rsquo;ll
always be getting one - for you&rsquo;ll always be missing the omnibus
as you did on Tuesday, - and always be getting wet.&nbsp; No constitution
can stand it, Caudle.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what I felt when I
heard it rain on Tuesday, and thought you might be in it.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m very good</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I trust so: I try to be so, Caudle.&nbsp; And so, dear,
I&rsquo;ve been thinking that we&rsquo;d better keep a chaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You can&rsquo;t afford it, and you won&rsquo;t</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me: I know you&rsquo;d save money by it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been reckoning what you lay out in omnibuses; and if you&rsquo;d
a chaise of your own - besides the gentility of the thing - you&rsquo;d
be money in pocket.&nbsp; And then, again, how often I could go with
you to town, - and how, again, I could call for you when you liked to
be a little late at the club, dear!&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;re obliged to
be hurried away, I know it, when, if you&rsquo;d only a carriage of
your own, you could stay and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; And after your work
you want enjoyment.&nbsp; Of course, I can&rsquo;t expect you always
to run home directly to me: and I don&rsquo;t, Caudle; and you know
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice, neat, elegant little chaise.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll think of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a love!&nbsp; You are a good creature, Caudle;
and &rsquo;twill make me so happy to think you don&rsquo;t depend upon
an omnibus.&nbsp; A sweet little carriage, with our own arms beautifully
painted on the panels.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Arms are rubbish; and you don&rsquo;t know that you have
any</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense: to be sure you have - and if not, of course they&rsquo;re
to be had for money.&nbsp; I wonder where Chalkpit&rsquo;s, the milkman&rsquo;s
arms, came from?&nbsp; I suppose you can buy &rsquo;em at the same place.&nbsp;
He used to drive a green cart; and now he&rsquo;s got a close yellow
carriage, with two large tortoise-shell cats, with their whiskers as
if dipped in cream, standing on their hind legs upon each door, with
a heap of Latin underneath.&nbsp; You may buy the carriage if you please,
Mr. Caudle; but unless your arms are there, you won&rsquo;t get me to
enter it.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to look less than Mrs.
Chalkpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, if you haven&rsquo;t arms, I&rsquo;m sure my family
have, and a wife&rsquo;s arms are quite as good as a husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll write to-morrow to dear mother, to know what we took for
our family arms.&nbsp; What do you say?&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A mangle in a stone kitchen proper</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;re always insulting my family - always:
but you shall not put me out of temper to-night.&nbsp; Still, if you
don&rsquo;t like our arms, find your own.&nbsp; I daresay you could
have found &rsquo;em fast enough, if you&rsquo;d married Miss Prettyman.&nbsp;
Well, I will be quiet; and I won&rsquo;t mention that lady&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;
A nice lady she is!&nbsp; I wonder how much she spends in paint!&nbsp;
Now, don&rsquo;t I tell you I won&rsquo;t say a word more, and yet you
will kick about!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have the carriage and the family arms?&nbsp;
No, I don&rsquo;t want the family legs too.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be vulgar,
Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; You might, perhaps, talk in that way before you&rsquo;d
money in the Bank; but it doesn&rsquo;t at all become you now.&nbsp;
The carriage and the family arms!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve a country house
as well as the Chalkpits! and though they praise their place for a little
paradise, I dare say they&rsquo;ve quite as many blackbeetles as we
have, and more too.&nbsp; The place quite looks it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our carriage and our arms!&nbsp; And you know, love, it won&rsquo;t
cost much - next to nothing - to put a gold band about Sam&rsquo;s hat
on a Sunday.&nbsp; No: I don&rsquo;t want a full-blown livery.&nbsp;
At least, not just yet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m told that Chalkpits dress their
boy on a Sunday like a dragon-fly; and I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t
do what we like with our own Sam.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll be
content with a gold band, and a bit of pepper-and-salt.&nbsp; No: I
shall not cry out for plush next; certainly not.&nbsp; But I will have
a gold band, and -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t; and I know it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! that&rsquo;s another of your crotchets, Mr Caudle;
like nobody else - you don&rsquo;t love liveries.&nbsp; I suppose when
people buy their sheets, or their tablecloths, or any other linen, they&rsquo;ve
a right to mark what they like upon it, haven&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Well,
then?&nbsp; You buy a servant, and you mark what you like upon him,
and where&rsquo;s the difference?&nbsp; None, that <i>I</i> can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Finally</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>I compromised
for a gig; but Sam did not wear pepper-and-salt and a gold band</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXXI - MRS. CAUDLE COMPLAINS VERY BITTERLY THAT MR. CAUDLE
HAS &ldquo;BROKEN HER CONFIDENCE.&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;O you&rsquo;ll catch me, Mr. Caudle, telling you anything
again.&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t want to have any noise: I don&rsquo;t
wish you to put yourself in a passion.&nbsp; All I say is this; never
again do I open my lips to you about anybody.&nbsp; No: if man and wife
can&rsquo;t be one, why there&rsquo;s an end of everything.&nbsp; Oh,
you know well what I mean, Mr. Caudle: you&rsquo;ve broken my confidence
in the most shameful, the most heartless way, and I repeat it - I can
never be again to you as I have been.&nbsp; No: the little charm - it
wasn&rsquo;t much - that remained about married life, is gone for ever.&nbsp;
Yes; the bloom&rsquo;s quite wiped off the plum now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a hypocrite, Caudle; don&rsquo;t ask me
what I mean!&nbsp; Mrs. Badgerly has been here - more like a fiend,
I&rsquo;m sure, than a quiet woman.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t done trembling
yet!&nbsp; You know the state of my nerves, too; you know - yes, sir,
I <i>had</i> nerves when you married me; and I haven&rsquo;t just found
&rsquo;em out.&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;ve something to answer for, I think.&nbsp;
The Badgerlys are going to separate: she takes the girls, and he the
boys, and all through you.&nbsp; How you can lay your head upon that
pillow and think of going to sleep, I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What have you done</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have a face to ask the question.&nbsp; Done?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve broken my confidence, Mr. Caudle: you&rsquo;ve taken advantage
of my tenderness, my trust in you as a wife - the more fool I for my
pains! - and you&rsquo;ve separated a happy couple for ever.&nbsp; No;
I&rsquo;m not talking in the clouds; I&rsquo;m talking in your bed,
the more my misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caudle - yes, I shall sit up in the bed if I choose;
I&rsquo;m not going to sleep till I have this properly explained; for
Mrs. Badgerly sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t lay her separation at my door.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t deny that you were at the club last night?&nbsp; No,
bad as you are, Caudle - and though you&rsquo;re my husband, I can&rsquo;t
think you a good man; I try to do, but I can&rsquo;t - bad as you are,
you can&rsquo;t deny you were at the club.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t deny it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say - you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And now answer
me this question.&nbsp; What did you say - before the whole world -
of Mr. Badgerly&rsquo;s whiskers?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to laugh
at, Caudle; if you&rsquo;d have seen that poor woman to-day, you&rsquo;d
have a heart of stone to laugh.&nbsp; What did you say of his whiskers?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you tell everybody he dyed &rsquo;em?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
you hold the candle up to &rsquo;em, as you said, to show the purple?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To be sure you did</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! people who break jokes never care about breaking hearts.&nbsp;
Badgerly went home like a demon; called his wife a false woman: vowed
he&rsquo;d never enter a bed again with her, and to show he was in earnest,
slept all night upon the sofa.&nbsp; He said it was the dearest secret
of his life; said she had told me; and that I had told you; and that&rsquo;s
how it has come out.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Badgerly was right.&nbsp; I did tell you</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did: but when dear Mrs. Badgerly mentioned the matter
to me and a few friends, as we were all laughing at tea together, quite
in a confidential way - when she just spoke of her husband&rsquo;s whiskers,
and how long he was over &rsquo;em every morning - of course, poor soul!
she never thought it was to be talked of in the world again.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Then I had no right to tell you of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m thanked for my confidence.&nbsp;
Because I don&rsquo;t keep a secret from you, but show you, I may say,
my naked soul, Caudle, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m rewarded.&nbsp; Poor
Mrs. Badgerly - for all her hard words - after she went away, I&rsquo;m
sure my heart quite bled for her.&nbsp; What do you say, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Serves her right - she should hold her tongue</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s like your tyranny - you&rsquo;d never let
a poor woman speak.&nbsp; Eh - what, what, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very fine speech, I dare say; and wives are
very much obliged to you, only there&rsquo;s not a bit of truth in it.&nbsp;
No, we women don&rsquo;t get together, and pick our husbands to pieces,
just as sometimes mischievous little girls rip up their dolls.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s an old sentiment of yours, Mr. Caudle; but I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ve no occasion to say it of me.&nbsp; I hear a good deal of
other people&rsquo;s husbands, certainly; I can&rsquo;t shut my ears;
I wish I could: but I never say anything about you, - and I might, and
you know it - and there&rsquo;s somebody else that knows it, too.&nbsp;
No: I sit still and say nothing; what I have in my own bosom about you,
Caudle, will be buried with me.&nbsp; But I know what you think of wives.&nbsp;
I heard you talking to Mr. Prettyman, when you little thought I was
listening, and you didn&rsquo;t know much what you were saying - I heard
you.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear Prettyman,&rsquo; says you, &lsquo;when some
women get talking, they club all their husbands&rsquo; faults together;
just as children club their cakes and apples, to make a common feast
for the whole set.&rsquo;&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t remember it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do: and I remember, too, what brandy was left when Prettyman
left.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be odd if you could remember much about it,
after that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve gone and separated man and wife, and
I&rsquo;m to be blamed for it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve not only carried misery
into a family, but broken my confidence.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve proved to
me that henceforth I&rsquo;m not to trust you with anything, Mr. Caudle.&nbsp;
No; I&rsquo;ll lock up whatever I know in my own breast, - for now I
find nobody, not even one&rsquo;s own husband, is to be relied upon.&nbsp;
From this moment, I may look upon myself as a solitary woman.&nbsp;
Now, it&rsquo;s no use your trying to go to sleep.&nbsp; What do you
say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You know that</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Now I want to ask you one question more.&nbsp;
Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You want to ask me one</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well - go on - I&rsquo;m not afraid to be catechised.&nbsp;
I never dropped a syllable that as a wife I ought to have kept to myself
- no, I&rsquo;m not at all forgetting what I&rsquo;ve said - and whatever
you&rsquo;ve got to ask me speak out at once.&nbsp; No - I don&rsquo;t
want you to spare me; all I want you is to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You will speak</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who told people you&rsquo;d a false front tooth</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that all?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure - as if the world
couldn&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; I know I did just mention it once, but
then I thought everybody knew it - besides, I was aggravated to do it;
yes, aggravated.&nbsp; I remember it was that very day, at Mrs. Badgerly&rsquo;s,
when husbands&rsquo; whiskers came up.&nbsp; Well, after we&rsquo;d
done with them, somebody said something about teeth.&nbsp; Whereupon,
Miss Prettyman - a minx! she was born to destroy the peace of families,
I know she was: she was there; and if I&rsquo;d only known that such
a creature was - no I&rsquo;m not rambling, not at all, and I&rsquo;m
coming to the tooth.&nbsp; To be sure, this is a great deal you&rsquo;ve
got against me, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Well, somebody spoke about teeth,
when Miss Prettyman, with one of her insulting leers, said &lsquo;she
thought Mr. Caudle had the whitest teeth she ever <i>had</i> beheld.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of course my blood was up - every wife&rsquo;s would be: and I believe
I might have said, &lsquo;Yes, they were well enough; but when a young
lady so very much praised a married man&rsquo;s teeth, she perhaps didn&rsquo;t
know that one of the front ones was an elephant&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Like her impudence! - I set <i>her</i> down for the rest of the evening.&nbsp;
But I can see the humour you&rsquo;re in to-night.&nbsp; You only came
to bed to quarrel, and I&rsquo;m not going to indulge you.&nbsp; All
I say is this, after the shameful mischief you&rsquo;ve made at the
Badgerlys&rsquo;, you never break my confidence again.&nbsp; Never -
and now you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Caudle hereupon writes - &ldquo;<i>And here she seemed inclined to
sleep.&nbsp; Not for one moment did I think to prevent her</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXXII - MRS. CAUDLE DISCOURSES OF MAIDS-OF-ALL-WORK AND
MAIDS IN GENERAL.&nbsp; MR. CAUDLE&rsquo;S &ldquo;INFAMOUS BEHAVIOUR&rdquo;
TEN YEARS AGO</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There now, it isn&rsquo;t my intention to say a word to-night,
Mr. Caudle.&nbsp; No; I want to go to sleep, if I can; for after what
I&rsquo;ve gone through to-day, and with the headache I&rsquo;ve got,
- and if I haven&rsquo;t left my smelling-salts on the mantelpiece,
on the right-hand corner just as you go into the room - nobody could
miss it - I say, nobody could miss it - in a little green bottle, and
- well, there you lie like a stone, and I might perish and you wouldn&rsquo;t
move.&nbsp; Oh, my poor head!&nbsp; But it may open and shut, and what
do you care?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s like your feeling, just.&nbsp; I want my
salts, and you tell me there&rsquo;s nothing like being still for a
headache.&nbsp; Indeed?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not going to be still; so
don&rsquo;t you think it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just how a woman&rsquo;s
put upon.&nbsp; But I know your aggravation - I know your art.&nbsp;
You think to keep me quiet about that minx Kitty, - your favourite,
sir!&nbsp; Upon my life, I&rsquo;m not to discharge my own servant without
- but she shall go.&nbsp; If I had to do all the work myself, she shouldn&rsquo;t
stop under my roof.&nbsp; I can see how she looks down upon me.&nbsp;
I can see a great deal, Mr. Caudle, that I never choose to open my lips
about - but I can&rsquo;t shut my eyes.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have
been better for my peace and mind if I always could.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
say that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a foolish woman, and I know very well
what I&rsquo;m saying.&nbsp; I suppose you think I forget <i>that</i>
Rebecca?&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s ten years ago that she lived with us
- but what&rsquo;s that to do with it?&nbsp; Things aren&rsquo;t the
less true for being old, I suppose.&nbsp; No; and your conduct, Mr.
Caudle, at that time - if it was a hundred years ago - I should never
forget.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shall always be the same silly woman</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall - I trust I shall always have my eyes about
me in my own house.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t think of going to sleep,
Caudle; because, as you&rsquo;ve brought this up about that Rebecca,
you shall hear me out.&nbsp; Well, I do wonder that you can name her!&nbsp;
Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You didn&rsquo;t name her</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all to do with it; for I know just
as well what you think, as if you did.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ll
say that you didn&rsquo;t drink a glass of wine to her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you said at the time, but I&rsquo;ve thought of it for
ten long years, and the more I&rsquo;ve thought the surer I am of it.&nbsp;
And at that very time - if you please to recollect - at that very time
little Jack was a baby.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have so much cared but
for that; but he was hardly running alone, when you nodded and drank
a glass of wine to that creature.&nbsp; No; I&rsquo;m not mad, and I&rsquo;m
not dreaming.&nbsp; I saw how you did it, - and the hypocrisy made it
worse and worse.&nbsp; I saw you when the creature was just behind my
chair; you took up a glass of wine, and saying to me, &lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo;
and then lifting up your eyes at the bold minx, and saying &lsquo;my
dear,&rsquo; as if you wanted me to believe that you spoke only to me,
when I could see you laugh at her behind me.&nbsp; And at that time
little Jack wasn&rsquo;t on his feet.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Heaven forgive me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle, it&rsquo;s you that ought to ask for
that: I&rsquo;m safe enough, I am: it&rsquo;s you who should ask to
be forgiven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t slander a saint - and I didn&rsquo;t
take away the girl&rsquo;s character for nothing.&nbsp; I know she brought
an action for what I said; and I know you had to pay damages for what
you call my tongue - I well remember all that.&nbsp; And serve you right;
if you hadn&rsquo;t laughed at her, it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.&nbsp;
But if you will make free with such people, of course you&rsquo;re sure
to suffer for it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould have served you right if the lawyer&rsquo;s
bill had been double.&nbsp; Damages, indeed!&nbsp; Not that anybody&rsquo;s
tongue could have damaged her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Caudle, you&rsquo;re the same man you were ten
years ago.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You hope so</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more shame for you.&nbsp; At your time of life, with all
your children growing up about you, to -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What am I talking of</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very well; and so would you, if you had any conscience,
which you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; When I say I shall discharge Kitty, you
say she&rsquo;s a very good servant, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get a
better.&nbsp; But I know why you think her good; you think her pretty,
and that&rsquo;s enough for you; as if girls who work for their bread
have any business to be pretty, - which she isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Pretty
servants, indeed! going mincing about with their fal-lal faces, as if
even the flies would spoil &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I know what a bad man
you are - now, it&rsquo;s no use your denying it; for didn&rsquo;t I
overhear you talking to Mr. Prettyman, and didn&rsquo;t you say that
you couldn&rsquo;t bear to have ugly servants about you?&nbsp; I ask
you, - didn&rsquo;t you say that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Perhaps you did</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t blush to confess it?&nbsp; If your principles,
Mr. Caudle, aren&rsquo;t enough to make a woman&rsquo;s blood run cold!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! you&rsquo;ve talked that stuff again and again; and
once I might have believed it; but I know a little more of you now.&nbsp;
You like to see pretty servants, just as you like to see pretty statues,
and pretty pictures, and pretty flowers, and anything in nature that&rsquo;s
pretty, just, as you say, for the eye to feed upon.&nbsp; Yes; I know
your eyes, - very well.&nbsp; I know what they were ten years ago; for
shall I ever forget that glass of wine when little Jack was in arms?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t care if it was a thousand years ago, it&rsquo;s as fresh
as yesterday, and I never will cease to talk of it.&nbsp; When you know
me, how can you ask it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you insist upon keeping Kitty, when there&rsquo;s
no having a bit of crockery for her?&nbsp; That girl would break the
Bank of England - I know she would - if she was to put her hand upon
it.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s a whole set of blue china to her beautiful
blue eyes?&nbsp; I know that&rsquo;s what you mean, though you don&rsquo;t
say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t lie groaning there, for you don&rsquo;t
think I shall ever forget Rebecca.&nbsp; Yes, - it&rsquo;s very well
for you to swear at Rebecca now, - but you didn&rsquo;t swear at her
then, Mr. Caudle, I know.&nbsp; &lsquo;Margaret, my dear!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, how you can have the face to look at me -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t look at me</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more shame for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say, that either Kitty leaves the house, or I do.&nbsp;
Which is it to be, Mr. Caudle?&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t care</i>?<i>&nbsp; Both</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to get rid of me in that manner,
I can tell you.&nbsp; But for that trollop - now, you may swear and
rave as you like -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t intend to say a word more</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; it&rsquo;s no matter what you say - her quarter&rsquo;s
up on Tuesday, and go she shall.&nbsp; A soup-plate and a basin went
yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soup-plate and a basin, and when I&rsquo;ve the headache
as I have, Mr. Caudle, tearing me to pieces!&nbsp; But I shall never
be well in this world - never.&nbsp; A soup-plate and a basin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She slept</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle, &ldquo;<i>and poor
Kitty left on Tuesday</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE XXXIII - MRS. CAUDLE HAS DISCOVERED THAT CAUDLE IS A RAILWAY
DIRECTOR</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;When I took up the paper to-day, Caudle, you might have knocked
me down with a feather!&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite - you
know what&rsquo;s the matter.&nbsp; And when you haven&rsquo;t a bed
to lie upon, and are brought to sleep upon coal sacks - and then I can
tell you, Mr. Caudle, you may sleep by yourself - then you&rsquo;ll
know what&rsquo;s the matter.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ve seen your name,
and don&rsquo;t deny it.&nbsp; Yes, - the Eel-Pie Island Railway - and
among the Directors, Job Caudle, Esq., of the Turtle-Dovery, and - no,
I won&rsquo;t be quiet.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often - goodness knows!
- that I speak; but seeing what I do, I won&rsquo;t be silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do I see</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there, Mr. Caudle, at the foot of the bed, I see all
the blessed children in tatters - I see you in a gaol, and the carpets
hung out of the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I know why you talk in your sleep about a broad and
narrow gauge!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t think what was on your mind - but
now it&rsquo;s out.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle, there&rsquo;s something
about a broad and narrow way that I wish you&rsquo;d remember - but
you&rsquo;re turned quite a heathen: yes, you think of nothing but money
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t I like money</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do; but then I like it when I&rsquo;m certain
of it; no risks for me.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well to talk
about fortunes made in no time: they&rsquo;re like shirts made in no
time - it&rsquo;s ten to one if they hang long together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s plain enough why you can&rsquo;t eat or
drink, or sleep, or do anything.&nbsp; All your mind&rsquo;s allotted
into railways; for you shan&rsquo;t make me believe that Eel-Pie Island&rsquo;s
the only one.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; I can see by the looks of you.&nbsp;
Why, in a little time, if you haven&rsquo;t as many lines in your face
as there are lines laid down!&nbsp; Every one of your features seems
cut up - and all seem travelling from one another.&nbsp; Six months
ago, Caudle, you hadn&rsquo;t a wrinkle; yes, you&rsquo;d a cheek as
smooth as any china, and now your face is like the Map of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your time of life, too!&nbsp; You, who were for always
going small and sure!&nbsp; You to make heads-and-tails of your money
in this way!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that stock-broker&rsquo;s dog at Flam
Cottage - he&rsquo;s bitten you, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
not fit to manage your own property now; and I should only be acting
the part of a good wife if I were to call in the mad-doctors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall never know rest any more now.&nbsp; There won&rsquo;t
be a soul knock at the door after this that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s the man coming to take possession.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be
something for the Chalkpits to laugh at when we&rsquo;re sold up.&nbsp;
I think I see &rsquo;em here, bidding for all our little articles of
bigotry and virtue, and - what are you laughing at?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They&rsquo;re not bigotry and virtue; but bijouterie and
vertu</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same: only you&rsquo;re never so happy
as when you&rsquo;re taking me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can tell what&rsquo;s coming to the world, I&rsquo;m
a sinner!&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s for turning their farthings into double
sovereigns and cheating their neighbours of the balance.&nbsp; And you,
too - you&rsquo;re beside yourself, Caudle - I&rsquo;m sure of it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve watched you when you thought me fast asleep.&nbsp; And then
you&rsquo;ve lain, and whispered and whispered, and then hugged yourself,
and laughed at the bed-posts, as if you&rsquo;d seen &rsquo;em turned
to sovereign gold.&nbsp; I do believe that you sometimes think the patchwork
quilt is made of thousand-pound bank-notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when we&rsquo;re brought to the Union, then you&rsquo;ll
find out your mistake.&nbsp; But it will be a poor satisfaction for
me every night to tell you of it.&nbsp; What, Mr. Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They won&rsquo;t let me tell you of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you call that &lsquo;some comfort&rsquo;?&nbsp; And after
the wife I&rsquo;ve been to you!&nbsp; But now I recollect.&nbsp; I
think I&rsquo;ve heard you praise that Union before; though, like a
fond fool as I&rsquo;ve always been, I never once suspected the reason
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, of course, day and night, you&rsquo;ll never be at
home.&nbsp; No, you&rsquo;ll live and sleep at Eel-Pie Island!&nbsp;
I shall be left alone with nothing but my thoughts, thinking when the
broker will come, and you&rsquo;ll be with your brother directors.&nbsp;
I may slave and I toil to save sixpences; and you&rsquo;ll be throwing
away hundreds.&nbsp; And then the expensive tastes you&rsquo;ve got!&nbsp;
Nothing good enough for you now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you sometimes
think yourself King Solomon.&nbsp; But that comes of making money -
if, indeed, you have made any - without earning it.&nbsp; No; I don&rsquo;t
talk nonsense: people <i>can</i> make money without earning it.&nbsp;
And when they do, why it&rsquo;s like taking a lot of spirits at one
draught; it gets into their head, and they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re
about.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re in that state now, Mr. Caudle: I&rsquo;m
sure of it, by the way of you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a tipsiness of the
pocket as well as of the stomach - and you&rsquo;re in that condition
at this very moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I should so much mind - that is, if you <i>have</i>
made money - if you&rsquo;d stop at the Eel-Pie line.&nbsp; But I know
what these things are: they&rsquo;re like treacle to flies: when men
are well in &rsquo;em, they can&rsquo;t get out of &rsquo;em: or, if
they do, it&rsquo;s often without a feather to fly with.&nbsp; No: if
you&rsquo;ve really made money by the Eel-Pie line, and will give it
to me to take care of for the dear children, why, perhaps, love, I&rsquo;ll
say no more of the matter.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nonsense</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course: I never ask you for money, but that&rsquo;s
the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, catch you stopping at the Eel-Pie line!&nbsp; Oh
no; I know your aggravating spirit.&nbsp; In a day or two I shall see
another fine flourish in the paper, with a proposal for a branch from
Eel-Pie Island to the Chelsea Bun-house.&nbsp; Give you a mile of rail,
and - I know you men - you&rsquo;ll take a hundred.&nbsp; Well, if it
didn&rsquo;t make me quiver to read that stuff in the paper, - and your
name to it!&nbsp; But I suppose it was Mr. Prettyman&rsquo;s work; for
his precious name&rsquo;s among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; How you tell the people
&lsquo;that eel-pies are now become an essential element of civilisation&rsquo;
- I learnt all the words by heart, that I might say &rsquo;em to you
- &lsquo;that the Eastern population of London are cut off from the
blessings of such a necessary - and that by means of the projected line
eel-pies will be brought home to the business and bosoms of Ratcliff
Highway and the adjacent dependencies.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, when you men
- lords of the creation, as you call yourselves - do get together to
make up a company, or anything of the sort - is there any story-book
can come up to you?&nbsp; And so you look solemnly in one another&rsquo;s
faces, and, never so much as moving the corners of your mouths, pick
one another&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m not using hard words,
Mr. Caudle - but only the words that&rsquo;s proper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this I <i>must</i> say.&nbsp; Whatever you&rsquo;ve got,
I&rsquo;m none the better for it.&nbsp; You never give me any of your
Eel-Pie shares.&nbsp; What do you say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You will give me some</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I - I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with any wickedness
of the kind.&nbsp; If, like any other husband, you choose to throw a
heap of money into my lap - what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll think of it</i>?<i>&nbsp; When the Eel-Pies
go up</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know what they&rsquo;re worth - they&rsquo;ll never
fetch a farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She was suddenly silent</i>&rdquo; - writes Caudle - &ldquo;<i>and
I was sinking into sleep, when she elbowed me, and cried</i>, &lsquo;<i>Caudle,
do you think they&rsquo;ll be up to-morrow</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LECTURE XXXIV - MRS. CAUDLE, SUSPECTING THAT MR. CAUDLE HAS MADE
HIS WILL, IS &ldquo;ONLY ANXIOUS, AS A WIFE,&rdquo; TO KNOW ITS PROVISIONS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There, I always said you&rsquo;d a strong mind when you liked,
Caudle; and what you&rsquo;ve just been doing proves it.&nbsp; Some
people won&rsquo;t make a will, because they think they must die directly
afterwards.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;re above that, love, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
Nonsense; you know very well what I mean.&nbsp; I know your will&rsquo;s
made, for Scratcherly told me so.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t believe it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a pretty thing for
a man to say to his wife.&nbsp; I know he&rsquo;s too much of a man
of business to talk; but I suppose there&rsquo;s a way of telling things
without speaking them.&nbsp; And when I put the question to him, lawyer
as he is, he hadn&rsquo;t the face to deny it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, it can be of no consequence to me whether your
will is made or not.&nbsp; I shall not be alive, Mr. Caudle, to want
anything: I shall be provided for a long time before your will&rsquo;s
of any use.&nbsp; No, Mr. Caudle, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t survive you:
and - though a woman&rsquo;s wrong to let her affection for a man be
known, for then she&rsquo;s always taken advantage of - though I know
it&rsquo;s foolish and weak to say so, still I don&rsquo;t want to survive
you.&nbsp; How should I?&nbsp; No, no; don&rsquo;t say that: I&rsquo;m
not good for a hundred - I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see you out, and another
husband too.&nbsp; What a gross idea, Caudle!&nbsp; To imagine I&rsquo;d
ever think of marrying again.&nbsp; No - never!&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s what we all say</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; quite the reverse.&nbsp; To me the very idea of
such a thing is horrible, and always was.&nbsp; Yes, I know very well
that some do marry again - but what they&rsquo;re made of I&rsquo;m
sure I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; Ugh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men, I know, who leave their property in such a
way that their widows, to hold it, must keep widows.&nbsp; Now, if there
is anything in the world that is mean and small, it is that.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you think so, too, Caudle?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you speak, love?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s so like you!&nbsp; I never want a little quiet, rational
talk, but you want to go to sleep.&nbsp; But you never were like any
other man!&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How do I know</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now - that&rsquo;s so like your aggravating way.&nbsp;
I never open my lips upon a subject but you try to put me off.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no doubt when Miss Prettyman speaks, you can answer <i>her</i>
properly enough.&nbsp; There you are, again!&nbsp; Upon my life, it
<i>is</i> odd; but I never can in the most innocent way mention that
person&rsquo;s name that -</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why can&rsquo;t I leave her alone</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure - with all my heart!&nbsp; Who wants to talk
about her?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t: only you always will say something that&rsquo;s
certain to bring up her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I saying, Caudle?&nbsp; Oh, about the way some men
bind their widows.&nbsp; To my mind, there is nothing so little.&nbsp;
When a man forbids his wife to marry again without losing what he leaves
- it&rsquo;s what I call selfishness after death.&nbsp; Mean to a degree!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like taking his wife into the grave with him.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never want to do that</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure of that, love: you&rsquo;re not the man
to tie a woman up in that mean manner.&nbsp; A man who&rsquo;d do that
would have his widow burnt with him, if he could - just as those monsters,
that call themselves men, do in the Indies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s no matter to me how you&rsquo;ve made
your will; but it may be to your second wife.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shall never give you a chance</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you don&rsquo;t know my constitution after all, Caudle.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not at all the woman I was.&nbsp; I say nothing about &rsquo;em,
but very often you don&rsquo;t know my feelings.&nbsp; And as we&rsquo;re
on the subject, dearest, I have only one favour to ask.&nbsp; When you
marry again - now it&rsquo;s no use your saying that.&nbsp; After the
comforts you&rsquo;ve known of marriage - what are you sighing at, dear?
- after the comforts, you must marry again - now don&rsquo;t forswear
yourself in that violent way, taking an oath that you know you must
break - you couldn&rsquo;t help it, I&rsquo;m sure of it; and I know
you better than you know yourself.&nbsp; Well, all I ask is, love, because
it&rsquo;s only for your sake, and it would make no difference to me
then - how should it? - but all I ask is, don&rsquo;t marry Miss Pret
- There! there!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done: I won&rsquo;t say another word
about it; but all I ask is, don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; After the way you&rsquo;ve
been thought of, and after the comforts you&rsquo;ve been used to, Caudle,
she wouldn&rsquo;t be the wife for you.&nbsp; Of course I could then
have no interest in the matter - you might marry the Queen of England,
for what it would be to me then - I&rsquo;m only anxious about you.&nbsp;
Mind, Caudle, I&rsquo;m not saying anything against her; not at all;
but there&rsquo;s a flightiness in her manner - I dare say, poor thing,
she means no harm, and it may be, as the saying is, only her manner
after all - still, there is a flightiness about her that, after what
you&rsquo;ve been used to, would make you very wretched.&nbsp; Now,
if I may boast of anything, Caudle, it is my propriety of manner the
whole of my life.&nbsp; I know that wives who&rsquo;re very particular
aren&rsquo;t thought as well of as those who&rsquo;re not - still, it&rsquo;s
next to nothing to be virtuous, if people don&rsquo;t seem so.&nbsp;
And virtue, Caudle - no, I&rsquo;m not going to preach about virtue,
for I never do.&nbsp; No; and I don&rsquo;t go about with my virtue,
like a child with a drum, making all sorts of noises with it.&nbsp;
But I know your principles.&nbsp; I shall never forget what I once heard
you say to Prettyman: and it&rsquo;s no excuse that you&rsquo;d taken
so much wine you didn&rsquo;t know what you were saying at the time;
for wine brings out man&rsquo;s wickedness, just as fire brings out
spots of grease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What did you say</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you said this: - &lsquo;Virtue&rsquo;s a beautiful thing
in women, when they don&rsquo;t make so much noise about it: but there&rsquo;s
some women who think virtue was given &rsquo;em, as claws were given
to cats&rsquo; - yes, cats was the word - &lsquo;to do nothing but scratch
with.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t recollect a syllable of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s it; when you&rsquo;re in that dreadful state,
you recollect nothing: but it&rsquo;s a good thing I do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk of that, love - that&rsquo;s all over:
I dare say you meant nothing.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m glad you agree with
me, that the man who&rsquo;d tie up his widow not to marry again, is
a mean man.&nbsp; It makes me happy that you&rsquo;ve the confidence
in me to say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You never said it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with it - you&rsquo;ve just as
good as said it.&nbsp; No: when a man leaves all his property to his
wife, without binding her hands from marrying again, he shows what a
dependence he has upon her love.&nbsp; He proves to all the world what
a wife she&rsquo;s been to him; and how, after his death, he knows she&rsquo;ll
grieve for him.&nbsp; And then, of course, a second marriage never enters
her head.&nbsp; But when she only keeps his money so long as she keeps
a widow, why, she&rsquo;s aggravated to take another husband.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure of it; many a poor woman has been driven into wedlock
again, only because she was spited into it by her husband&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only natural to suppose it.&nbsp; If I thought, Caudle, you
could do such a thing, though it would break my heart to do it, - yet,
though you were dead and gone, I&rsquo;d show you I&rsquo;d a spirit,
and marry again directly.&nbsp; Not but what it&rsquo;s ridiculous my
talking in such a way, as I shall go long before you; still, mark my
words, and don&rsquo;t provoke me with any will of that sort, or I&rsquo;d
do it - as I&rsquo;m a living woman in this bed to-night, I&rsquo;d
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I did not contradict her</i>,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;<i>but
suffered her to slumber in such assurance</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE XXXV - MRS. CAUDLE &ldquo;HAS BEEN TOLD&rdquo; THAT CAUDLE
HAS &ldquo;TAKEN TO PLAY&rdquo; AT BILLIARDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re very late to-night, dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s not late</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it isn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Of course,
a woman can never tell when it&rsquo;s late.&nbsp; You were late on
Tuesday, too; a little late on the Friday before; on the Wednesday before
that - now, you needn&rsquo;t twist about in that manner; I&rsquo;m
not going to say anything - no; for I see it&rsquo;s now no use.&nbsp;
Once, I own, it used to fret me when you stayed out; but that&rsquo;s
all over: you&rsquo;ve now brought me to that state, Caudle - and it&rsquo;s
your own fault entirely - that I don&rsquo;t care whether you ever come
home or not.&nbsp; I never thought I could be brought to think so little
of you; but you&rsquo;ve done it: you&rsquo;ve been treading on the
worm for these twenty years, and it&rsquo;s turned at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not going to quarrel; that&rsquo;s all over:
I don&rsquo;t feel enough for you to quarrel with, - I don&rsquo;t,
Caudle, as true as I&rsquo;m in this bed.&nbsp; All I want of you is
- any other man would speak to his wife, and not lie there like a log
- all I want is this.&nbsp; Just tell me where you were on Tuesday?&nbsp;
You were not at dear mother&rsquo;s, though you know she&rsquo;s not
well, and you know she thinks of leaving the dear children her money;
but you never had any feeling for anybody belonging to me.&nbsp; And
you were not at your Club: no, I know that.&nbsp; And you were not at
any theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How do I know</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, Mr. Caudle!&nbsp; I only wish I didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
No; you were not at any of these places; but I know well enough where
you were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Then why do I ask if I know</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it: just to prove what a hypocrite you are: just
to show you that you can&rsquo;t deceive me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Caudle - you&rsquo;ve turned billiard-player, sir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Only once</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite enough: you might as well play a thousand
times; for you&rsquo;re a lost man, Caudle.&nbsp; Only once, indeed!&nbsp;
I wonder, if I was to say &lsquo;Only once,&rsquo; what would you say
to me?&nbsp; But, of course, a man can do no wrong in anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a lord of the creation, Mr. Caudle; and you
can stay away from the comforts of your blessed fireside, and the society
of your own wife and children - though, to be sure, you never thought
anything of them - to push ivory balls about with a long stick upon
a green table-cloth.&nbsp; What pleasure any man can take in such stuff
must astonish any sensible woman.&nbsp; I pity you, Caudle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can go and do nothing but make &lsquo;cannons&rsquo;
- for that&rsquo;s the gibberish they talk at billiards - when there&rsquo;s
the manly and athletic game of cribbage, as my poor grandmother used
to call it, at your own hearth.&nbsp; You can go into a billiard-room
- you, a respectable tradesman, or as you set yourself up for one, for
if the world knew all, there&rsquo;s very little respectability in you
- you can go and play billiards with a set of creatures in mustachios,
when you might take a nice quiet hand with me at home.&nbsp; But no!
anything but cribbage with your own wife!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caudle, it&rsquo;s all over now; you&rsquo;ve gone to destruction.&nbsp;
I never knew a man enter a billiard-room that he wasn&rsquo;t lost for
ever.&nbsp; There was my uncle Wardle; a better man never broke the
bread of life: he took to billiards, and he didn&rsquo;t live with aunt
a month afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A lucky fellow</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you call a man who leaves his wife -
a &lsquo;lucky fellow&rsquo;?&nbsp; But, to be sure, what can I expect?&nbsp;
We shall not be together long, now: it&rsquo;s been some time coming,
but, at last, we must separate: and the wife I&rsquo;ve been to you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know who it is; it&rsquo;s that fiend Prettyman.&nbsp;
I <i>will</i> call him a fiend, and I&rsquo;m by no means a foolish
woman: you&rsquo;d no more have thought of billiards than a goose, if
it hadn&rsquo;t been for him.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s no use, Caudle,
your telling me that you have only been once, and that you can&rsquo;t
hit a ball anyhow - you&rsquo;ll soon get over all that; and then you&rsquo;ll
never be at home.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be a marked man, Caudle; yes, marked:
there&rsquo;ll be something about you that&rsquo;ll be dreadful; for
if I couldn&rsquo;t tell a billiard-player by his looks, I&rsquo;ve
no eyes, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; They all of &rsquo;em look as yellow
as parchment, and wear mustachios - I suppose you&rsquo;ll let yours
grow now; though they&rsquo;ll be a good deal troubled to come.&nbsp;
I know that.&nbsp; Yes, they&rsquo;ve all a yellow and sly look; just
for all as if they were first cousins to people that picked pockets.&nbsp;
And that will be your case, Caudle: in six months the dear children
won&rsquo;t know their own father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I know myself at all, I could have borne anything
but billiards.&nbsp; The companions you&rsquo;ll find!&nbsp; The Captains
that will be always borrowing fifty pounds of you!&nbsp; I tell you,
Caudle, a billiard-room&rsquo;s a place where ruin of all sorts is made
easy, I may say, to the lowest understanding, so you can&rsquo;t miss
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a chapel-of-ease for the devil to preach in - don&rsquo;t
tell me not to be eloquent: I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr. Caudle,
and I shall be just as eloquent as I like.&nbsp; But I never can open
my lips - and it isn&rsquo;t often, goodness knows! - that I&rsquo;m
not insulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t be quiet on this matter; I won&rsquo;t,
Caudle: on any other, I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word - and you know it
- if you didn&rsquo;t like it; but on this matter I <i>will</i> speak.&nbsp;
I know you can&rsquo;t play at billiards; and never could learn.&nbsp;
I dare say not; but that makes it all the worse, for look at the money
you&rsquo;ll lose; see the ruin you&rsquo;ll be brought to.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
no use your telling me you&rsquo;ll not play - now you can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; And nicely you&rsquo;ll be eaten up.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk
to me; dear aunt told me all about it.&nbsp; The lots of fellows that
go every day into billiard-rooms to get their dinners, just as a fox
sneaks into a farm-yard to look about him for a fat goose - and they&rsquo;ll
eat you up, Caudle; I know they will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billiard-balls, indeed!&nbsp; Well, in my time I&rsquo;ve
been over Woolwich Arsenal - you were something like a man then, for
it was just before we were married - and then I saw all sorts of balls;
mountains of &rsquo;em, to be shot away at churches, and into people&rsquo;s
peaceable habitations, breaking the china, and nobody knows what - I
say, I&rsquo;ve seen all these balls - well, I know I&rsquo;ve said
that before; but I choose to say it again - and there&rsquo;s not one
of &rsquo;em, iron as they are, that could do half the mischief of a
billiard-ball.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a ball, Caudle, that&rsquo;s gone
through many a wife&rsquo;s heart, to say nothing of her children.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s a ball, that night and day you&rsquo;ll be destroying
your family with.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ll not play!&nbsp;
When once a man&rsquo;s given to it - as my poor aunt used to say -
the devil&rsquo;s always tempting him with a ball, as he tempted Eve
with an apple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never think of being happy any more.&nbsp; No; that&rsquo;s
quite out of the question.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be there every night -
I know you will, better than you, so don&rsquo;t deny it - every night
over that wicked green cloth.&nbsp; Green, indeed!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
red, crimson red, Caudle, if you could only properly see it - crimson
red, with the hearts those balls have broken.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell
me not to be pathetic - I shall: as pathetic as it suits me.&nbsp; I
suppose I may speak.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all settled now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a billiard-player, and I&rsquo;m
a wretched woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I did not deny either position</i>,&rdquo; writes Caudle,
&ldquo;<i>and for this reason - I wanted to sleep</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LECTURE THE LAST - MRS. CAUDLE HAS TAKEN COLD; THE TRAGEDY OF THIN
SHOES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to contradict you, Caudle; you may say
what you like - but I think I ought to know my own feelings better than
you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to upbraid you neither; I&rsquo;m too
ill for that; but it&rsquo;s not getting wet in thin shoes, - oh, no!
it&rsquo;s my mind, Caudle, my mind, that&rsquo;s killing me.&nbsp;
Oh, yes! gruel, indeed you think gruel will cure a woman of anything;
and you know, too, how I hate it.&nbsp; Gruel can&rsquo;t reach what
I suffer; but, of course, nobody is ever ill but yourself.&nbsp; Well,
I - I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that; but when you talk in that way about
thin shoes, a woman says, of course, what she doesn&rsquo;t mean; she
can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve always gone on about my shoes;
when I think I&rsquo;m the fittest judge of what becomes me best.&nbsp;
I dare say, - &rsquo;twould be all the same to you if I put on ploughman&rsquo;s
boots; but I&rsquo;m not going to make a figure of my feet, I can tell
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never got cold with the shoes I&rsquo;ve worn
yet, and &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t likely I should begin now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caudle; I wouldn&rsquo;t wish to say anything to accuse
you: no, goodness knows, I wouldn&rsquo;t make you uncomfortable for
the world, - but the cold I&rsquo;ve got, I got ten years ago.&nbsp;
I have never said anything about it - but it has never left me.&nbsp;
Yes; ten years ago the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How can I recollect it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well: women remember things you never think of: poor
souls! they&rsquo;ve good cause to do so.&nbsp; Ten years ago, I was
sitting up for you, - there now, I&rsquo;m not going to say anything
to vex you, only do let me speak: ten years ago, I was waiting for you,
and I fell asleep, and the fire went out, and when I woke I found I
was sitting right in the draught of the keyhole.&nbsp; That was my death,
Caudle, though don&rsquo;t let that make you uneasy, love; for I don&rsquo;t
think you meant to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! it&rsquo;s all very well for you to call it nonsense;
and to lay your ill conduct upon my shoes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s like a
man, exactly!&nbsp; There never was a man yet that killed his wife,
who couldn&rsquo;t give a good reason for it.&nbsp; No: I don&rsquo;t
mean to say that you&rsquo;ve killed me: quite the reverse: still there&rsquo;s
never been a day that I haven&rsquo;t felt that key-hole.&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Why won&rsquo;t I have a doctor</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of a doctor?&nbsp; Why should I put you
to expense?&nbsp; Besides, I dare say you&rsquo;ll do very well without
me, Caudle: yes, after a very little time you won&rsquo;t miss me much
- no man ever does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy tells me, Miss Prettyman called to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What of it</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, of course.&nbsp; Yes; I know she heard I was ill,
and that&rsquo;s why she came.&nbsp; A little indecent, I think, Mr.
Caudle; she might wait; I shan&rsquo;t be in her way long; she may soon
have the key of the caddy, now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Mr. Caudle, what&rsquo;s the use of your calling
me your dearest soul now?&nbsp; Well, I do believe you.&nbsp; I dare
say you do mean it; that is, I hope you do.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you
can&rsquo;t expect I can lie quiet in this bed, and think of that young
woman - not, indeed, that she&rsquo;s near so young as she gives herself
out.&nbsp; I bear no malice towards her, Caudle, - not the least.&nbsp;
Still, I don&rsquo;t think I could lie at peace in my grave if - well,
I won&rsquo;t say anything more about her; but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think dear mother would keep house beautifully for you when
I&rsquo;m gone.&nbsp; Well, love, I won&rsquo;t talk in that way if
you desire it.&nbsp; Still, I know I&rsquo;ve a dreadful cold; though
I won&rsquo;t allow it for a minute to be the shoes - certainly not.&nbsp;
I never would wear &rsquo;em thick, and you know it, and they never
gave me a cold yet.&nbsp; No, dearest Caudle, it&rsquo;s ten years ago
that did it; not that I&rsquo;ll say a syllable of the matter to hurt
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d die first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you see, knows all your little ways; and you wouldn&rsquo;t
get another wife to study you and pet you up as I&rsquo;ve done - a
second wife never does; it isn&rsquo;t likely she should.&nbsp; And
after all, we&rsquo;ve been very happy.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t been my
fault if we&rsquo;ve ever had a word or two, for you couldn&rsquo;t
help now and then being aggravating; nobody can help their tempers always,
- especially men.&nbsp; Still we&rsquo;ve been very happy, haven&rsquo;t
we, Caudle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&nbsp; Yes, - this cold does tear me to pieces;
but for all that, it isn&rsquo;t the shoes.&nbsp; God bless you, Caudle;
no, - it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> the shoes.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s
the key-hole; but again I say, it&rsquo;s not the shoes.&nbsp; God bless
you once more - But never say it&rsquo;s the shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above significant sketch is a correct copy of a drawing from
the hand of Caudle at the end of this Lecture.&nbsp; It can hardly,
we think, be imagined that Mrs. Caudle, during her fatal illness, never
mixed admonishment with soothing as before; but such fragmentary Lectures
were, doubtless, considered by her disconsolate widower as having too
touching, too solemn an import to be vulgarised by type.&nbsp; They
were, however, printed on the heart of Caudle; for he never ceased to
speak of the late partner of his bed as either &ldquo;his sainted creature,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;that angel now in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>POSTSCRIPT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Our duty of editorship is closed.&nbsp; We hope we have honestly
fulfilled the task of selection from a large mass of papers.&nbsp; We
could have presented to the female world a Lecture for Every Night in
the year.&nbsp; Yes, - three hundred and sixty-five separate Lectures!&nbsp;
We trust, however, that we have done enough.&nbsp; And if we have armed
weak woman with even one argument in her unequal contest with that imperious
creature, man - if we have awarded to a sex, as Mrs. Caudle herself
was wont to declare, &ldquo;put upon from the beginning,&rdquo; the
slightest means of defence - if we have supplied a solitary text to
meet any one of the manifold wrongs with which woman, in her household
life, is continually pressed by her tyrannic taskmaster, man, - we feel
that we have only paid back one grain, hardly one, of that mountain
of more than gold it is our felicity to owe her.</p>
<p>During the progress of these Lectures, it has very often pained us,
and that excessively, to hear from unthinking, inexperienced men - bachelors
of course - that every woman, no matter how divinely composed, has in
her ichor-flowing veins one drop - &ldquo;no bigger than a wren&rsquo;s
eye&rdquo; - of Caudle; that Eve herself may now and then have been
guilty of a lecture, murmuring it balmily amongst the rose-leaves.&nbsp;
It may be so; still, be it our pride never to believe it.&nbsp; NEVER!</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to

above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
