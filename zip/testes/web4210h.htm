<h1>
The Good News According to Luke
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Since many have undertaken
to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been
fulfilled among us,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> even
as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
delivered them to us,  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> it
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately
from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
 <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> There was in the days
of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and
her name was Elizabeth.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> They were both righteous before
God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> But they had no
child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Now it happened,
while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his
division,  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> according to the
custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the
Lord and burn incense.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> The whole multitude of the people
were praying outside at the hour of incense.
<p> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> An angel of the Lord
appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
 <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Zacharias was troubled
when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> But the angel said to him,
&quot;Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and
your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name
John.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> You will have joy
and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> For he will be great in the sight
of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> He will turn many of the children
of Israel to the Lord, their God.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> He will go before him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Zacharias said to the
angel, &quot;How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife
is well advanced in years.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> The angel answered
him, &quot;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to
speak to you, and to bring you this good news.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Behold, you will be silent and
not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because
you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper
time.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> The people were
waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
 <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> When he came out, he
could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in
the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> It happened, when the days of his
service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> After these days Elizabeth, his
wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> &quot;Thus has the Lord done to
me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among
men.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> Now in the sixth
month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named
Nazareth,  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David. The virgin's name was Mary.  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> Having come in, the angel said to
her, &quot;Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed
are you among women!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> But when she saw him,
she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of
salutation this might be.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> The angel said to her,
&quot;Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> Behold, you will conceive in your
womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of
his father, David,  <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> and he
will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his
Kingdom.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> Mary said to the
angel, &quot;How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> The angel answered
her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most
High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you
will be called the Son of God.  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> Behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with
her who was called barren.  <a name="C1V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:37</font></a> For everything spoken by God is
possible.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> Mary said,
&quot;Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your
word.&quot;
<p>The angel departed from her.  <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> Mary arose in those days and went
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,  <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> and entered into the house of
Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.  <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> It happened, when Elizabeth heard
Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit.  <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> She called out with a loud voice,
and said, &quot;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
your womb!  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> Why am I so
favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> For behold, when the voice of
your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
 <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> Blessed is she who
believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been
spoken to her from the Lord!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:46</font></a> Mary said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;My soul magnifies the Lord.
<dd> <a name="C1V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:47</font></a> My spirit has
rejoiced in God my Savior,
<dd> <a name="C1V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:48</font></a> for he has looked at
the humble state of his handmaid.
<dt>For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
<dd> <a name="C1V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:49</font></a> For he who is mighty
has done great things for me.
<dd>Holy is his name.
<dd> <a name="C1V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:50</font></a> His mercy is for
generations of generations on those who fear him.
<dt> <a name="C1V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:51</font></a> He has shown strength
with his arm.
<dd>He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
<dt> <a name="C1V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:52</font></a> He has put down
princes from their thrones.
<dd>And has exalted the lowly.
<dt> <a name="C1V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:53</font></a> He has filled the
hungry with good things.
<dd>He has sent the rich away empty.
<dt> <a name="C1V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:54</font></a> He has given help to
Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
<dd> <a name="C1V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:55</font></a> As he spoke to our
fathers,
<dd>to Abraham and his seed forever.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:56</font></a> Mary stayed with her
about three months, and then returned to her house.  <a name="C1V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:57</font></a> Now the time that Elizabeth
should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.  <a name="C1V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:58</font></a> Her neighbors and her relatives
heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced
with her.  <a name="C1V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:59</font></a> It happened on
the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would
have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.  <a name="C1V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:60</font></a> His mother answered, &quot;Not
so; but he will be called John.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:61</font></a> They said to her,
&quot;There is no one among your relatives who is called by this
name.&quot;  <a name="C1V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:62</font></a> They made
signs to his father, what he would have him called.
<p> <a name="C1V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:63</font></a> He asked for a writing
tablet, and wrote, &quot;His name is John.&quot;
<p>They all marveled.  <a name="C1V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:64</font></a> His
mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing
God.  <a name="C1V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:65</font></a> Fear came on all who
lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all
the hill country of Judea.  <a name="C1V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:66</font></a> All who heard them laid them up
in their heart, saying, &quot;What then will this child be?&quot; The hand
of the Lord was with him.  <a name="C1V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:67</font></a> His father, Zacharias, was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:68</font></a> &quot;Blessed be the
Lord, the God of Israel,
<dd>for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
<dt> <a name="C1V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:69</font></a> and has raised up a
horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
<dd> <a name="C1V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:70</font></a> (as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),
<dd> <a name="C1V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:71</font></a> salvation from our
enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
<dt> <a name="C1V72"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:72</font></a> to show mercy towards
our fathers,
<dd>to remember his holy covenant,
<dt> <a name="C1V73"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:73</font></a> the oath which he
spoke to Abraham, our father,
<dd> <a name="C1V74"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:74</font></a> to grant to us that
we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
<dd>should serve him without fear,
<dd> <a name="C1V75"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:75</font></a> In holiness and
righteousness before him all the days of our life.
<dt> <a name="C1V76"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:76</font></a> And you, child, will
be called a prophet of the Most High,
<dd>for you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,
<dd> <a name="C1V77"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:77</font></a> to give knowledge of
salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
<dt> <a name="C1V78"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:78</font></a> because of the tender
mercy of our God,
<dd>whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
<dd> <a name="C1V79"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:79</font></a> to shine on those who
sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
<dd>to guide our feet into the way of peace.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V80"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:80</font></a> The child was growing,
and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his
public appearance to Israel.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now it happened in
those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be enrolled.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> This
was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
 <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> All went to enroll
themselves, everyone to his own city.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Joseph also went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is
called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> to enroll himself with Mary, who
was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
<p> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> It happened, while they
were there, that the day had come that she should give birth.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> She brought forth her firstborn
son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding
trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> There were shepherds in the same
country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Behold, an angel of the
Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they
were terrified.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> The angel
said to them, &quot;Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of
great joy which will be to all the people.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For there is born to you, this
day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> This is the sign to you: you will
find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.&quot;
 <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Suddenly, there was with
the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> &quot;Glory to God in
the highest,
<dd>on earth peace, good will toward men.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> It happened, when the
angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to
another, &quot;Let's go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has
happened, which the Lord has made known to us.&quot;  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> They came with haste, and found
both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
 <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> When they saw it, they
publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
 <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> All who heard it wondered
at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> But Mary kept all these sayings,
pondering them in her heart.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and
seen, just as it was told them.
<p> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> When eight days were
fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus,
which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
<p> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> When the days of their
purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought
him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> (as it is written in the law of
the Lord, &quot;Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the
Lord&quot;),<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> and to offer a sacrifice
according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, &quot;A pair of
turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> Behold, there was a
man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout,
looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
 <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> It had been revealed to
him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the
Lord's <a href="#N3">Christ.</a>  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> He came in the Spirit into the
temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do
concerning him according to the custom of the law,  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> then he received him into his
arms, and blessed God, and said,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> &quot;Now you are
releasing your servant, Master,
<dd>according to your word, in peace;
<dt> <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> for my eyes have seen
your salvation,
<dd> <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> which you have
prepared before the face of all peoples;
<dt> <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> a light for
revelation to the nations,
<dd>and the glory of your people Israel.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> Joseph and his mother
were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,  <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> and Simeon blessed them, and said
to Mary, his mother, &quot;Behold, this child is set for the falling and
the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.
 <a name="C2V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:35</font></a> Yes, a sword will pierce
through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:36</font></a> There was one Anna, a
prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a
great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
 <a name="C2V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:37</font></a> and she had been a widow
for about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple,
worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.  <a name="C2V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:38</font></a> Coming up at that very hour, she
gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking
for redemption in Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C2V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:39</font></a> When they had
accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they
returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.  <a name="C2V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:40</font></a> The child was growing, and was
becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God
was upon him.  <a name="C2V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:41</font></a> His parents
went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
<p> <a name="C2V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:42</font></a> When he was twelve
years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
 <a name="C2V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:43</font></a> and when they had
fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in
Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it,  <a name="C2V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:44</font></a> but supposing him to be in the
company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their
relatives and acquaintances.  <a name="C2V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:45</font></a> When they didn't find him, they
returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.  <a name="C2V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:46</font></a> It happened after three days they
found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both
listening to them, and asking them questions.  <a name="C2V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:47</font></a> All who heard him were amazed at
his understanding and his answers.  <a name="C2V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:48</font></a> When they saw him, they were
astonished, and his mother said to him, &quot;Son, why have you treated us
this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:49</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must
be in my Father's house?&quot;  <a name="C2V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:50</font></a> They didn't understand the saying
which he spoke to them.  <a name="C2V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:51</font></a> And he went down with them, and
came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these
sayings in her heart.  <a name="C2V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:52</font></a> And
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of
Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip
tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch
of Abilene,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> in the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of
Zacharias, in the wilderness.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> He came into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
 <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> As it is written in the
book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>'Make ready the way of the Lord.
<dt>Make his paths straight.
<dd> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Every valley will be
filled.
<dt>Every mountain and hill will be brought low.
<dd>The crooked will become straight,
<dd>and the rough ways smooth.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> All flesh will see
God's salvation.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> He said therefore to
the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, &quot;You offspring of
vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Bring forth therefore fruits
worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have
Abraham for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up
children to Abraham from these stones!  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Even now the axe also lies at the
root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good
fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> The multitudes asked
him, &quot;What then must we do?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has
food, let him do likewise.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Tax collectors also
came to be baptized, and they said to him, &quot;Teacher, what must we
do?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Soldiers also asked
him, saying, &quot;What about us? What must we do?&quot;
<p>He said to them, &quot;Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> As the people were in
expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether
perhaps he was the Christ,  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> John answered them all, &quot;I
indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the
latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in
the Holy Spirit and fire,  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> whose fan is in his hand, and he
will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat
into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Then with many other
exhortations he preached good news to the people,  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> but Herod the tetrarch, being
reproved by him for Herodias, his <a href="#N5">brother's</a> wife, and
for all the evil things which Herod had done,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> added this also to them all, that
he shut up John in prison.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Now it happened, when all the
people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The
sky was opened,  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> and the
Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came
out of the sky, saying &quot;You are my beloved Son. In you I am well
pleased.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Jesus himself, when he
began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was

<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Jesus, full of the Holy
Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> for forty days,
being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when
they were completed, he was hungry.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> The devil said to him, &quot;If
you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Jesus answered him,
saying, &quot;It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread

<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> The devil, leading him
up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a
moment of time.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> The devil
said to him, &quot;I will give you all this authority, and their glory,
for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> If you therefore will worship
before me, it will all be yours.&quot;

power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all
the surrounding area.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> He
taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
<p> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> He came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the
synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> The book of the prophet Isaiah
was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was
written,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
<dd>because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.

size=-1><sup><a href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> He closed the book,
gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the
synagogue were fastened on him.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> He began to tell them, &quot;Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your
hearing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> All testified about
him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,
and they said, &quot;Isn't this Joseph's son?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal
yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your
hometown.'&quot;  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> He said, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his
hometown.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> But truly I
tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the
sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over
all the land.  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> Elijah was
sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a
woman who was a widow.  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> There were many lepers in Israel
in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed,
except Naaman, the Syrian.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> They were all filled
with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> They rose up, threw him out of
the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built
on, that they might throw him off the cliff.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> But he, passing through the midst
of them, went his way.
<p> <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> He came down to
Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
 <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> and they were astonished
at his teaching, for his word was with authority.  <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> In the synagogue there was a man
who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
 <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> saying, &quot;Ah! what
have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I
know you who you are: the Holy One of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:35</font></a> Jesus rebuked him,
saying, &quot;Be silent, and come out of him!&quot;
When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him,
having done him no harm.
<p> <a name="C4V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:36</font></a> Amazement came on all,
and they spoke together, one with another, saying, &quot;What is this
word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and
they come out!&quot;  <a name="C4V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:37</font></a> News
about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
<p> <a name="C4V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:38</font></a> He rose up from the
synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was
afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.  <a name="C4V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:39</font></a> He stood over her, and rebuked
the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
 <a name="C4V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:40</font></a> When the sun was setting,
all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and
he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.  <a name="C4V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:41</font></a> Demons also came out from many,
crying out, and saying, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of God!&quot;
Rebuking them, he didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that he
was the Christ.
<p> <a name="C4V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:42</font></a> When it was day, he
departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for
him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn't go away from
them.  <a name="C4V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:43</font></a> But he said to
them, &quot;I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of
God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been
sent.&quot;  <a name="C4V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:44</font></a> He was
preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Now it happened, while
the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was
standing by the lake of Gennesaret.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> He saw two boats standing by the
lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
 <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land.
He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, &quot;Put out into the deep, and let down
your nets for a catch.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Simon answered him,
&quot;Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I
will let down the net.&quot;  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> When they had done this, they
caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> They beckoned to their partners in
the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled
both boats, so that they began to sink.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> But Simon Peter, when he saw it,
fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, &quot;Depart from me, for I am a sinful
man, Lord.&quot;  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> For he
was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had
caught;  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> and so also were
James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
<p>Jesus said to Simon, &quot;Don't be afraid. From now on
you will be catching people alive.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> When they had brought
their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> It happened, while he was in one
of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus,
he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, &quot;Lord, if you want to,
you can make me clean.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> He stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, &quot;I want to. Be made
clean.&quot;
<p>Immediately the leprosy left him.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> He commanded him to tell no one,
&quot;But go your way, and show yourself to the priest,
and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.&quot;  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> But the report concerning him
spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be
healed by him of their infirmities.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> But he withdrew himself into the
desert, and prayed.
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> It happened on one of
those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of
the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea,
and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Behold, men brought a paralyzed
man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Not finding a way to bring him in
because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down
through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Seeing their faith, he said to
him, &quot;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> The scribes and the
Pharisees began to reason, saying, &quot;Who is this that speaks
blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> But Jesus, perceiving
their thoughts, answered them, &quot;Why are you reasoning
so in your hearts?  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> Which
is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and
walk?'  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> But that you may
know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins&quot; (he said to the paralyzed man), &quot;I
tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Immediately he rose up
before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his
house, glorifying God.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Amazement took hold on all, and
they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, &quot;We have seen
strange things today.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> After these things he
went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office,
and said to him, &quot;Follow me!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> He left everything,
and rose up and followed him.  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> Levi made a great feast for him
in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who
were reclining with them.  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> Their scribes and the Pharisees
murmured against his disciples, saying, &quot;Why do you eat and drink
with the tax collectors and sinners?&quot;  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> Jesus answered them, &quot;Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but
those who are sick do.  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> I
have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:34</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the
bridegroom is with them?  <a name="C5V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:35</font></a> But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
days.&quot;  <a name="C5V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:36</font></a> He
also told a parable to them. &quot;No one puts a piece
from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and
also the piece from the new will not match the old.  <a name="C5V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:37</font></a> No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be
spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.  <a name="C5V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:38</font></a> But new wine must be put into
fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.  <a name="C5V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:39</font></a> No man having drunk old wine
immediately desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Now it happened on the
second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain
fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in
their hands.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> But some of
the Pharisees said to them, &quot;Why do you do that which is not lawful
to do on the Sabbath day?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Jesus, answering them,
said, &quot;Haven't you read what David did when he was
hungry, he, and those who were with him;  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> how he entered into the house of
God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with
him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?&quot;
 <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> He said to them, &quot;The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> It also happened on
another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a
man there, and his right hand was withered.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> The scribes and the Pharisees
watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might
find an accusation against him.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> But he knew their thoughts; and he
said to the man who had the withered hand, &quot;Rise up,
and stand in the middle.&quot; He arose and stood.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Then Jesus said to them, &quot;I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to
do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?&quot;  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> He looked around at them all, and
said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot;
He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> But they were filled with rage,
and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.
<p> <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> It happened in these
days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night
in prayer to God.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> When it
was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he
also named apostles:  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Simon, whom he also named Peter;
Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Matthew; Thomas; James, the son
of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> Judas the son of James; and Judas
Iscariot, who also became a traitor.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> He came down with them, and stood
on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> as well as those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> All the multitude sought to touch
him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
<p> <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> He lifted up his eyes
to his disciples, and said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Blessed are you who are poor,
<dd>for yours is the Kingdom of God.
<dt> <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Blessed are you who

out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.
<dd> <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> Rejoice in that day,

</dl>
<p> <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> &quot;But I tell you who hear:
love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> bless those who curse you, and
pray for those who mistreat you.  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> To him who strikes you on the
cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't
withhold your coat also.  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> Give to everyone who asks you,
and don't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.
<p> <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> &quot;As you would like people to
do to you, do exactly so to them.  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> If you love those who love you,
what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
 <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> If you do good to those
who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the
same.  <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> If you lend to
those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even
sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.  <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> But love your enemies, and do
good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and
you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the
unthankful and evil.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> Therefore be merciful,
<dd>even as your Father is also merciful.

measure it will be measured back to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:39</font></a> He spoke a parable to
them. &quot;Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both
fall into a pit?  <a name="C6V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:40</font></a> A
disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained
will be like his teacher.  <a name="C6V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:41</font></a> Why do you see the speck of chaff
that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your
own eye?  <a name="C6V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:42</font></a> Or how can you
tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in
your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can
see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye.
 <a name="C6V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:43</font></a> For there is no good tree
that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth
good fruit.  <a name="C6V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:44</font></a> For each tree
is known by its own fruit. For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor
do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.  <a name="C6V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:45</font></a> The good man out of the good
treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out
of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out
of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
<p> <a name="C6V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:46</font></a> &quot;Why do you call me, 'Lord,
Lord,' and don't do the things which I say?  <a name="C6V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:47</font></a> Everyone who comes to me, and
hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.  <a name="C6V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:48</font></a> He is like a man building a
house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a
flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
because it was founded on the rock.  <a name="C6V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:49</font></a> But he who hears, and doesn't do,
is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against
which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that
house was great.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> After he had finished
speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> A certain centurion's servant, who
was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> When he heard about Jesus, he sent
to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.
 <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> When they came to Jesus,
they begged him earnestly, saying, &quot;He is worthy for you to do this
for him,  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> for he loves our
nation, and he built our synagogue for us.&quot;  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Jesus went with them. When he was
now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, &quot;Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to
come under my roof.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Therefore I didn't even think
myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be
healed.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> For I also am a
man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one,
'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my
servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> When Jesus heard these
things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who
followed him, &quot;I tell you, I have not found such
great faith, no, not in Israel.&quot;  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Those who were sent, returning to
the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
<p> <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> It happened soon
afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples,
along with a great multitude, went with him.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Now when he drew near to the gate
of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
 <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> When the Lord saw her, he
had compassion on her, and said to her, &quot;Don't
cry.&quot;  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> He came
near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, &quot;Young man, I tell you, arise!&quot;  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> He who was dead sat up, and began
to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
<p> <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Fear took hold of all,
and they glorified God, saying, &quot;A great prophet has arisen among
us!&quot; and, &quot;God has visited his people!&quot;  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> This report went out concerning
him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
<p> <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> The disciples of John
told him about all these things.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> John, calling to himself two of
his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, &quot;Are you the one who is
coming, or should we look for another?&quot;  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> When the men had come to him,
they said, &quot;John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> In that hour he cured
many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind
he gave sight.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Jesus
answered them, &quot;Go and tell John the things which you
have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have good news preached to them.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Blessed is he who is not offended
by me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> When John's messengers
had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, &quot;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken by the wind?  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> But
what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those
who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
 <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> But what did you go out
to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> This is he of whom it is written,
<dl>
<dt>'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N16">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> &quot;For I tell you, among those
who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the
Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than
he.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> When all the people
and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having
been baptized with John's baptism.  <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> But the Pharisees and the lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.
<p> <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> <font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>&quot;To
what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
 <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> They are like children
who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to
you, and you didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> For John the Baptizer came
neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
 <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> The Son of Man has come
eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a
drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'  <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> Wisdom is justified by all her
children.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> One of the Pharisees
invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat
at the table.  <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> Behold, a
woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in
the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.  <a name="C7V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:38</font></a> Standing behind at his feet
weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with
the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment.  <a name="C7V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:39</font></a> Now when the
Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, &quot;This man,
if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this
is who touches him, that she is a sinner.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:40</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Simon, I have something to tell you.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Teacher, say on.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:41</font></a> &quot;A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five
hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  <a name="C7V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:42</font></a> When they couldn't pay, he
forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:43</font></a> Simon answered,
&quot;He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;You have judged
correctly.&quot;  <a name="C7V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:44</font></a> Turning to the woman, he said to
Simon, &quot;Do you see this woman? I entered into your
house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with
her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.  <a name="C7V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:45</font></a> You gave me no kiss, but she,
since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.  <a name="C7V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:46</font></a> You didn't anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.  <a name="C7V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:47</font></a> Therefore I tell you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, the same loves little.&quot;  <a name="C7V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:48</font></a> He said to her, &quot;Your sins are forgiven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:49</font></a> Those who sat at the
table with him began to say to themselves, &quot;Who is this who even
forgives sins?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:50</font></a> He said to the woman,
&quot;Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> It happened soon
afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and
bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,
 <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> and certain women who had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas,
Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served <a
href="#N18">them</a> from their possessions.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> When a great multitude came
together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a
parable.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> &quot;The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some
fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the
sky devoured it.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Other
seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because
it had no moisture.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Other
fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> Other fell into the good ground,
and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.&quot; As he
said these things, he called out, &quot;He who has ears to
hear, let him hear!&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Then his disciples
asked him, &quot;What does this parable mean?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> He said, &quot;To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N19">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Now the parable is this: The seed
is the word of God.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Those
along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away
the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Those on the rock are they who,
when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who
believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> That which fell among the thorns,
these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are
choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to
maturity.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> That in the
good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
<p> <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> &quot;No one, when he has lit a
lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a
stand, that those who enter in may see the light.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> For nothing is hidden, that will
not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to
light.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Be careful
therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever
doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he
has.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> His mother and
brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
 <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> It was told him by some
saying, &quot;Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> But he answered them,
&quot;My mother and my brothers are these who hear the
word of God, and do it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Now it happened on one
of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and
he said to them, &quot;Let's go over to the other side of
the lake.&quot; So they launched out.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> But as they sailed, he fell
asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on
dangerous amounts of water.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> They came to him, and awoke him,
saying, &quot;Master, master, we are dying!&quot; He awoke, and rebuked
the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
 <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Where is your faith?&quot; Being afraid they
marveled, saying one to another, &quot;Who is this, then, that he commands
even the winds and the water, and they obey him?&quot;  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> They arrived at the country of
the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<p> <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> When Jesus stepped
ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met
him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.
 <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> When he saw Jesus, he
cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said,
&quot;What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God?
I beg you, don't torment me!&quot;  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> For Jesus was commanding the
unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often
seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and
fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the
desert.
<p> <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Legion,&quot; for many demons had entered into him.
 <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> They begged him that he
would not command them to go into the abyss.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> Now there was there a herd of
many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow
them to enter into those. He allowed them.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> The demons came out from the man,
and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake, and were drowned.  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> When those who fed them saw what
had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
<p> <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> People went out to see
what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the
demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid.  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> Those who saw it told them how he
who had been possessed by demons was healed.  <a name="C8V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:37</font></a> All the people of the surrounding
country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very
much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.  <a name="C8V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:38</font></a> But the man from whom the demons
had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him
away, saying,  <a name="C8V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:39</font></a> &quot;Return to your house, and declare what great things God
has done for you.&quot; He went his way, proclaiming throughout the
whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
<p> <a name="C8V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:40</font></a> It happened, when
Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting
for him.  <a name="C8V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:41</font></a> Behold, there
came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down
at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,  <a name="C8V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:42</font></a> for he had an only daughter,
about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the
multitudes pressed against him.  <a name="C8V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:43</font></a> A woman who had a flow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could
not be healed by any,  <a name="C8V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:44</font></a> came behind him, and touched the
<a href="#N20">fringe</a> of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her
blood stopped.  <a name="C8V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:45</font></a> Jesus
said, &quot;Who touched me?&quot;
<p>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, &quot;Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched
me?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:46</font></a> But Jesus said, &quot;Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone
out of me.&quot;  <a name="C8V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:47</font></a> When the woman saw that she was
not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to
him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him,
and how she was healed immediately.  <a name="C8V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:48</font></a> He said to her, &quot;Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in
peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:49</font></a> While he still spoke,
one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him,
&quot;Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the Teacher.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:50</font></a> But Jesus hearing it,
answered him, &quot;Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she
will be healed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:51</font></a> When he came to the
house, he didn't allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the
father of the child, and her mother.  <a name="C8V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:52</font></a> All were weeping and mourning
her, but he said, &quot;Don't weep. She isn't dead, but
sleeping.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:53</font></a> They were ridiculing
him, knowing that she was dead.  <a name="C8V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:54</font></a> But he put them all outside, and
taking her by the hand, he called, saying, &quot;Child,
arise!&quot;  <a name="C8V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:55</font></a> Her
spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something
be given to her to eat.  <a name="C8V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:56</font></a> Her parents were amazed, but he
commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> He called <a
href="#N21">the twelve</a> together, and gave them power and authority
over all demons, and to cure diseases.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> He sent them forth to preach the
Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet,
nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Into whatever house you enter,
stay there, and depart from there.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> As many as don't receive you, when
you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a
testimony against them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> They departed, and went
throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
 <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Now Herod the tetrarch
heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it
was said by some that John had risen from the dead,  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> and by some that Elijah had
appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
 <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Herod said, &quot;John I
beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?&quot; He sought
to see him.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> The apostles,
when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
<p>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called
Bethsaida.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> But the
multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to
them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> The day began to wear away; and
the twelve came, and said to him, &quot;Send the multitude away, that they
may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food,
for we are here in a deserted place.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> But he said to them,
&quot;You give them something to eat.&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless
we should go and buy food for all these people.&quot;  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> For they were about five thousand
men.
<p>He said to his disciples, &quot;Make them sit down in
groups of about fifty each.&quot;  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> They did so, and made them all
sit down.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them,
and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the
multitude.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> They ate, and
were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that
were left over.
<p> <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> It happened, as he was
praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, &quot;Who do the multitudes say that I am?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> They answered,
&quot;'John the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one
of the old prophets is risen again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> He said to them, &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot;
<p>Peter answered, &quot;The Christ of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> But he warned them,
and commanded them to tell this to no one,  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> saying, &quot;The
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised
up.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> He said to all, &quot;If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself,
take up his cross,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N22">*</a></sup></font> and follow me.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same
will save it.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> For what
does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits
his own self?  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> For whoever
will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be
ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of
the holy angels.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> But I
tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no
way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> It happened about
eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and
James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> As he was praying, the appearance
of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
 <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> Behold, two men were
talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> who appeared in glory, and spoke
of his <a href="#N23">departure,</a> which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> Now Peter and those
who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake,
they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> It happened, as they were parting
from him, that Peter said to Jesus, &quot;Master, it is good for us to be
here. Let's make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for
Elijah,&quot; not knowing what he said.
<p> <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> While he said these
things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they
entered into the cloud.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, &quot;This is my beloved Son. Listen
to him!&quot;  <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> When the
voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in
those days any of the things which they had seen.
<p> <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> It happened on the
next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great
multitude met him.  <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> Behold, a man from the crowd
called out, saying, &quot;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is
my only child.  <a name="C9V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:39</font></a> Behold, a
spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he
foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.  <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> I begged your disciples to cast
it out, and they couldn't.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be
with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:42</font></a> While he was still
coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his
father.  <a name="C9V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:43</font></a> They were all
astonished at the majesty of God.
<p>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said
to his disciples,  <a name="C9V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:44</font></a> &quot;Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man
will be delivered up into the hands of men.&quot;  <a name="C9V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:45</font></a> But they didn't understand this
saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and
they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
<p> <a name="C9V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:46</font></a> There arose an
argument among them about which of them was the greatest.  <a name="C9V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:47</font></a> Jesus, perceiving the reasoning
of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,  <a name="C9V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:48</font></a> and said to them, &quot;Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.
Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among
you all, this one will be great.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:49</font></a> John answered,
&quot;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we
forbade him, because he doesn't follow with us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:50</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Don't forbid him, for he who is not against us is
for us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:51</font></a> It came to pass, when
the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to
go to Jerusalem,  <a name="C9V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:52</font></a> and sent
messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the
Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.  <a name="C9V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:53</font></a> They didn't receive him, because
he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:54</font></a> When his disciples, James and
John, saw this, they said, &quot;Lord, do you want us to command fire to
come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:55</font></a> But he turned and
rebuked them, &quot;You don't know of what kind of spirit
you are.  <a name="C9V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:56</font></a> For the Son of
Man didn't come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.&quot;
<p>They went to another village.  <a name="C9V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:57</font></a> As they went on the way, a
certain man said to him, &quot;I want to follow you wherever you go,
Lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:58</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:59</font></a> He said to another,
&quot;Follow me!&quot;
<p>But he said, &quot;Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:60</font></a> But Jesus said to him,
&quot;Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go
and announce the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:61</font></a> Another also said,
&quot;I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to
those who are at my house.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:62</font></a> But Jesus said to him,
&quot;No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now after these
things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two
<a href="#N24">ahead of him</a> into every city and place, where he was
about to come.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Then he
said to them, &quot;The harvest is indeed plentiful, but
the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he
may send out laborers into his harvest.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Go your ways. Behold, I send you
out as lambs among wolves.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor
sandals. Greet no one on the way.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Into whatever house you enter,
first say, 'Peace be to this house.'  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> If a son of peace is there, your
peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Remain in that same house, eating
and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
Don't go from house to house.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Into whatever city you enter, and
they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Heal the sick who are therein,
and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> But into whatever city you
enter, and they don't receive you, go out into its streets and say,
 <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> 'Even the dust from your
city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this,
that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.'  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> I tell you, it will be more
tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
<p> <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> &quot;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe
to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> But
it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
 <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> You, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down to <a href="#N25">Hades.</a>
 <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Whoever listens to you
listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me
rejects him who sent me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> The seventy returned
with joy, saying, &quot;Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from
heaven.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Behold, I give
you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power
of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Nevertheless, don't rejoice in
this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> In that same hour
Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, &quot;I thank
you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things
from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> Turning to the
disciples, he said, &quot;All things have been delivered
to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and
who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to
reveal him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> Turning to the
disciples, he said privately, &quot;Blessed are the eyes
which see the things that you see,  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> for I tell you that many
prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see
them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear
them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Behold, a certain
lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, &quot;Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> He said to him, &quot;What is written in the law? How do you read
it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> He answered,
&quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N26">*</a></sup></font> and your neighbor as
yourself.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N27">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> He said to him, &quot;You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will
live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> But he, desiring to
justify himself, asked Jesus, &quot;Who is my neighbor?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and
departed, leaving him half dead.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> By chance a certain priest was
going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
 <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> In the same way a Levite
also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
 <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> But a certain Samaritan,
as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
compassion,  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> came to him,
and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own
animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> On the next day, when he
departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to
him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you
when I return.'  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> Now
which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell
among the robbers?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> He said, &quot;He who
showed mercy on him.&quot;
<p>Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Go and do
likewise.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> It happened as they
went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman
named Martha received him into her house.  <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> She had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and she came up to him, and said, &quot;Lord, don't you care
that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> Jesus answered her,
&quot;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about
many things,  <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> but one
thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken
away from her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> It happened, that when
he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,
&quot;Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> He said to them, &quot;When you pray, say,
<dl>
<dt>'Our Father in heaven,
<dd>may your name be kept holy.
<dt>May your Kingdom come.
<dd>May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.
<dt> <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> Give us day by day
our daily bread.
<dt> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Forgive us our sins,
<dd>for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
<dt>Bring us not into temptation,
<dd>but deliver us from the evil one.'&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell
him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> for a friend of mine has come to
me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> and he from within will answer
and say, 'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with
me in bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> I tell you, although he will not
rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his
persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
<p> <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> &quot;I tell you, keep asking,
and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking,
and it will be opened to you.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> For everyone who asks receives.
He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
<p> <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> &quot;Which of you fathers, if
your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish,
he won't give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Or if he asks for an egg, he
won't give him a scorpion, will he?  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> If you then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> He was casting out a
demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute
man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> But some of them said, &quot;He
casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.&quot;  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Others, testing him, sought from
him a sign from heaven.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> But he, knowing their thoughts,
said to them, &quot;Every kingdom divided against itself
is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebul.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> But if I cast
out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
will they be your judges.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> But if I by the finger of God
cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
<p> <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> &quot;When the strong man, fully
armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> But when someone stronger
attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which
he trusted, and divides his spoils.
<p> <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> &quot;He that is not with me is
against me. He who doesn't gather with me scatters.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> The unclean spirit, when he has
gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'
 <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> When he returns, he
finds it swept and put in order.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Then he goes, and takes seven
other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.
The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> It came to pass, as
he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her
voice, and said to him, &quot;Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the
breasts which nursed you!&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> But he said, &quot;On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of
God, and keep it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> When the multitudes
were gathering together to him, he began to say, &quot;This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will
be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> For even as Jonah became a sign
to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
 <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> The Queen of the South
will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will
condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> The men of Nineveh will stand up
in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is
here.
<p> <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> &quot;No one, when he has lit a
lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those
who come in may see the light.  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light;
but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.  <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> Therefore see whether the light
that is in you isn't darkness.  <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> If therefore your whole body is
full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as
when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:37</font></a> Now as he spoke, a
certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the
table.  <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> When the Pharisee
saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
 <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> The Lord said to him,
&quot;Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and
of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
 <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> You foolish ones, didn't
he who made the outside make the inside also?  <a name="C11V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:41</font></a> But give for gifts to the needy
those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to
you.  <a name="C11V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:42</font></a> But woe to you
Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass
justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have
left the other undone.  <a name="C11V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:43</font></a> Woe to you Pharisees! For you
love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
marketplaces.  <a name="C11V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:44</font></a> Woe to
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves,
and the men who walk over them don't know it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:45</font></a> One of the lawyers
answered him, &quot;Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:46</font></a> He said, &quot;Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens
that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger
to help carry those burdens.  <a name="C11V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:47</font></a> Woe to you! For you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  <a name="C11V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:48</font></a> So you testify and consent to
the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their
tombs.  <a name="C11V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:49</font></a> Therefore also
the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and
some of them they will kill and persecute,  <a name="C11V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:50</font></a> that the blood of all the
prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation;  <a name="C11V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:51</font></a> from
the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the
altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this
generation.  <a name="C11V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:52</font></a> Woe to you
lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in
yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:53</font></a> As he said these
things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry,
and to draw many things out of him;  <a name="C11V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:54</font></a> lying in wait for him, and
seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Meanwhile, when a
multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they
trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, &quot;Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
 <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> But there is nothing
covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Therefore whatever you
have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken
in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.
<p> <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> &quot;I tell you, my friends,
don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more
that they can do.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> But I
will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has
power to cast into <a href="#N28">Gehenna.</a> Yes, I tell you, fear him.
<p> <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> &quot;Aren't five sparrows sold
for two <a href="#N29">assaria coins</a>? Not one of them is forgotten by
God.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> But the very hairs
of your head are all numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more
value than many sparrows.
<p> <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> &quot;I tell you, everyone who
confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the
angels of God;  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> but he who
denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the
angels of God.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Everyone
who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who
blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> When they bring you before the
synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what
you will answer, or what you will say;  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> for the Holy Spirit will teach
you in that same hour what you must say.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> One of the multitude
said to him, &quot;Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> But he said to him,
&quot;Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over
you?&quot;  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> He
said to them, &quot;Beware! Keep yourselves from
covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the
things which he possesses.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> He spoke a parable to
them, saying, &quot;The ground of a certain rich man
brought forth abundantly.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> He reasoned within himself,
saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'
 <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> He said, 'This is what I
will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I
will store all my grain and my goods.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> I will tell my soul, &quot;Soul,
you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be
merry.&quot;'
<p> <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> &quot;But God said to him, 'You
foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you
have prepared--whose will they be?'  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> So is he who lays up treasure
for himself, and is not rich toward God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> He said to his
disciples, &quot;Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious
for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will
wear.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Life is more than
food, and the body is more than clothing.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> Consider the ravens: they don't
sow, they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them.
How much more valuable are you than birds!  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Which of you by being anxious
can add a cubit to his height?  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> If then you aren't able to do
even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> Consider the lilies, how they
grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> But if this is how God clothes
the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> Don't seek what you will eat or
what you will drink; neither be anxious.  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> For the nations of the world
seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
things.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> But seek God's
Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Don't be afraid, little flock,
for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> Sell that which you have, and
give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old,
a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches,
neither moth destroys.  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.
<p> <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> &quot;Let your waist be girded
and your lamps burning.  <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> Be like men watching for their
lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and
knocks, they may immediately open to him.  <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> Blessed are those servants, whom
the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that
he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve
them.  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> They will be
blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
 <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> But know this, that if
the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he
would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.  <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> Therefore be ready also, for the
Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> Peter said to him,
&quot;Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> The Lord said, &quot;Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord
will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the
right times?  <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> Blessed is
that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.  <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> Truly I tell you, that he will
set him over all that he has.  <a name="C12V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:45</font></a> But if that servant says in his
heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and
the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,  <a name="C12V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:46</font></a> then the lord of that servant
will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he
doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
unfaithful.  <a name="C12V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:47</font></a> That
servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he
wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,  <a name="C12V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:48</font></a> but he who didn't know, and did
things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much
is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of
him more will be asked.
<p> <a name="C12V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:49</font></a> &quot;I came to throw fire on
the earth. I wish it were already kindled.  <a name="C12V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:50</font></a> But I have a baptism to be
baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!  <a name="C12V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:51</font></a> Do you think that I have come to
give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.  <a name="C12V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:52</font></a> For from now on, there will be
five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
 <a name="C12V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:53</font></a> They will be divided,
father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and
daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law,
and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:54</font></a> He said to the
multitudes also, &quot;When you see a cloud rising from
the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
 <a name="C12V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:55</font></a> When a south wind blows,
you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.  <a name="C12V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:56</font></a> You hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you
don't interpret this time?  <a name="C12V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:57</font></a> Why don't you judge for
yourselves what is right?  <a name="C12V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:58</font></a> For when you are going with your
adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released
from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you
to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.  <a name="C12V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:59</font></a> I tell you, you will by no means
get out of there, until you have paid the very last <a
href="#N30">penny.</a>&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Now there were some
present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood
Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Jesus answered them, &quot;Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than
all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> I tell you, no, but, unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Or those eighteen, on whom the
tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse
offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> I tell you, no, but, unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> He spoke this parable.
&quot;A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> He said to the vine dresser,
'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree,
and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> He answered, 'Lord, leave it
alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> If it bears fruit, fine; but if
not, after that, you can cut it down.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> He was teaching in
one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Behold, there was a woman who
had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could
in no way straighten herself up.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> When Jesus saw her, he called
her, and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are freed from your
infirmity.&quot;  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> He laid his hands on her, and
immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.
<p> <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> The ruler of the
synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said
to the multitude, &quot;There are six days in which men ought to work.
Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath
day!&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Therefore the Lord
answered him, &quot;You hypocrites! Doesn't each one of
you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him
away to water?  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Ought not
this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen
long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> As he said these
things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude
rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
<p> <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> He said, &quot;What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare
it?  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> It is like a grain
of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and
became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Again he said, &quot;To what
shall I compare the Kingdom of God?  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> It is like yeast, which a woman
took and hid in <a href="#N31">three measures</a> of flour, until it was
all leavened.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> He went on his way
through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
 <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> One said to him,
&quot;Lord, are they few who are saved?&quot;
<p>He said to them,  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> &quot;Strive to
enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in,
and will not be able.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> When once the master of the
house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside,
and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will
answer and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Then you will begin to say, 'We
ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> He will say, 'I tell you, I
don't know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of
iniquity.'  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> There will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all
the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
 <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> They will come from the
east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
 <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Behold, there are some
who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will
be last.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> On that same day,
some Pharisees came, saying to him, &quot;Get out of here, and go away,
for Herod wants to kill you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and
perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
 <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> Nevertheless I must go
on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a
prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.'
<p> <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> &quot;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I
wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood
under her wings, and you refused!  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> Behold, your house is left to
you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is
he who comes in the name of the Lord!'&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N32">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> It happened, when he
went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to
eat bread, that they were watching him.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> Behold, a certain man who had
dropsy was in front of him.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Jesus, answering, spoke to the
lawyers and Pharisees, saying, &quot;Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> But they were silent.
<p>He took him, and healed him, and let him go.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> He answered them, &quot;Which of you, if your <a href="#N33">son</a> or an ox fell
into a well, wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath
day?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> They couldn't answer
him regarding these things.
<p> <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> He spoke a parable to
those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and
said to them,  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> &quot;When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't
sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might
be invited by him,  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> and he
who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this
person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
 <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> But when you are
invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you
comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored
in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> He also said to the
one who had invited him, &quot;When you make a dinner or a
supper, don't call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor
rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you
back.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> But when you make
a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> and you will be blessed, because
they don't have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the
resurrection of the righteous.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> When one of those who
sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him,
&quot;Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> But he said to him,
&quot;A certain man made a great supper, and he invited
many people.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> He sent out
his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for
everything is ready now.'  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> They all as one began to make
excuses.
<p>&quot;The first said to him, 'I have bought a
field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'
<p> <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> &quot;Another said, 'I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me
excused.'
<p> <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> &quot;Another said, 'I have
married a wife, and therefore I can't come.'
<p> <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> &quot;That servant came, and
told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry,
said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the
city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'
<p> <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> &quot;The servant said, 'Lord,
it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
<p> <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> &quot;The lord said to the
servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,
that my house may be filled.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> For I tell you that none of
those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> Now great multitudes
were going with him. He turned and said to them,  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> &quot;If anyone
comes to me, and doesn't hate his own father, mother, wife, children,
brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can't be my
disciple.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> Whoever
doesn't bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.
 <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> For which of you,
desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to
see if he has enough to complete it?  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Or perhaps, when he has laid a
foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
him,  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> saying, 'This man
began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Or what king, as he goes to
encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him
with twenty thousand?  <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> Or
else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks
for conditions of peace.  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> So therefore whoever of you who
doesn't renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.  <a name="C14V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:34</font></a> Salt is good, but if the salt
becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?  <a name="C14V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:35</font></a> It is fit neither for the soil
nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let
him hear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Now all the tax
collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> The Pharisees and the scribes
murmured, saying, &quot;This man welcomes sinners, and eats with
them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> He told them this
parable.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> &quot;Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost
one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go
after the one that was lost, until he found it?  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> When he has found it, he carries
it on his shoulders, rejoicing.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> When he comes home, he calls
together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me,
for I have found my sheep which was lost!'  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> I tell you that even so there
will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> Or what woman, if she had ten <a
href="#N34">drachma</a> coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn't
light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> When she has found it,
she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me,
for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> Even so, I tell you, there is
joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
repenting.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> He said, &quot;A certain man had two sons.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> The younger of them said to his
father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his
livelihood between them.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> Not many days after, the younger
son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There
he wasted his property with riotous living.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> When he had spent all of it,
there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
 <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> He went and joined
himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his
fields to feed pigs.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> He
wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave
him any.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> But when he
came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have
bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> I will get up and go to my
father, and will tell him, &quot;Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
in your sight.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> I am no
more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired
servants.&quot;'
<p> <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> &quot;He arose, and came to his
father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved
with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> The son said to him, 'Father, I
have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be
called your son.'
<p> <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> &quot;But the father said to his
servants, 'Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> Bring the fattened calf, kill
it, and let us eat, and celebrate;  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> for this, my son, was dead, and
is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.
<p> <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> &quot;Now his elder son was in
the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
 <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> He called one of the
servants to him, and asked what was going on.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> He said to him, 'Your brother
has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has
received him back safe and healthy.'  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> But he was angry, and would not
go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> But he answered his father,
'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a
commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate
with my friends.  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> But
when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes,
you killed the fattened calf for him.'
<p> <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> &quot;He said to him, 'Son, you
are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> But it was appropriate to
celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive
again. He was lost, and is found.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> He also said to his
disciples, &quot;There was a certain rich man who had a
manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his
possessions.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> He called
him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an
accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
<p> <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> &quot;The manager said within
himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the
management position from me? I don't have strength to dig. I am ashamed to
beg.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> I know what I will
do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into
their houses.'  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> Calling
each one of his lord's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do
you owe to my lord?'  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> He
said, 'A <a href="#N35">hundred batos</a> of oil.' He said to him, 'Take
your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Then said he to another, 'How
much do you owe?' He said, 'A <a href="#N36">hundred cors</a> of wheat.'
He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
<p> <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> &quot;His lord commended the
dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this
world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
 <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> I tell you, make for
yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail,
they may receive you into the eternal tents.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> He who is faithful in a very
little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is
also dishonest in much.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> If therefore you have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches?  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> If you have not
been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is
your own?  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> No servant can
serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or
else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren't able to serve
God and <a href="#N37">mammon</a>.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> The Pharisees, who
were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at
him.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of
men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an
abomination in the sight of God.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> The law and the prophets were
until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is
preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> But it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
 <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> Everyone who divorces
his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is
divorced from a husband commits adultery.
<p> <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> &quot;Now there was a certain
rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury
every day.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> A certain
beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and
licked his sores.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> It
happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels
to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> In <a href="#N38">Hades</a>, he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus
at his bosom.  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> He cried
and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may
dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in
anguish in this flame.'
<p> <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> &quot;But Abraham said, 'Son,
remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and
Lazarus, in like manner, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you
are in anguish.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> Besides
all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who
want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over
from there to us.'
<p> <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> &quot;He said, 'I ask you
therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> for I have five brothers, that
he may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of
torment.'
<p> <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> &quot;But Abraham said to him,
'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'
<p> <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> &quot;He said, 'No, father
Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
<p> <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> &quot;He said to him, 'If they
don't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if
one rises from the dead.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> He said to the
disciples, &quot;It is impossible that no occasions of
stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> It would be better for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea,
rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
 <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> Be careful. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> If he sins against you seven
times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall
forgive him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> The apostles said to
the Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> The Lord said, &quot;If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would
tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it
would obey you.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> But who
is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will
say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at
the table,'  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> and will not
rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve
me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Does he thank that servant
because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> Even so you also, when you have
done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy
servants. We have done our duty.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> It happened as he was
on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria
and Galilee.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> As he
entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood
at a distance.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> They
lifted up their voices, saying, &quot;Jesus, Master, have mercy on
us!&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> When he saw them, he
said to them, &quot;Go and show yourselves to the
priests.&quot; It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
 <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> One of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> He fell on his face at Jesus'
feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> Were there none found who
returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?&quot;  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> Then he said to him, &quot;Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> Being asked by the
Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, &quot;The Kingdom of God doesn't come with observation;  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> neither will they say, 'Look,
here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> He said to the
disciples, &quot;The days will come, when you will desire
to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.  <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> They will tell you, 'Look,
here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> for as the lightning, when it
flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under
the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> But first, he must suffer many
things and be rejected by this generation.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> As it happened in the days of
Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> They ate, they drank, they
married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  <a name="C17V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:28</font></a> Likewise, even as it happened in
the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they built;  <a name="C17V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:29</font></a> but
in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from
the sky, and destroyed them all.  <a name="C17V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:30</font></a> It will be the same way in the
day that the Son of Man is revealed.  <a name="C17V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:31</font></a> In that day, he who will be on
the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.  <a name="C17V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:32</font></a> Remember Lot's wife!  <a name="C17V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:33</font></a> Whoever seeks to save his life
loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.  <a name="C17V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:34</font></a> I tell you, in that night there
will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will
be left.  <a name="C17V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:35</font></a> There will be
two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be
left.&quot;  <a name="C17V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:36</font></a> <font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N39">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C17V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:37</font></a> They, answering,
asked him, &quot;Where, Lord?&quot;
<p>He said to them, &quot;Where the body is, there will
the vultures also be gathered together.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> He also spoke a
parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> saying, &quot;There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God,
and didn't respect man.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> A
widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from
my adversary!'  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> He
wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither
fear God, nor respect man,  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> yet because this widow bothers
me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual
coming.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> The Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> Won't God avenge his chosen ones,
who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience
with them?  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> I tell you
that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,
will he find faith on the earth?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> He spoke also this
parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness,
and who despised all others.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> &quot;Two men
went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a
tax collector.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> The
Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I
am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or
even like this tax collector.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> I fast twice a week. I give
tithes of all that I get.'  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> But the tax collector, standing
far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be
exalted.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> They were also
bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the
disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> Jesus summoned them, saying,
&quot;Allow the little children to come to me, and don't
hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Most certainly, I tell you,
whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in
no way enter into it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> A certain ruler asked
him, saying, &quot;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal
life?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Jesus asked him,
&quot;Why do you call me good? No one is good, except
one--God.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> You know the
commandments: 'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,'
'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your
mother.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N40">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> He said, &quot;I have
observed all these things from my youth up.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> When Jesus heard
these things, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one
thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will
have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> But when he heard
these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
<p> <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> Jesus, seeing that he
became very sad, said, &quot;How hard it is for those who
have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> For it is easier for a camel to
enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> Those who heard it
said, &quot;Then who can be saved?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> But he said, &quot;The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> Peter said,
&quot;Look, we have left everything, and followed you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has
left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom
of God's sake,  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> who will
not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come,
eternal life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> He took the twelve
aside, and said to them, &quot;Behold, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets
concerning the Son of Man will be completed.  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> For he will be delivered up to
the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.  <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> They will scourge and kill him.
On the third day, he will rise again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:34</font></a> They understood none
of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't
understand the things that were said.  <a name="C18V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:35</font></a> It happened, as he came near
Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.  <a name="C18V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:36</font></a> Hearing a multitude going by, he
asked what this meant.  <a name="C18V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:37</font></a> They told him that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by.  <a name="C18V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:38</font></a> He cried out, &quot;Jesus, you
son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;  <a name="C18V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:39</font></a> Those who led the way rebuked
him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, &quot;You son
of David, have mercy on me!&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:40</font></a> Standing still, Jesus
commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
 <a name="C18V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:41</font></a> &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Lord, that I may see again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:42</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Receive your sight. Your faith has healed
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:43</font></a> Immediately he
received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when
they saw it, praised God.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> He entered and was
passing through Jericho.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> There was a man named Zacchaeus.
He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> He was trying to see who Jesus
was, and couldn't because of the crowd, because he was short.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> He ran on ahead, and climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> When Jesus came to the place, he
looked up and saw him, and said to him, &quot;Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.&quot;
 <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> He hurried, came down,
and received him joyfully.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> When they saw it, they all
murmured, saying, &quot;He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a
sinner.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> Zacchaeus stood and
said to the Lord, &quot;Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor.
If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as
much.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of
Abraham.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> For the Son of
Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> As they heard these
things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and
they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
 <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> He said therefore, &quot;A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom, and to return.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> He called ten servants of his,
and gave them <a href="#N41">ten mina coins,</a> and told them, 'Conduct
business until I come.'  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> But his citizens hated him, and
sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'
<p> <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> &quot;It happened when he had
come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these
servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he
might know what they had gained by conducting business.  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> The first came before him,
saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'
<p> <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> &quot;He said to him, 'Well
done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little,
you shall have authority over ten cities.'
<p> <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> &quot;The second came, saying,
'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'
<p> <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> &quot;So he said to him, 'And
you are to be over five cities.'  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> Another came, saying, 'Lord,
behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> for I feared you, because you
are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap
that which you didn't sow.'
<p> <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> &quot;He said to him, 'Out of
your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an
exacting man, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that
which I didn't sow.  <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> Then
why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might
have earned interest on it?'  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> He said to those who stood by,
'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'
<p> <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> &quot;They said to him, 'Lord,
he has ten minas!'  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> 'For
I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who
doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> But bring those enemies of mine
who didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before
me.'&quot;  <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> Having
said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> It happened, when he
drew near to <a href="#N42">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the mountain
that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> saying, &quot;Go
your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you
will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring
it.  <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> If anyone asks you,
'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> Those who were sent
went away, and found things just as he had told them.  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> As they were untying the colt,
its owners said to them, &quot;Why are you untying the colt?&quot;  <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> They said, &quot;The Lord needs
it.&quot;  <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> They brought
it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.
 <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> As he went, they spread
their cloaks in the way.  <a name="C19V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:37</font></a> As he was now getting near, at
the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
which they had seen,  <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> saying, &quot;Blessed is the
King who comes in the name of the Lord!<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N43">*</a></sup></font> Peace in heaven, and glory
in the highest!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:39</font></a> Some of the Pharisees
from the multitude said to him, &quot;Teacher, rebuke your disciples!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:40</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;I tell you that if these were silent, the stones
would cry out.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:41</font></a> When he drew near, he
saw the city and wept over it,  <a name="C19V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:42</font></a> saying, &quot;If
you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But
now, they are hidden from your eyes.  <a name="C19V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:43</font></a> For the days will come on you,
when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem
you in on every side,  <a name="C19V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:44</font></a> and will dash you and your
children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on
another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:45</font></a> He entered into the
temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,  <a name="C19V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:46</font></a> saying to them, &quot;It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font> but you
have made it a 'den of robbers'!&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C19V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:47</font></a> He was teaching daily
in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men
among the people sought to destroy him.  <a name="C19V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:48</font></a> They couldn't find what they
might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> It happened on one of
those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the
Good News, that the <font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N46">*</a></sup></font>priests and scribes came to him with the
elders.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> They asked him,
&quot;Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving
you this authority?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;I also will ask you one question. Tell me:  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> the baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or from men?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> They reasoned with
themselves, saying, &quot;If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why
didn't you believe him?'  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> But if we say, 'From men,' all
the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
prophet.&quot;  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> They
answered that they didn't know where it was from.
<p> <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these
things.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> He began to tell the
people this parable. &quot;A <font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>man planted a vineyard, and
rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long
time.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> At the proper
season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit
of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
 <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> He sent yet another
servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him
away empty.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> He sent yet
a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> The lord of the vineyard said,
'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,
they will respect him.'
<p> <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> &quot;But when the farmers saw
him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come,
let's kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> They threw him out of the
vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do
to them?  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> He will come
and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to
others.&quot;
<p>When they heard it, they said, &quot;May it never be!&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> But he looked at
them, and said, &quot;Then what is this that is written,
<dl>
<dt>'The stone which the builders rejected,
<dd>the same was made the chief cornerstone?'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N48">*</a></sup></font>
<dt> <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Everyone who falls
on that stone will be broken to pieces,
<dd>but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> The chief priests and
the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the
people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> They watched him, and sent out
spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in
something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of
the governor.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> They asked
him, &quot;Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and
aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> Is it lawful for us to pay taxes
to Caesar, or not?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> But he perceived
their craftiness, and said to them, &quot;Why do you test
me?  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> Show me a denarius.
Whose image and inscription are on it?&quot;
<p>They answered, &quot;Caesar's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and to God the things that are God's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> They weren't able to
trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and
were silent.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> Some of the
Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
 <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> They asked him,
&quot;Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a
wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up
children for his brother.  <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> There were therefore seven
brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.  <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> The second took her as wife, and
he died childless.  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> The
third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
 <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> Afterward the woman also
died.  <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> Therefore in the
resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a
wife.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;The children of this age marry, and are given in
marriage.  <a name="C20V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:35</font></a> But those who
are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.  <a name="C20V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:36</font></a> For they can't die any more, for
they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the
resurrection.  <a name="C20V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:37</font></a> But that
the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the
Lord 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N49">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C20V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:38</font></a> Now he is not the God of the
dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:39</font></a> Some of the scribes
answered, &quot;Teacher, you speak well.&quot;  <a name="C20V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:40</font></a> They didn't dare to ask him any
more questions.
<p> <a name="C20V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:41</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?
 <a name="C20V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:42</font></a> David himself says in
the book of Psalms,
<dl>
<dt>'The Lord said to my Lord,
<dd>&quot;Sit at my right hand,
<dd> <a name="C20V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:43</font></a> until I make your
enemies the footstool of your feet.&quot;'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N50">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C20V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:44</font></a> &quot;David therefore calls him
Lord, so how is he his son?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:45</font></a> In the hearing of all
the people, he said to his disciples,  <a name="C20V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:46</font></a> &quot;Beware of
the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the
marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at
feasts;  <a name="C20V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:47</font></a> who devour
widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive
greater condemnation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> He looked up, and saw
the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> He saw a certain poor widow
casting in <a href="#N51">two small brass coins.</a>  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> He said, &quot;Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of
them,  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> for all these put
in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in
all that she had to live on.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> As some were talking
about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts,
he said,  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> &quot;As for these things which you see, the days will come, in
which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be
thrown down.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> They asked him,
&quot;Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these
things are about to happen?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> He said, &quot;Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many will
come in my name, saying, '<a href="#N52">I am he</a>,' and, 'The time is
at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> When you hear of wars and
disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but
the end won't come immediately.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> Then he said to them,
&quot;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> There will be
great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be
terrors and great signs from heaven.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> But before all these things,
they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up
to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name's sake.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> It will
turn out as a testimony for you.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> Settle it therefore in your
hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> for I will give you a mouth and
wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to
contradict.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> You will be
handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will
cause some of you to be put to death.  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> You will be hated by all men for
my name's sake.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> And not
a hair of your head will perish.
<p> <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> &quot;By your endurance you will
win your lives.
<p> <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> &quot;But when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Then let those who are in Judea
flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let
those who are in the country not enter therein.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> For these are days of vengeance,
that all things which are written may be fulfilled.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great
distress in the land, and wrath to this people.  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> They will fall by the edge of
the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be
trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> There will be
signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in
perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> men fainting for fear, and for
expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of
the heavens will be shaken.  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> Then they will see the Son of
Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> But when these things begin to
happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is
near.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> He told them a
parable. &quot;See the fig tree, and all the trees.
 <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> When they are already
budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already
near.  <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> Even so you also,
when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
 <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> Most certainly I tell
you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.
 <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> Heaven and earth will
pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
<p> <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> &quot;So be careful, or your
hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this
life, and that day will come on you suddenly.  <a name="C21V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:35</font></a> For it will come like a snare on
all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.  <a name="C21V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:36</font></a> Therefore be watchful all the
time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things
that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:37</font></a> Every day Jesus was
teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the
night on the mountain that is called Olivet.  <a name="C21V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:38</font></a> All the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple to hear him.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> Now the feast of
unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> The chief priests and the scribes
sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
 <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> Satan entered into Judas,
who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> He went away, and talked with the
chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> They were glad, and agreed to
give him money.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> He
consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence
of the multitude.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> The day
of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
 <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> He sent Peter and John,
saying, &quot;Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we
may eat.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Where do you want us to prepare?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man
carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which
he enters.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> Tell the
master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, &quot;Where is the guest
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&quot;'  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> He will show you a large,
furnished upper room. Make preparations there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> They went, found
things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> When the hour had come, he sat
down with the twelve apostles.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> He said to them, &quot;I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you
before I suffer,  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> for I
tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in
the Kingdom of God.&quot;  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> He received a cup, and when he
had given thanks, he said, &quot;Take this, and share it
among yourselves,  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> for I
tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until
the Kingdom of God comes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> He took bread, and
when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, &quot;This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory
of me.&quot;  <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> Likewise, he took the cup after
supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my
blood, which is poured out for you.  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> But behold, the hand of him who
betrays me is with me on the table.  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> The Son of Man indeed goes, as
it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is
betrayed!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> They began to
question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
 <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> There arose also a
contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
 <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> He said to them, &quot;The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who
have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> But not so with you. But one who
is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is
governing, as one who serves.  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> For who is greater, one who sits
at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it he who sits at the table? But I
am in the midst of you as one who serves.  <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> But you are those who have
continued with me in my trials.  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> I confer on you a kingdom, even
as my Father conferred on me,  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> that you may eat and drink at my
table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> The Lord said, &quot;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he
might sift you as wheat,  <a name="C22V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:32</font></a> but I prayed for you, that your
faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your
<a href="#N53">brothers</a>.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:33</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:34</font></a> He said, &quot;I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today
until you deny that you know me three times.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:35</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and
shoes, did you lack anything?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Nothing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:36</font></a> Then he said to them,
&quot;But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and
likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a
sword.  <a name="C22V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:37</font></a> For I tell you
that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted
with the lawless.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N54">*</a></sup></font> For that which concerns me has an
end.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:38</font></a> They said,
&quot;Lord, behold, here are two swords.&quot;
<p>He said to them, &quot;That is enough.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:39</font></a> He came out, and
went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also
followed him.  <a name="C22V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:40</font></a> When he
was at the place, he said to them, &quot;Pray that you
don't enter into temptation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:41</font></a> He was withdrawn from
them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,  <a name="C22V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:42</font></a> saying, &quot;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:43</font></a> An angel from heaven
appeared to him, strengthening him.  <a name="C22V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:44</font></a> Being in agony he prayed more
earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the
ground.
<p> <a name="C22V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:45</font></a> When he rose up from
his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of
grief,  <a name="C22V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:46</font></a> and said to them,
&quot;Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not
enter into temptation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:47</font></a> While he was still
speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the
twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.  <a name="C22V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:48</font></a> But Jesus said to him, &quot;Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a
kiss?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:49</font></a> When those who were
around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, &quot;Lord,
shall we strike with the sword?&quot;  <a name="C22V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:50</font></a> A certain one of them struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
<p> <a name="C22V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:51</font></a> But Jesus answered,
&quot;Let me at least do this&quot;--and he touched
his ear, and healed him.  <a name="C22V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:52</font></a> Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, &quot;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and
clubs?  <a name="C22V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:53</font></a> When I was with
you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch out your hands against me. But
this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:54</font></a> They seized him, and
led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter
followed from a distance.  <a name="C22V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:55</font></a> When they had kindled a fire in
the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among
them.  <a name="C22V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:56</font></a> A certain servant
girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said,
&quot;This man also was with him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:57</font></a> He denied Jesus,
saying, &quot;Woman, I don't know him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:58</font></a> After a little while
someone else saw him, and said, &quot;You also are one of them!&quot;
<p>But Peter answered, &quot;Man, I am not!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:59</font></a> After about one hour
passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, &quot;Truly this man also
was with him, for he is a Galilean!&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:60</font></a> But Peter said,
&quot;Man, I don't know what you are talking about!&quot; Immediately,
while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.  <a name="C22V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:61</font></a> The Lord turned, and looked at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, &quot;Before the rooster crows you will deny me three
times.&quot;  <a name="C22V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:62</font></a> He
went out, and wept bitterly.
<p> <a name="C22V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:63</font></a> The men who held
Jesus mocked him and beat him.  <a name="C22V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:64</font></a> Having blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face and asked him, &quot;Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you?&quot;  <a name="C22V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:65</font></a> They
spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
<p> <a name="C22V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:66</font></a> As soon as it was
day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both
chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council,
saying,  <a name="C22V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:67</font></a> &quot;If you are
the Christ, tell us.&quot;
<p>But he said to them, &quot;If I tell you, you won't
believe,  <a name="C22V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:68</font></a> and if I ask,
you will in no way answer me or let me go.  <a name="C22V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:69</font></a> From now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:70</font></a> They all said,
&quot;Are you then the Son of God?&quot;
<p>He said to them, &quot;You say it, because I
am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:71</font></a> They said, &quot;Why
do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own
mouth!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> The whole company of
them rose up and brought him before Pilate.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> They began to accuse him, saying,
&quot;We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> Pilate asked him,
&quot;Are you the King of the Jews?&quot;
<p>He answered him, &quot;So you say.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> Pilate said to the
chief priests and the multitudes, &quot;I find no basis for a charge
against this man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> But they insisted,
saying, &quot;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee even to this place.&quot;  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> But when Pilate heard Galilee
mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> When he found out that he was in
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
during those days.
<p> <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> Now when Herod saw
Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long
time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some
miracle done by him.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> The chief priests and the
scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> Herod with his soldiers
humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they
sent him back to Pilate.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> Herod and Pilate became friends
with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each
other.
<p> <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> Pilate called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> and said to them, &quot;You
brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have
examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man
concerning those things of which you accuse him.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> I will therefore chastise him
and release him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> Now he had to release
one prisoner to them at the feast.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> But they all cried out together,
saying, &quot;Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!&quot;-- <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> one who was thrown into prison
for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
<p> <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> Then Pilate spoke to
them again, wanting to release Jesus,  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> but they shouted, saying,
&quot;Crucify! Crucify him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> He said to them the
third time, &quot;Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no
capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.&quot;
 <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> But they were urgent
with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the
voices of the chief priests prevailed.  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> Pilate decreed that what they
asked for should be done.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> He released him who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but
he delivered Jesus up to their will.
<p> <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> When they led him
away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid
on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.  <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> A great multitude of the people
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.  <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> But Jesus, turning to them,
said, &quot;Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but
weep for yourselves and for your children.  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> For behold, the days are coming
in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> Then they will begin to tell the
mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N55">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> For if they do these things in
the green tree, what will be done in the dry?&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> There were also
others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.  <a name="C23V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:33</font></a> When they came to the place that
is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on
the right and the other on the left.
<p> <a name="C23V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:34</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are
doing.&quot;
<p>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.  <a name="C23V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:35</font></a> The people stood watching. The
rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, &quot;He saved others. Let
him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:36</font></a> The soldiers also
mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,  <a name="C23V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:37</font></a> and saying, &quot;If you are the
King of the Jews, save yourself!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:38</font></a> An inscription was
also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: &quot;THIS
IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:39</font></a> One of the criminals
who was hanged insulted him, saying, &quot;If you are the Christ, save
yourself and us!&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:40</font></a> But the other
answered, and rebuking him said, &quot;Don't you even fear God, seeing you
are under the same condemnation?  <a name="C23V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:41</font></a> And we indeed justly, for we
receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing
wrong.&quot;  <a name="C23V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:42</font></a> He said to
Jesus, &quot;Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:43</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in
Paradise.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:44</font></a> It was now <a
href="#N56">about the sixth hour</a>, and darkness came over the whole
land until <a href="#N57">the ninth hour.</a>  <a name="C23V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:45</font></a> The sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two.  <a name="C23V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:46</font></a> Jesus, crying with a loud voice,
said, &quot;Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!&quot; Having said this, he breathed his last.
<p> <a name="C23V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:47</font></a> When the centurion
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, &quot;Certainly this was a
righteous man.&quot;  <a name="C23V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:48</font></a> All
the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts.  <a name="C23V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:49</font></a> All his acquaintances, and the
women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
<p> <a name="C23V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:50</font></a> Behold, a man named
Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man  <a name="C23V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:51</font></a> (he had not consented to their
counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also
waiting for the Kingdom of God:  <a name="C23V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:52</font></a> this man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus' body.  <a name="C23V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:53</font></a> He took it down, and wrapped it
in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no
one had ever been laid.  <a name="C23V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:54</font></a> It was the day of the
Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.  <a name="C23V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:55</font></a> The women, who had come with him
out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was
laid.  <a name="C23V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:56</font></a> They returned, and
prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the
commandment.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> But on the first day
of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb,
bringing the spices which they had prepared.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> They found the stone rolled away
from the tomb.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> They
entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> It happened, while they were
greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling
clothing.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> Becoming
terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
<p>They said to them, &quot;Why do you seek the living among the dead?
 <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> He isn't here, but is
risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> saying that the Son of Man must
be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> They remembered his
words,  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> returned from the
tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
 <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> Now they were Mary
Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them
told these things to the apostles.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> These words seemed to them to be
nonsense, and they didn't believe them.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> But Peter got up and ran to the
tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by
themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
<p> <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> Behold, two of them
were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was <a
href="#N58">sixty stadia</a> from Jerusalem.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> They talked with each other
about all of these things which had happened.  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> It happened, while they talked
and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
 <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> But their eyes were kept
from recognizing him.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> He
said to them, &quot;What are you talking about as you
walk, and are sad?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> One of them, named
Cleopas, answered him, &quot;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who
doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;What things?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who
was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
 <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> and how the chief
priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and
crucified him.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> But we
were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all
this, it is now the third day since these things happened.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> Also, certain women of our
company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> and when they didn't find his
body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who
said that he was alive.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> Some of us went to the tomb, and
found it just like the women had said, but they didn't see him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all
that the prophets have spoken!  <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> Didn't the Christ have to suffer
these things and to enter into his glory?&quot;  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> Beginning from Moses and from
all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself.  <a name="C24V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:28</font></a> They
drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he
would go further.
<p> <a name="C24V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:29</font></a> They urged him,
saying, &quot;Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is
almost over.&quot;
<p>He went in to stay with them.  <a name="C24V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:30</font></a> It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them.  <a name="C24V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:31</font></a> Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.  <a name="C24V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:32</font></a> They said one to another,
&quot;Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the
way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?&quot;  <a name="C24V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:33</font></a> They rose up that very hour,
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those
who were with them,  <a name="C24V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:34</font></a> saying, &quot;The Lord is risen
indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&quot;  <a name="C24V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:35</font></a> They related the things that
happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking
of the bread.
<p> <a name="C24V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:36</font></a> As they said these
things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, &quot;Peace be to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:37</font></a> But they were
terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
<p> <a name="C24V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:38</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your
hearts?  <a name="C24V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:39</font></a> See my hands and
my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have
flesh and bones, as you see that I have.&quot;  <a name="C24V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:40</font></a> When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and his feet.  <a name="C24V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:41</font></a> While they still didn't believe
for joy, and wondered, he said to them, &quot;Do you have
anything here to eat?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:42</font></a> They gave him a piece
of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.  <a name="C24V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:43</font></a> He took them, and ate in front
of them.  <a name="C24V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:44</font></a> He said to
them, &quot;This is what I told you, while I was still
with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the
prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:45</font></a> Then he opened their
minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.  <a name="C24V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:46</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the
Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,  <a name="C24V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:47</font></a> and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
beginning at Jerusalem.  <a name="C24V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:48</font></a> You are witnesses of these
things.  <a name="C24V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:49</font></a> Behold, I send
forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem
until you are clothed with power from on high.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:50</font></a> He led them out as
far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.  <a name="C24V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:51</font></a> It happened, while he blessed
them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.  <a name="C24V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:52</font></a> They worshiped him, and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy,  <a name="C24V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:53</font></a> and were continually in the
temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web4210h.htm or web4210h.zip<br>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
