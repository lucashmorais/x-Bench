<h1>
Nahum
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> An oracle about Nineveh.
The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Yahweh is a jealous God and
avenges. Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on
his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Yahweh is slow to anger, and great
in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his
way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his
feet.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> He rebukes the sea,
and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and
Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> The mountains quake before him,
and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the
world, and all who dwell in it.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Who can stand before his
indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is
poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Yahweh is good, a stronghold in
the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But with an overflowing flood, he
will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into
darkness.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> What do you plot
against Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won't rise up the
second time.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> For
entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed
utterly like dry stubble.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> There is one gone forth out of
you, who devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: &quot;Though
they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut
down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict
you no more.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Now will I
break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.&quot;
 <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Yahweh has commanded
concerning you: &quot;No more descendants will bear your name. Out of the
house of your gods, will I cut off the engraved image and the molten
image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Behold, on the
mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep
your feasts, Judah! Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more
pass through you. He is utterly cut off.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> He who dashes in pieces
has come up against you. Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your
waist! Fortify your power mightily!  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> For Yahweh restores the excellency
of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed
them, and ruined their vine branches.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> The shield of his mighty men is
made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in
the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> The chariots rage in the streets.
They rush back and forth in the broad ways. Their appearance is like
torches. They run like the lightnings.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> He summons his picked troops. They
stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is
put in place.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The gates of
the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> It is decreed: she is uncovered,
she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves,
beating on their breasts.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> But Nineveh has been from of old
like a pool of water, yet they flee away. &quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; they
cry, but no one looks back.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Take the spoil of silver. Take the
spoil of gold, for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly
furniture.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> She is empty,
void, and waste. The heart melts, the knees knock together, their bodies
and faces have grown pale.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Where is the den of the lions,
and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness
walked, the lion's cubs, and no one made them afraid?  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> The lion tore in pieces enough
for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with
the kill, and his dens with prey.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> &quot;Behold, I am against
you,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and I will burn her chariots in
the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; and I will cut off
your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer
be heard.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Woe to the bloody city!
It is all full of lies and robbery. The prey doesn't depart.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> The noise of the whip, the noise
of the rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots,  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> the horseman mounting, and the
flashing sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a
great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on
their bodies,  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> because of
the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress
of witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and families
through her witchcraft.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> &quot;Behold, I am against
you,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and I will lift your skirts over
your face. I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your
shame.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> I will throw
abominable filth on you, and make you vile, and will set you a spectacle.
 <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> It will happen that all
those who look at you will flee from you, and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste!
Who will mourn for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Are you better than <a
href="#N1">No-Amon,</a> who was situated among the rivers, who had the
waters around her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Cush and Egypt were her
boundless strength. Put and Libya were her helpers.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Yet was she carried away. She
went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the
head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all
her great men were bound in chains.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> You also will be drunken. You
will be hidden. You also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
 <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> All your fortresses will
be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall
into the mouth of the eater.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Behold, your troops in your midst
are women. The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies. The
fire has devoured your bars.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Draw water for the siege.
Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make
the brick kiln strong.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> There the fire will devour you.
The sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper.
Multiply like grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> You have increased your merchants
more than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips, and flees away.
 <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Your guards are like the
locusts, and your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on
the walls on a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and
their place is not known where they are.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Your shepherds slumber, king of
Assyria. Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains,
and there is no one to gather them.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> There is no healing your wound,
for your injury is fatal. All who hear the report of you clap their hands
over you; for who hasn't felt your endless cruelty?

<p>This file should be named web3410h.htm or web3410h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web3411h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web3410ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
