<h1>
Exodus
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Now these are the names of
the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came
with Jacob):  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Reuben,
Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
 <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and
Asher.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> All the souls who
came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt
already.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Joseph died, as
did all his brothers, and all that generation.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> The children of Israel were
fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly
mighty; and the land was filled with them.
<p> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Now there arose a new
king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> He said to his people,
&quot;Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier
than we.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Come, let us
deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war
breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against
us, and escape out of the land.&quot;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Therefore they set taskmasters
over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities
for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> But the more they afflicted them,
the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved
because of the children of Israel.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> The Egyptians ruthlessly made the
children of Israel serve,  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> and they made their lives bitter
with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in
the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
<p> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> The king of Egypt
spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah,
and the name of the other Puah,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> and he said, &quot;When you
perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the
birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a
daughter, then she shall live.&quot;  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> But the midwives feared God, and
didn't do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys
alive.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> The king of Egypt
called for the midwives, and said to them, &quot;Why have you done this
thing, and have saved the boys alive?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> The midwives said to
Pharaoh, &quot;Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women;
for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to
them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> God dealt well with
the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> It happened, because the midwives
feared God, that he gave them families.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Pharaoh commanded all his people,
saying, &quot;You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and
every daughter you shall save alive.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> A man of the house of
Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The woman conceived, and bore a
son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
 <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> When she could no longer
hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and
with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the
river's bank.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> His sister
stood far off, to see what would be done to him.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Pharaoh's daughter came down to
bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the
basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> She opened it, and saw the child,
and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said,
&quot;This is one of the Hebrews' children.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Then his sister said to
Pharaoh's daughter, &quot;Should I go and call a nurse for you from the
Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Pharaoh's daughter said
to her, &quot;Go.&quot;
<p>The maiden went and called the child's mother.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Pharaoh's daughter said to her,
&quot;Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your
wages.&quot;
<p>The woman took the child, and nursed it.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> The child grew, and she brought
him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him <a
href="#N1">Moses,</a> and said, &quot;Because I drew him out of the
water.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> It happened in those
days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and
looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his
brothers.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> He looked this
way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the
Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> He went out the second
day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He
said to him who did the wrong, &quot;Why do you strike your fellow?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> He said, &quot;Who
made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you
killed the Egyptian?&quot;
<p>Moses was afraid, and said, &quot;Surely this thing is known.&quot;
 <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Now when Pharaoh heard
this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of
Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
<p> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Now the priest of
Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the
troughs to water their father's flock.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> The shepherds came and drove them
away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> When they came to Reuel, their
father, he said, &quot;How is it that you have returned so early
today?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> They said, &quot;An
Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he
drew water for us, and watered the flock.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> He said to his
daughters, &quot;Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call
him, that he may eat bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Moses was content to
dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> She bore a son, and he named him
<a href="#N2">Gershom,</a> for he said, &quot;I have lived as a foreigner
in a foreign land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> It happened in the
course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children
of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry
came up to God because of the bondage.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> God heard their groaning, and God
remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> God saw the children of Israel,
and God was concerned about them.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now Moses was keeping
the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led
the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to
Horeb.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked,
and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
 <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Moses said, &quot;I will
turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> When Yahweh saw that he
turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and
said, &quot;Moses! Moses!&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> He said, &quot;Don't
come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are
standing on is holy ground.&quot;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Moreover he said, &quot;I am the
God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.&quot;
<p>Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;I
have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have
heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> I have come down to
deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey;
to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite,
the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Now, behold, the cry of the
children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression
with which the Egyptians oppress them.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Come now therefore, and I will
send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people, the children of
Israel, out of Egypt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Moses said to God,
&quot;Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth
the children of Israel out of Egypt?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> He said,
&quot;Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I
have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you
shall serve God on this mountain.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Moses said to God,
&quot;Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The
God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his
name?' What should I tell them?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> God said to Moses,
&quot;I AM WHO I AM,&quot; and he said, &quot;You shall tell the children
of Israel this: 'I AM has sent me to you.'&quot;  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> God said moreover to Moses,
&quot;You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has
sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all
generations.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Go, and
gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, 'Yahweh, the God of
your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to
me, saying, &quot;I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done
to you in Egypt;  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> and I
have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land
of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and
the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.&quot;'  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> They will listen to your voice,
and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt,
and you shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.
Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may
sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> I know that the king of Egypt
won't give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> I will put forth my hand and
strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after
that he will let you go.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> I will give this people favor in
the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall
not go empty-handed.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> But
every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house,
jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on
your sons, and on your daughters. You shall despoil the Egyptians.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Moses answered,
&quot;But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for
they will say, 'Yahweh has not appeared to you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Yahweh said to him,
&quot;What is that in your hand?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;A rod.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> He said, &quot;Throw it
on the ground.&quot;
<p>He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away
from it.
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail.&quot;
<p>He put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his
hand.
<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> &quot;That they may
believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.&quot;  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Yahweh said furthermore to him,
&quot;Now put your hand inside your cloak.&quot;
<p>He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his
hand was leprous, as white as snow.
<p> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> He said, &quot;Put your
hand inside your cloak again.&quot;
<p>He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his
cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> &quot;It will happen,
if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first
sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> It will happen, if they will not
believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall
take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water
which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Moses said to Yahweh,
&quot;Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have
spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow
tongue.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Yahweh said to him,
&quot;Who made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or
blind? Isn't it I, Yahweh?  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Now therefore go, and I will be
with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> He said, &quot;Oh,
Lord, please send someone else.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> The anger of Yahweh
was kindled against Moses, and he said, &quot;What about Aaron, your
brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes
forth to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> You shall speak to him, and put
the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and
will teach you what you shall do.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> He will be your spokesman to the
people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will
be to him as God.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> You
shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Moses went and
returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, &quot;Please let me
go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are
still alive.&quot;
<p>Jethro said to Moses, &quot;Go in peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses
in Midian, &quot;Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your
life are dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Moses took his wife
and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of
Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;When
you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders
which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not
let the people go.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> You
shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my son, my firstborn,
 <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> and I have said to you,
&quot;Let my son go, that he may serve me;&quot; and you have refused to
let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> It happened on the way
at a lodging place, that Yahweh met him and wanted to kill him.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> Then Zipporah took a flint, and
cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said,
&quot;Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> So he let him alone.
Then she said, &quot;You are a bridegroom of blood,&quot; because of the
circumcision.
<p> <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> Yahweh said to Aaron,
&quot;Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&quot;
<p>He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> Moses told Aaron all the words of
Yahweh with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had
instructed him.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> Moses and
Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
 <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> Aaron spoke all the words
which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the
people.  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> The people
believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of
Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads
and worshiped.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Afterward Moses and
Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, &quot;This is what Yahweh, the God of
Israel, says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the
wilderness.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Pharaoh said, &quot;Who
is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't
know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> They said, &quot;The
God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey
into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us
with pestilence, or with the sword.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> The king of Egypt said
to them, &quot;Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their
work? Get back to your burdens!&quot;  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Pharaoh said, &quot;Behold, the
people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their
burdens.&quot;  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> The same
day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers,
saying,  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> &quot;You shall no
longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and
gather straw for themselves.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> The number of the bricks, which
they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything
of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and
sacrifice to our God.'  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Let
heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don't
let them pay any attention to lying words.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> The taskmasters of the
people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying,
This is what Pharaoh says: &quot;I will not give you straw.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Go yourselves, get straw where
you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.&quot;
 <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> So the people were
scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for
straw.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> The taskmasters
were urgent saying, &quot;Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was
straw!&quot;  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> The officers
of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them,
were beaten, and demanded, &quot;Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both
yesterday and today, in making brick as before?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Then the officers of
the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, &quot;Why do you
deal this way with your servants?  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> No straw is given to your
servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are
beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> But he said, &quot;You
are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to
Yahweh.'  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Go therefore
now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver
the same number of bricks!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> The officers of the
children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said,
&quot;You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of
bricks!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> They met Moses and
Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> and they said to them, &quot;May
Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be
abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a
sword in their hand to kill us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Moses returned to
Yahweh, and said, &quot;Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people?
Why is it that you have sent me?  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> For since I came to Pharaoh to
speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have
you delivered your people at all.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he
shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his
land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> God spoke to Moses, and
said to him, &quot;I am Yahweh;  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> and I appeared to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not
known to them.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> I have also
established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the
land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Moreover I have heard the groaning
of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have
remembered my covenant.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Therefore tell the children of
Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of
the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem
you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> and I will take you to me for a
people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh
your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
 <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> I will bring you into the
land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will
give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Moses spoke so to the
children of Israel, but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit,
and for cruel bondage.
<p> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> &quot;Go in,
speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out
of his land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Moses spoke before
Yahweh, saying, &quot;Behold, the children of Israel haven't listened to
me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised
lips?&quot;  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Yahweh spoke
to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel,
and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the
land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> These are the heads of
their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch,
and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and
Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite
woman; these are the families of Simeon.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> These are the names of the sons
of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari;
and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.
 <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> The sons of Gershon:
Libni and Shimei, according to their families.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> The sons of Kohath: Amram, and
Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were
one hundred thirty-three years.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their
generations.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> Amram took
Jochebed his father's sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron
and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and
thirty-seven years.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> The
sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and
Elzaphan, and Sithri.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter
of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab
and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> The sons of Korah: Assir, and
Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> Eleazar Aaron's son took one of
the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are
the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their
families.  <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> These are that
Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said, &quot;Bring out the children of
Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.&quot;  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> These are those who spoke to
Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt.
These are that Moses and Aaron.
<p> <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> It happened on the day
when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> that Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, &quot;I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak
to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> Moses said before
Yahweh, &quot;Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh
listen to me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother
shall be your prophet.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> You
shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to
Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and
multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> But Pharaoh will not listen to
you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people
the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
 <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> The Egyptians shall know
that I am Yahweh, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the
children of Israel from among them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Moses and Aaron did so.
As Yahweh commanded them, so they did.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Moses was eighty years old, and
Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
<p> <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
and to Aaron, saying,  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> &quot;When Pharaoh speaks to you,
saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod,
and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Moses and Aaron went
in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded: and Aaron cast
down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a
serpent.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Then Pharaoh
also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians
of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> For they cast down every man his
rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
 <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Pharaoh's heart was
hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
<p> <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go.
 <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> Go to Pharaoh in the
morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the
river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you
shall take in your hand.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> You shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the
God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, &quot;Let my people go,
that they may serve me in the wilderness:&quot; and behold, until now you
haven't listened.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh, &quot;In this you shall know that I am Yahweh. Behold, I will
strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the
river, and they shall be turned to blood.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> The fish that are in the river
shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe
to drink water from the river.&quot;'&quot;  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;Tell
Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,
over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all
their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood
throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels
of stone.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Moses and Aaron did
so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters
that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
 <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> The fish that were in the
river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink
water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
 <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> The magicians of Egypt
did in like manner with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was
hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Pharaoh turned and went into his
house, neither did he lay even this to heart.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> All the Egyptians dug around the
river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the
river.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Seven days were
fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, &quot;This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my
people go, that they may serve me.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> If you refuse to let them go,
behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> and the river shall swarm with
frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your
bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on
your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> and the frogs shall come up both
on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'&quot;  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;Tell
Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the
streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of
Egypt.'&quot;  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Aaron
stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up,
and covered the land of Egypt.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> The magicians did in like manner
with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> Then Pharaoh called for
Moses and Aaron, and said, &quot;Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the
frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they
may sacrifice to Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Moses said to Pharaoh,
&quot;I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you,
and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed
from you and your houses, and remain in the river only.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> He said,
&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Be it according to your word, that you may know that
there is none like Yahweh our God.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> The frogs shall depart from you,
and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They
shall remain in the river only.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Moses and Aaron went
out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he
had brought on Pharaoh.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Yahweh did according to the word
of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out
of the fields.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> They
gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> But when Pharaoh saw that there
was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh
had spoken.
<p> <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth,
that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'&quot;  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> They did so; and Aaron stretched
out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there
were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice
throughout all the land of Egypt.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> The magicians tried with their
enchantments to bring forth lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on
man, and on animal.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> Then
the magicians said to Pharaoh, &quot;This is the finger of God:&quot; and
Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had
spoken.
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he
comes forth to the water; and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says,
&quot;Let my people go, that they may serve me.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Else, if you will not let my
people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your
servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the
Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
they are.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> I will set
apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no
swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh
in the midst of the earth.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> I will put a division between my
people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.&quot;'&quot;
 <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Yahweh did so; and there
came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his
servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by
reason of the swarms of flies.
<p> <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> Pharaoh called for
Moses and for Aaron, and said, &quot;Go, sacrifice to your God in the
land!&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> Moses said, &quot;It
isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the
Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of
the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us?  <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> We will go three days' journey
into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command
us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> Pharaoh said, &quot;I
will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the
wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> Moses said,
&quot;Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms
of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people,
tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting
the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.&quot;  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Moses went out from Pharaoh, and
prayed to Yahweh.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> Yahweh
did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies
from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not
one.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> Pharaoh hardened his
heart this time also, and he didn't let the people go.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Then Yahweh said to
Moses, &quot;Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God
of the Hebrews, says: &quot;Let my people go, that they may serve me.
 <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> For if you refuse to let
them go, and hold them still,  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> behold, the hand of Yahweh is on
your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on
the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous
pestilence.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Yahweh will
make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of
Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of
Israel.&quot;'&quot;  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Yahweh appointed a set time,
saying, &quot;Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.&quot;
 <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Yahweh did that thing on
the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of
the children of Israel, not one died.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there
was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the
heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.
<p> <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses
and to Aaron, &quot;Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let
Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> It shall become small dust over
all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on
man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> They took ashes of the
furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the
sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.
 <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> The magicians couldn't
stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the
magicians, and on all the Egyptians.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Yahweh hardened the heart of
Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.
<p> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell
him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: &quot;Let my
people go, that they may serve me.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> For this time I will send all my
plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your
people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> For now I would have put
forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you
would have been cut off from the earth;  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> but indeed for this cause I have
made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared
throughout all the earth;  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> as you still exalt yourself
against my people, that you won't let them go.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> Behold, tomorrow about this time
I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in
Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> Now therefore command that all of
your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter.
Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home,
the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Those who feared the
word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their
livestock flee into the houses.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Whoever didn't regard the word of
Yahweh left his servants and his livestock in the field.
<p> <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Stretch forth your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in
all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the
field, throughout the land of Egypt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Moses stretched forth
his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder, hail, and lightning
flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.
 <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> So there was very severe
hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the
land of Egypt since it became a nation.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> The hail struck throughout all
the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the
hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
 <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> Only in the land of
Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
<p> <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> Pharaoh sent, and
called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, &quot;I have sinned this
time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> Pray to Yahweh; for there has
been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you
shall stay no longer.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Moses said to him,
&quot;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my
hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more
hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> But as for you and your servants,
I know that you don't yet fear Yahweh God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> The flax and the
barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in
bloom.  <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> But the wheat and
the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> Moses went out of the city from
Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail
ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.  <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> When Pharaoh saw that the rain
and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and
hardened his heart, he and his servants.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> The heart of Pharaoh was
hardened, and he didn't let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had
spoken through Moses.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of
his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> and that you may tell in the
hearing of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done to
Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I
am Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Moses and Aaron went
in to Pharaoh, and said to him, &quot;This is what Yahweh, the God of the
Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let
my people go, that they may serve me.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Or else, if you refuse to let my
people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,
 <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> and they shall cover the
surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They
shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from
the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.
 <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Your houses shall be
filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the
Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen,
since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'&quot; He turned,
and went out from Pharaoh.
<p> <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Pharaoh's servants
said to him, &quot;How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men
go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don't you yet know that Egypt
is destroyed?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Moses and Aaron were
brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, &quot;Go, serve Yahweh your
God; but who are those who will go?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Moses said, &quot;We
will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our
daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold
a feast to Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Yahweh be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See,
evil is clearly before your faces.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Not so! Go now you who are men,
and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!&quot; They were driven out
from Pharaoh's presence.
<p> <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that
they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land,
even all that the hail has left.&quot;  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> Moses stretched forth his rod
over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all
that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind
brought the locusts.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> The
locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders
of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts
as they, neither after them shall be such.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> For they covered the surface of
the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of
the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There
remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the
land of Egypt.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Then
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, &quot;I have
sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Now therefore please forgive my
sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me
this death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> He went out from
Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Yahweh turned an exceeding
strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the <a
href="#N3">Red Sea</a>. There remained not one locust in all the borders
of Egypt.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> But Yahweh
hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness
over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.&quot;  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> Moses stretched forth his hand
toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt
three days.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> They didn't
see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days;
but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
<p> <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Pharaoh called to
Moses, and said, &quot;Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your
herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Moses said, &quot;You
must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may
sacrifice to Yahweh our God.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Our livestock also shall go with
us. There shall not a hoof be left behind, for of it we must take to serve
Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we
come there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> But Yahweh hardened
Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Pharaoh said to him, &quot;Get
away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my
face you shall die!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Moses said, &quot;You
have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt;
afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust
you out altogether.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Speak
now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor,
and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold.&quot;  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> Yahweh gave
the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was
very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and
in the sight of the people.
<p> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Moses said, &quot;This
is what Yahweh says: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of
Egypt,  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> and all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is
behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> There shall be a great cry
throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be
any more.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> But against any
of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue,
against man or animal; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction
between the Egyptians and Israel.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> All these your servants shall
come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, &quot;Get out,
with all the people who follow you;&quot; and after that I will go
out.'&quot; He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
<p> <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in
the land of Egypt.&quot;  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Moses and Aaron did all these
wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't
let the children of Israel go out of his land.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> &quot;This month shall be to you
the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Speak to all the
congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they
shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a
lamb for a household;  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> and
if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next
to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls;
according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
 <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Your lamb shall be
without blemish, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or
from the goats:  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> and you
shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole
assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> They shall take some of the
blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in
which they shall eat it.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> They shall eat the flesh in that
night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with
bitter herbs.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Don't eat
it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its
head, its legs and its inner parts.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> You shall let nothing of it
remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning
you shall burn with fire.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> This is how you shall eat it:
with your waist girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your
hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh's Passover.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> For I will go through the land
of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
judgments: I am Yahweh.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> The blood shall be to you for a
token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass
over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I
strike the land of Egypt.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> This day shall be to you for a
memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh: throughout your
generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
<p> <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> &quot;'Seven days you
shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast
out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day
until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> In the first day there shall be
to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no
manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must
eat, that only may be done by you.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> You shall observe the feast of
unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of
the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your
generations by an ordinance forever.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> In the first month, on the
fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread,
until the twenty first day of the month at evening.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> Seven days shall there be no
yeast found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that
soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
foreigner, or one who is born in the land.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> You shall eat nothing leavened.
In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> Then Moses called for
all the elders of Israel, and said to them, &quot;Draw out, and take lambs
according to your families, and kill the Passover.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> You shall take a bunch of
hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the
lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none
of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> For Yahweh will pass through to
strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the
two doorposts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the
destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> You shall observe this thing for
an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> It shall happen when you have
come to the land which Yahweh will give you, according as he has promised,
that you shall keep this service.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> It will happen, when your
children ask you, 'What do you mean by this service?'  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> that you shall say, 'It is the
sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children
of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our
houses.'&quot;
<p>The people bowed their heads and worshiped.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> The children of Israel went and
did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
<p> <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> It happened at
midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from
the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the
captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.
 <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> Pharaoh rose up in the
night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a
great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one
dead.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> He called for
Moses and Aaron by night, and said, &quot;Rise up, get out from among my
people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you
have said!  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Take both
your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me
also!&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> The Egyptians were
urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they
said, &quot;We are all dead men.&quot;  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> The people took their dough
before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their
clothes on their shoulders.  <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> The children of Israel did
according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of
silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.  <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> Yahweh gave the people favor in
the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked.
They despoiled the Egyptians.
<p> <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> The children of
Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on
foot who were men, besides children.  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> A mixed multitude went up also
with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.  <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> They baked unleavened cakes of
the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened,
because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they
prepared for themselves any food.  <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> Now the time that the children
of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.  <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> It happened at the end of four
hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies
of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.  <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> It is a night to be much
observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is
that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel
throughout their generations.
<p> <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses
and Aaron, &quot;This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no
foreigner eat of it,  <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> but
every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised
him, then shall he eat of it.  <a name="C12V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:45</font></a> A foreigner and a hired servant
shall not eat of it.  <a name="C12V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:46</font></a> In
one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the
flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.
 <a name="C12V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:47</font></a> All the congregation of
Israel shall keep it.  <a name="C12V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:48</font></a> When a stranger shall live as a
foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his
males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall
be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat
of it.  <a name="C12V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:49</font></a> One law shall be
to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner
among you.&quot;  <a name="C12V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:50</font></a> All the
children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they
did.  <a name="C12V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:51</font></a> It happened the
same day, that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of
Egypt by their armies.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> &quot;Sanctify to
me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of
Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Moses said to the
people, &quot;Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of
the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from
this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> This day you go forth in the
month Abib.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> It shall be,
when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the
Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore
to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you
shall keep this service in this month.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Seven days you shall eat
unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.
 <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Unleavened bread shall be
eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with
you, neither shall there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.
 <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> You shall tell your son
in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I
came forth out of Egypt.'  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> It shall be for a sign to you on
your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh
may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of
Egypt.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> You shall
therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
<p> <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> &quot;It shall be,
when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to
you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> that you shall set apart to
Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that
comes from an animal. The males shall be Yahweh's.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Every firstborn of a donkey you
shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall
break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your
sons.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> It shall be, when
your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall
tell him, 'By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the
house of bondage;  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> and it
happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Yahweh killed all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the
firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the
womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> It shall be for a sign on your
hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh
brought us forth out of Egypt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> It happened, when
Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the
land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, &quot;Lest
perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return
to Egypt;&quot;  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> but God
led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the <a
href="#N4">Red Sea</a>; and the children of Israel went up armed out of
the land of Egypt.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> Moses
took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel
swear, saying, &quot;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my
bones away from here with you.&quot;  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> They took their journey from
Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> Yahweh went before them by day
in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar
of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
 <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> the pillar of cloud by
day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> &quot;Speak to
the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth,
between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite
it by the sea.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Pharaoh
will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land. The
wilderness has shut them in.'  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over
all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.&quot; They
did so.
<p> <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> It was told the king
of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his
servants was changed towards the people, and they said, &quot;What is this
we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&quot;  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> He made ready his chariot, and
took his army with him;  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> and he took six hundred chosen
chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
 <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> Yahweh hardened the heart
of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for
the children of Israel went out with a high hand.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> The Egyptians pursued after them:
all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and
overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
<p> <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> When Pharaoh drew
near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the
Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The
children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> They said to Moses,
&quot;Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die
in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out
of Egypt?  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Isn't this the
word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may
serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians,
than that we should die in the wilderness.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Moses said to the
people, &quot;Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of
Yahweh, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have
seen today, you shall never see them again.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Yahweh will fight for you, and
you shall be still.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go
forward.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> Lift up your
rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the
children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
 <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> I, behold, I will harden
the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will
get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots,
and over his horsemen.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> The Egyptians shall know that I
am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his
chariots, and over his horsemen.&quot;  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> The angel of God, who went
before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of
cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> It came between the camp of
Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness,
yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the
night.
<p> <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> Moses stretched out
his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong
east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were
divided.  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> The children of
Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters
were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> The Egyptians pursued, and went
in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his
chariots, and his horsemen.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> It happened in the morning
watch, that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of
fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> He took off their chariot
wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said,
&quot;Let's flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them
against the Egyptians!&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again
on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.&quot;  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> Moses stretched out his hand
over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning
appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the
Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> The waters returned, and covered
the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after
them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> But the children of Israel
walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to
them on their right hand, and on their left.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> Thus Yahweh saved Israel that
day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on
the seashore.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Israel saw
the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared
Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in his servant Moses.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Then Moses and the
children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
<dd>The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
<dt> <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Yah is my strength
and song.
<dd>He has become my salvation.
<dt>This is my God, and I will praise him;
<dd>my father's God, and I will exalt him.
<dt> <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Yahweh is a man of
war.
<dd>Yahweh is his name.
<dt> <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> He has cast Pharaoh's
chariots and his army into the sea.
<dd>His chosen captains are sunk in the <a href="#N5">Red Sea</a>.
<dt> <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> The deeps cover them.
<dd>They went down into the depths like a stone.
<dt> <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Your right hand,
Yahweh, is glorious in power.
<dd>Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.
<dt> <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> In the greatness of
your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you.
<dd>You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.
<dt> <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> With the blast of
your nostrils, the waters were piled up.
<dd>The floods stood upright as a heap.
<dd>The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
<dt> <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> The enemy said, 'I
will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the spoil.
<dd>My desire shall be satisfied on them.
<dd>I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
<dt> <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> You blew with your
wind.
<dd>The sea covered them.
<dd>They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
<dt> <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Who is like you,

<dd>Who is like you, glorious in holiness,
<dd>fearful in praises, doing wonders?
<dt> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> You stretched out
your right hand.
<dd>The earth swallowed them.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> &quot;You, in your
loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed.
<dd>You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
<dt> <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> The peoples have
heard.
<dd>They tremble.
<dd>Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
<dt> <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> Then the chiefs of
Edom were dismayed.
<dd>Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab.
<dd>All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
<dt> <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> Terror and dread
falls on them.
<dd>By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone--
<dd>until your people pass over, Yahweh,
<dd>until the people pass over who you have purchased.
<dd> <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> You shall bring them

<dd>the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.
<dt> <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> Yahweh shall reign
forever and ever.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> For the horses of
Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and
Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of
Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> Miriam the prophetess, the
sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out
after her with tambourines and with dances.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> Miriam answered them,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
<dt>The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> Moses led Israel
onward from the <a href="#N6">Red Sea</a>, and they went out into the
wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found
no water.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> When they came
to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were
bitter. Therefore its name was called <a href="#N7">Marah.</a>  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> The people murmured against
Moses, saying, &quot;What shall we drink?&quot;  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh
showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were
made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there
he tested them;  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> and he
said, &quot;If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his
commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases
on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> They came to Elim,
where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they
encamped there by the waters.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> They took their
journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came
to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of
Egypt.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> The whole
congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Aaron in the wilderness;  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> and the children of Israel said
to them, &quot;We wish that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land
of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for
you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly
with hunger.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> Then said Yahweh to
Moses, &quot;Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the
people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test
them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> It shall come to pass on the
sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall
be twice as much as they gather daily.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Moses and Aaron said
to all the children of Israel, &quot;At evening, then you shall know that
Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> and in the morning, then you
shall see the glory of Yahweh; because he hears your murmurings against
Yahweh. Who are we, that you murmur against us?&quot;  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Moses said, &quot;Now Yahweh
shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to
satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against
him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against
Yahweh.&quot;  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Moses said
to Aaron, &quot;Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come
near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.'&quot;  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> It happened, as Aaron spoke to
the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward
the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.
 <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> &quot;I have
heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At
evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with
bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> It happened at
evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the
dew lay around the camp.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> When the dew that lay had gone,
behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as
the frost on the ground.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> When the children of Israel saw
it, they said one to another, &quot;What is it?&quot; For they didn't know
what it was. Moses said to them, &quot;It is the bread which Yahweh has
given you to eat.&quot;  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> This is the thing which Yahweh
has commanded: &quot;Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an
omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it,
every man for those who are in his tent.&quot;  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> The children of Israel did so,
and gathered some more, some less.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> When they measured it with an
omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little
had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> Moses said to them, &quot;Let no
one leave of it until the morning.&quot;  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Notwithstanding they didn't
listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it
bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> They gathered it morning by
morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it
melted.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> It happened that
on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each
one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> He said to them, &quot;This is
that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath
to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want
to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until
the morning.'&quot;  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> They
laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul,
neither was there any worm in it.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> Moses said, &quot;Eat that
today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in
the field.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> Six days you
shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall
be none.&quot;  <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> It
happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather,
and they found none.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;How
long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?  <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> Behold, because Yahweh has given
you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two
days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the
seventh day.&quot;  <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> So
the people rested on the seventh day.
<p> <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> The house of Israel
called its name <a href="#N8">Manna,</a> and it was like coriander seed,
white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.  <a name="C16V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:32</font></a> Moses said, &quot;This is the
thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept
throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed
you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of
Egypt.'&quot;  <a name="C16V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:33</font></a> Moses said
to Aaron, &quot;Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay
it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.&quot;  <a name="C16V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:34</font></a> As Yahweh commanded Moses, so
Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  <a name="C16V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:35</font></a> The children of Israel ate the
manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the
manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.  <a name="C16V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:36</font></a> Now an omer is the tenth part of
an ephah.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> All the congregation
of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their
journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but
there was no water for the people to drink.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> Therefore the people quarreled
with Moses, and said, &quot;Give us water to drink.&quot;
<p>Moses said to them, &quot;Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test
Yahweh?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> The people were
thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,
&quot;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children,
and our livestock with thirst?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> Moses cried to Yahweh,
saying, &quot;What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to
stone me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you,
and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.
 <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> Behold, I will stand
before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and
water will come out of it, that the people may drink.&quot; Moses did so
in the sight of the elders of Israel.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> He called the name of the place
<a href="#N9">Massah,</a> and <a href="#N10">Meribah,</a> because the
children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying,
&quot;Is Yahweh among us, or not?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> Then Amalek came and
fought with Israel in Rephidim.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Moses said to Joshua,
&quot;Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will
stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand.&quot;  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> So Joshua did as Moses had told
him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top
of the hill.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> It
happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he
let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> But Moses' hands were heavy; and
they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur
held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
side. His hands were steady until sunset.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Joshua defeated Amalek and his
people with the edge of the sword.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of
Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the
sky.&quot;  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> Moses built
an altar, and called its name <a href="#N11">Yahweh our Banner.</a>
 <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> He said, &quot;Yah has
sworn: 'Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to
generation.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> Now Jethro, the priest
of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses,
and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of
Egypt.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Jethro, Moses'
father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,
 <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> and her two sons. The
name of one son was <a href="#N12">Gershom,</a> for Moses said, &quot;I
have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land&quot;.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> The name of the other was <a
href="#N13">Eliezer,</a> for he said, &quot;My father's God was my help
and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword.&quot;  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was
encamped, at the Mountain of God.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> He said to Moses, I, your
father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons
with her.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> Moses went out
to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other
of their welfare, and they came into the tent.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> Moses told his father-in-law all
that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake,
all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh
delivered them.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> Jethro
rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he
had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> Jethro said, &quot;Blessed be
Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of
the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of
the Egyptians.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Now I
know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which
they dealt arrogantly against them.&quot;  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the
elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
<p> <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> It happened on the
next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around
Moses from the morning to the evening.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> When Moses' father-in-law saw
all that he did to the people, he said, &quot;What is this thing that you
do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around
you from morning to evening?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Moses said to his
father-in-law, &quot;Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
 <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> When they have a matter,
they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make
them know the statutes of God, and his laws.&quot;  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Moses' father-in-law said to
him, &quot;The thing that you do is not good.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> You will surely wear away, both
you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you.
You are not able to perform it yourself alone.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Listen now to my voice. I will
give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before
God, and bring the causes to God.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> You shall teach them the
statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must
walk, and the work that they must do.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Moreover you shall provide out
of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust
gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of
hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Let them judge the people at all
times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but
every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for
you, and they shall share the load with you.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> If you will do this thing, and
God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these
people also will go to their place in peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> So Moses listened to
the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Moses chose able men out of all
Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers
of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> They judged the people at all
times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they
judged themselves.  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> Moses
let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> In the third month
after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on
that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> When they had departed from
Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the
wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> Moses went up to God, and Yahweh
called to him out of the mountain, saying, &quot;This is what you shall
tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> 'You have seen what I did to the
Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
 <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> Now therefore, if you
will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own
possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> and you shall be to me a kingdom
of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak
to the children of Israel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Moses came and called
for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which
Yahweh commanded him.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> All
the people answered together, and said, &quot;All that Yahweh has spoken
we will do.&quot;
<p>Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear
when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&quot; Moses told
the words of the people to Yahweh.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;Go
to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash
their garments,  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> and be
ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in
the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> You shall set bounds to the
people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the
mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be
surely put to death.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> No
hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through;
whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds
long, they shall come up to the mountain.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> Moses went down from
the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed
their clothes.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> He said
to the people, &quot;Be ready by the third day. Don't have sexual
relations with a woman.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> It happened on the
third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings,
and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud
trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> Moses led the people out of the
camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.
 <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> Mount Sinai, all it,
smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended
like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
 <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> When the sound of the
trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a
voice.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> Yahweh came down
on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top
of the mountain, and Moses went up.
<p> <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze,
and many of them perish.  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Let the priests also, who come
near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> Moses said to Yahweh,
&quot;The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying,
'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Yahweh said to him,
&quot;Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the
priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break
forth on them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> So Moses went down to
the people, and told them.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> <a href="#N14">God</a>
spoke all these words, saying,  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> &quot;I am Yahweh your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> You shall have no other gods
before me.
<p> <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> &quot;You shall not
make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the
heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
under the earth:  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> you
shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your
God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,
 <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> and showing loving
kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
<p> <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> &quot;You shall not
take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him
guiltless who takes his name in vain.
<p> <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> &quot;Remember the
Sabbath day, to keep it holy.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> You shall labor six days, and do
all your work,  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> but the
seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in
it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your
female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your
gates;  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> for in six days
Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested
the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it
holy.
<p> <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> &quot;Honor your
father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which
Yahweh your God gives you.
<p> <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> &quot;You shall not
murder.
<p> <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> &quot;You shall not
commit adultery.
<p> <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> &quot;You shall not
steal.
<p> <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> &quot;You shall not
give false testimony against your neighbor.
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> &quot;You shall not
covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor
his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor
anything that is your neighbor's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> All the people
perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and
the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at
a distance.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> They said to
Moses, &quot;Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don't let God
speak with us, lest we die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> Moses said to the
people, &quot;Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his
fear may be before you, that you won't sin.&quot;  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> The people stayed at a distance,
and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
<p> <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves
have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> You shall most certainly not
make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves.
 <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> You shall make an altar
of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your
peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record
my name I will come to you and I will bless you.  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> If you make me an altar of
stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool
on it, you have polluted it.  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> Neither shall you go up by steps
to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.'
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> &quot;Now these are
the ordinances which you shall set before them.
<p> <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> &quot;If you buy a
Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go
out free without paying anything.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> If he comes in by himself, he
shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with
him.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> If his master gives
him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children
shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> But if the servant shall plainly
say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;'
 <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> then his master shall
bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and
his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him
for ever.
<p> <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> &quot;If a man sells
his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male
servants do.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> If she
doesn't please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall
let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign
people, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> If he marries her to his son, he
shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> If he takes another wife to
himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital
rights.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> If he doesn't do
these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money.
<p> <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> &quot;One who strikes
a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death,  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> but not if it is unintentional,
but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where he
shall flee.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> If a man
schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him, you shall
take him from my altar, that he may die.
<p> <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> &quot;Anyone who
attacks his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
<p> <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> &quot;Anyone who
kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall
surely be put to death.
<p> <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> &quot;Anyone who
curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
<p> <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> &quot;If men quarrel
and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn't
die, but is confined to bed;  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> if he rises again and walks
around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he
shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing
until he is thoroughly healed.
<p> <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> &quot;If a man
strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he
shall surely be punished.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Notwithstanding, if he gets up
after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property.
<p> <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> &quot;If men fight
and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no
harm follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the woman's husband
demands and the judges allow.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> But if any harm follows, then
you must take life for life,  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
hand for hand, foot for foot,  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> burning for burning, wound for
wound, and bruise for bruise.
<p> <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> &quot;If a man
strikes his servant's eye, or his maid's eye, and destroys it, he shall
let him go free for his eye's sake.  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> If he strikes out his male
servant's tooth, or his female servant's tooth, he shall let him go free
for his tooth's sake.
<p> <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> &quot;If a bull gores
a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its flesh
shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held
responsible.  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> But if the
bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its
owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the
bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death.  <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> If a ransom is laid on him, then
he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him.
 <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> Whether it has gored a
son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done
to him.  <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> If the bull
gores a male servant or a female servant, thirty shekels of silver shall
be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.
<p> <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> &quot;If a man opens
a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn't cover it, and a bull or a donkey
falls into it,  <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> the owner
of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the
dead animal shall be his.
<p> <a name="C21V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:35</font></a> &quot;If one man's
bull injures another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live
bull, and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.
 <a name="C21V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:36</font></a> Or if it is known that
the bull was in the habit of goring in the past, and its owner has not
kept it in, he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall
be his own.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> &quot;If a man steals
an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it; he shall pay five oxen for an
ox, and four sheep for a sheep.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> If the thief is found breaking
in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed
for him.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> If the sun has
risen on him, there shall be guilt of bloodshed for him; he shall make
restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
 <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> If the stolen property is
found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay
double.
<p> <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> &quot;If a man causes
a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets his animal loose, and it grazes
in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own
field, and from the best of his own vineyard.
<p> <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> &quot;If fire breaks
out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing
grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall surely
make restitution.
<p> <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> &quot;If a man
delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of
the man's house; if the thief is found, he shall pay double.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> If the thief isn't found, then
the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out if he hasn't
put his hand to his neighbor's goods.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> For every matter of trespass,
whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind
of lost thing, about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of both
parties shall come before God. He whom God condemns shall pay double to
his neighbor.
<p> <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> &quot;If a man
delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep,
and it dies or is injured, or driven away, no man seeing it;  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> the oath of Yahweh shall be
between them both, whether he hasn't put his hand to his neighbor's goods;
and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> But if it is stolen from him, he
shall make restitution to its owner.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> If it is torn in pieces, let him
bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn.
<p> <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> &quot;If a man
borrows anything of his neighbor's, and it is injured, or dies, its owner
not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> If its owner is with it, he
shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.
<p> <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> &quot;If a man
entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married, and lies with her, he
shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> If her father utterly refuses to
give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
<p> <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> &quot;You shall not

<p> <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> &quot;He who
sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only, shall be utterly destroyed.
<p> <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> &quot;You shall not
wrong an alien, neither shall you oppress him, for you were aliens in the
land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> &quot;You shall not
take advantage of any widow or fatherless child.  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> If you take advantage of them at
all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> and my wrath will grow hot, and
I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your
children fatherless.
<p> <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> &quot;If you lend
money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to him as
a creditor; neither shall you charge him interest.  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> If you take your neighbor's
garment as collateral, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes
down,  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> for that is his
only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What would he sleep in? It
will happen, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.
<p> <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> &quot;You shall not
blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
<p> <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> &quot;You shall not
delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses.
<p>&quot;You shall give the firstborn of your sons to me.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> You shall do likewise with your
cattle and with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with its mother, then
on the eighth day you shall give it to me.
<p> <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> &quot;You shall be
holy men to me, therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by
animals in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> &quot;You shall not
spread a false report. Don't join your hand with the wicked to be a
malicious witness.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> You
shall not follow a crowd to do evil; neither shall you testify in court to
side with a multitude to pervert justice;  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> neither shall you favor a poor
man in his cause.
<p> <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> &quot;If you meet your
enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to
him again.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> If you see the
donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden, don't leave him,
you shall surely help him with it.
<p> <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> &quot;You shall not
deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
<p> <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> &quot;Keep far from a
false charge, and don't kill the innocent and righteous: for I will not
justify the wicked.
<p> <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> &quot;You shall take
no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight and perverts the words
of the righteous.
<p> <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> &quot;You shall not
oppress an alien, for you know the heart of an alien, seeing you were
aliens in the land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> &quot;For six years
you shall sow your land, and shall gather in its increase,  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> but the seventh year you shall
let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what
they leave the animal of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall
deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove.
<p> <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> &quot;Six days you
shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox
and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the alien
may be refreshed.
<p> <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> &quot;Be careful to
do all things that I have said to you; and don't invoke the name of other
gods, neither let them be heard out of your mouth.
<p> <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> &quot;You shall
observe a feast to me three times a year.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> You shall observe the feast of
unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I
commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came
out from Egypt), and no one shall appear before me empty.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> And the feast of harvest, the
first fruits of your labors, which you sow in the field: and the feast of
harvest, at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out of the
field.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> Three times in
the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> &quot;You shall not
offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat
of my feast remain all night until the morning.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> The first of the first fruits of
your ground you shall bring into the house of Yahweh your God.
<p>&quot;You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
<p> <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> &quot;Behold, I send
an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the
place which I have prepared.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> Pay attention to him, and listen
to his voice. Don't provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience,
for my name is in him.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> But if you indeed listen to his
voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies,
and an adversary to your adversaries.  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> For my angel shall go before
you, and bring you in to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the
Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> You shall not bow down to their
gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly
overthrow them and demolish their pillars.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> You shall serve Yahweh your God,
and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away
from your midst.  <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> No one
will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your
days.  <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> I will send my
terror before you, and will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I
will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.  <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> I will send the hornet before
you, which will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from
before you.  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> I will not
drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate,
and the animals of the field multiply against you.  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> Little by little I will drive
them out from before you, until you have increased and inherit the land.
 <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> I will set your border
from the <a href="#N15">Red Sea</a> even to the sea of the Philistines,
and from the wilderness to the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants
of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.
 <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> You shall make no
covenant with them, nor with their gods.  <a name="C23V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:33</font></a> They shall not dwell in your
land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it
will surely be a snare to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> He said to Moses,
&quot;Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of
the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> Moses alone shall come near to
Yahweh, but they shall not come near, neither shall the people go up with
him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> Moses came and told
the people all the words of Yahweh, and all the ordinances; and all the
people answered with one voice, and said, &quot;All the words which Yahweh
has spoken will we do.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> Moses wrote all the
words of Yahweh, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar
under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
 <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> He sent young men of the
children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace
offerings of cattle to Yahweh.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> Moses took half of the blood and
put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> He took the book of the covenant
and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, &quot;All that
Yahweh has spoken will we do, and be obedient.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> Moses took the blood,
and sprinkled it on the people, and said, &quot;Look, this is the blood of
the covenant, which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these
words.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> Then Moses, Aaron,
Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> They saw the God of Israel.
Under his feet was like a paved work of <a href="#N16">sapphire</a> stone,
like the skies for clearness.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> He didn't lay his hand on the
nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.
<p> <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you
the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written,
that you may teach them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> Moses rose up with
Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up onto God's Mountain.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> He said to the elders,
&quot;Wait here for us, until we come again to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur
are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> Moses went up on the
mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> The glory of Yahweh settled on
Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The seventh day he called
to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> The appearance of the glory of
Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of
the children of Israel.  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> Moses entered into the midst of
the cloud, and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain
forty days and forty nights.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> &quot;Speak to
the children of Israel, that they take an offering for me. From everyone
whose heart makes him willing you shall take my offering.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> This is the offering which you
shall take from them: gold, silver, brass,  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> blue, purple, scarlet, fine
linen, goats' hair,  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> rams'
skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> oil for the light, spices for the
anointing oil and for the sweet incense,  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> onyx stones, and stones to be set
for the ephod and for the breastplate.  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> Let them make me a sanctuary,
that I may dwell among them.  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> According to all that I show you,
the pattern of the tent, and the pattern of all of its furniture, even so
you shall make it.
<p> <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> &quot;They shall make
an ark of acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, its
breadth a cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half its height.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> You shall overlay it with pure
gold. You shall overlay it inside and outside, and you shall make a gold
molding around it.  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> You
shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in its four feet. Two
rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of
it.  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> You shall make poles
of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> You shall put the poles into the
rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> The poles shall be in the rings
of the ark. They shall not be taken from it.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> You shall put the testimony
which I shall give you into the ark.  <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> You shall make a mercy seat of
pure gold. Two and a half cubits shall be its length, and a cubit and a
half its breadth.  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> You
shall make two cherubim of hammered gold. You shall make them at the two
ends of the mercy seat.  <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> Make one cherub at the one end,
and one cherub at the other end. You shall make the cherubim on its two
ends of one piece with the mercy seat.  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> The cherubim shall spread out
their wings upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their
faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim shall be toward the
mercy seat.  <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> You shall
put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the
testimony that I will give you.  <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> There I will meet with you, and
I will tell you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim
which are on the ark of the testimony, all that I command you for the
children of Israel.
<p> <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> &quot;You shall make
a table of acacia wood. Two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its
breadth, and one and a half cubits its height.  <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> You shall overlay it with pure
gold, and make a gold molding around it.  <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> You shall make a rim of a
handbreadth around it. You shall make a golden molding on its rim around
it.  <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> You shall make four
rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that are on
its four feet.  <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> the rings
shall be close to the rim, for places for the poles to carry the table.
 <a name="C25V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:28</font></a> You shall make the poles

with them.  <a name="C25V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:29</font></a> You shall
make its dishes, its spoons, its ladles, and its bowls to pour out
offerings with. You shall make them of pure gold.  <a name="C25V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:30</font></a> You shall set bread of the
presence on the table before me always.
<p> <a name="C25V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:31</font></a> &quot;You shall make
a lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work shall the lampstand be made,
even its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers, shall be of

that is on them, and burn them on the altar.  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> But the flesh of the bull, and
its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside of the camp: it
is a sin offering.
<p> <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> &quot;You shall also
take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head
of the ram.  <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> You shall
kill the ram, and you shall take its blood, and sprinkle it around on the
altar.  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> You shall cut the
ram into its pieces, and wash its innards, and its legs, and put them with
its pieces, and with its head.  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> You shall burn the whole ram on
the altar: it is a burnt offering to Yahweh; it is a pleasant aroma, an
offering made by fire to Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> &quot;You shall take
the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of
the ram.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> Then you shall
kill the ram, and take some of its blood, and put it on the tip of the
right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on
the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, and
sprinkle the blood around on the altar.  <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> You shall take of the blood that
is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and
on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with
him: and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and his sons, and his
sons' garments with him.  <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> Also you shall take some of the
ram's fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the innards, the cover of the
liver, the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for
it is a ram of consecration),  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> and one loaf of bread, one cake
of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that
is before Yahweh.  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> You
shall put all of this in Aaron's hands, and in his sons' hands, and shall
wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> You shall take them from their
hands, and burn them on the altar on the burnt offering, for a pleasant
aroma before Yahweh: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> &quot;You shall take
the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering
before Yahweh: and it shall be your portion.  <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> You shall sanctify the breast of
the wave offering, and the thigh of the wave offering, which is waved, and
which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for
Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:  <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> and it shall be for Aaron and
his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel; for it is a
wave offering: and it shall be a wave offering from the children of Israel
of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their wave offering to
Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> &quot;The holy
garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them,
and to be consecrated in them.  <a name="C29V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:30</font></a> Seven days shall the son who is
priest in his place put them on, when he comes into the Tent of Meeting to
minister in the holy place.
<p> <a name="C29V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:31</font></a> &quot;You shall take
the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.  <a name="C29V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:32</font></a> Aaron and his sons shall eat the
flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the
Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C29V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:33</font></a> They
shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and
sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.
 <a name="C29V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:34</font></a> If anything of the flesh
of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you
shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
holy.
<p> <a name="C29V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:35</font></a> &quot;You shall do so
to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. You
shall consecrate them seven days.  <a name="C29V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:36</font></a> Every day you shall offer the
bull of sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when
you make atonement for it; and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
 <a name="C29V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:37</font></a> Seven days you shall
make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most
holy; whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
<p> <a name="C29V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:38</font></a> &quot;Now this is
that which you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day
continually.  <a name="C29V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:39</font></a> The one
lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at
evening:  <a name="C29V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:40</font></a> and with the
one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part
of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink
offering.  <a name="C29V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:41</font></a> The other lamb
you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it according to the meal
offering of the morning, and according to its drink offering, for a
pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  <a name="C29V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:42</font></a> It shall be a continual burnt
offering throughout your generations at the door of the Tent of Meeting
before Yahweh, where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.  <a name="C29V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:43</font></a> There I will meet with the
children of Israel; and the place shall be sanctified by my glory.  <a name="C29V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:44</font></a> I will sanctify the Tent of
Meeting and the altar: Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to
minister to me in the priest's office.  <a name="C29V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:45</font></a> I will dwell among the children
of Israel, and will be their God.  <a name="C29V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:46</font></a> They shall know that I am Yahweh
their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might
dwell among them: I am Yahweh their God.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> &quot;You shall make
an altar to burn incense on. You shall make it of acacia wood.  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> Its length shall be a cubit, and
its breadth a cubit. It shall be square, and its height shall be two
cubits. Its horns shall be of one piece with it.  <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> You shall overlay it with pure
gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns; and you shall make a
gold molding around it.  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> You shall make two golden rings
for it under its molding; on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make
them; and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it.
 <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> You shall make the poles
of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> You shall put it before the veil
that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over
the testimony, where I will meet with you.  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> Aaron shall burn incense of sweet
spices on it every morning. When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.
 <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> When Aaron lights the
lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Yahweh
throughout your generations.  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> You shall offer no strange
incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and you shall pour
no drink offering on it.  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> Aaron shall make atonement on
its horns once in the year; with the blood of the sin offering of
atonement once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout your
generations. It is most holy to Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> &quot;When you take a census of
the children of Israel, according to those who are numbered among them,
then each man shall give a ransom for his soul to Yahweh, when you number
them; that there be no plague among them when you number them.  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> They shall give this, everyone
who passes over to those who are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel
of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an
offering to Yahweh.  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> Everyone who passes over to
those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the
offering to Yahweh.  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> The
rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half
shekel, when they give the offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your
souls.  <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> You shall take
the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for
the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the
children of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> &quot;You
shall also make a basin of brass, and its base of brass, in which to wash.
You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall
put water in it.  <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> Aaron
and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.  <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> When they go into the Tent of
Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come
near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
 <a name="C30V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:21</font></a> So they shall wash their
hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever
to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their
generations.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:22</font></a> Moreover Yahweh spoke
to Moses, saying,  <a name="C30V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:23</font></a> &quot;Also take fine spices: of
liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels; and of fragrant cinnamon half as much,
even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;
 <a name="C30V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:24</font></a> and of cassia five
hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin of olive oil.
 <a name="C30V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:25</font></a> You shall make it a holy
anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it
shall be a holy anointing oil.  <a name="C30V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:26</font></a> You shall use it to anoint the
Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony,  <a name="C30V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:27</font></a> the table and all its articles,
the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,  <a name="C30V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:28</font></a> the altar of burnt offering with
all its utensils, and the basin with its base.  <a name="C30V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:29</font></a> You shall sanctify them, that
they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.  <a name="C30V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:30</font></a> You shall anoint Aaron and his
sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's
office.  <a name="C30V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:31</font></a> You shall speak
to the children of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to
me throughout your generations.  <a name="C30V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:32</font></a> It shall not be poured on man's
flesh, neither shall you make any like it, according to its composition:
it is holy. It shall be holy to you.  <a name="C30V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:33</font></a> Whoever compounds any like it,
or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his
people.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:34</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum;
sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be an equal
weight;  <a name="C30V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:35</font></a> and you shall
make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with
salt, pure and holy:  <a name="C30V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:36</font></a> and
you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the
testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be
to you most holy.  <a name="C30V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:37</font></a> The
incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not
make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Yahweh.  <a name="C30V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:38</font></a> Whoever shall make any like
that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> &quot;Behold, I
have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe
of Judah:  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> and I have
filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in
knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,  <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> to devise skillful works, to work
in gold, and in silver, and in brass,  <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> and in cutting of stones for
setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
 <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> I, behold, I have
appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and
in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may
make all that I have commanded you:  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> the Tent of Meeting, the ark of
the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the
Tent,  <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> the table and its
vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,
 <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> the altar of burnt
offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> the finely worked garments--the
holy garments for Aaron the priest--the garments of his sons to minister
in the priest's office,  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> the anointing oil, and the
incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have
commanded you they shall do.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> &quot;Speak also to the children
of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a
sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know
that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.  <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> You shall keep the Sabbath
therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be
put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut
off from among his people.  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Six days shall work be done, but
on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever
does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.  <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> Therefore the children of Israel
shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their
generations, for a perpetual covenant.  <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> It is a sign between me and the
children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth,
and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> He gave to Moses,
when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the
testimony, stone tablets, written with God's finger.
<p> <a name="C32V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:1</font></a> When the people saw
that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered
themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, &quot;Come, make us gods,
which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up
out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:2</font></a> Aaron said to them,
&quot;Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of
your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:3</font></a> All the people took
off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
 <a name="C32V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:4</font></a> He received what they
handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten
calf; and they said, &quot;These are your gods, Israel, which brought you
up out of the land of Egypt.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:5</font></a> When Aaron saw this,
he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said,
&quot;Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:6</font></a> They rose up early on
the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings;
and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
<p> <a name="C32V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:7</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
&quot;Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of
Egypt, have corrupted themselves!  <a name="C32V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:8</font></a> They have turned aside quickly
out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten
calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These
are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of
Egypt.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:9</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked
people.  <a name="C32V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:10</font></a> Now therefore
leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may
consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:11</font></a> Moses begged Yahweh
his God, and said, &quot;Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your
people, that you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great
power and with a mighty hand?  <a name="C32V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:12</font></a> Why should the Egyptians speak,
saying, 'He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains,
and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce
wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.  <a name="C32V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:13</font></a> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to
them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this
land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall
inherit it forever.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:14</font></a> Yahweh repented of
the evil which he said he would do to his people.
<p> <a name="C32V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:15</font></a> Moses turned, and
went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his
hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and
on the other they were written.  <a name="C32V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:16</font></a> The tablets were the work of
God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
<p> <a name="C32V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:17</font></a> When Joshua heard the
noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, &quot;There is the
noise of war in the camp.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:18</font></a> He said, &quot;It
isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of
those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I
hear.&quot;  <a name="C32V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:19</font></a> It happened,
as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing:
and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and
broke them beneath the mountain.  <a name="C32V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:20</font></a> He took the calf which they had
made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the
water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
<p> <a name="C32V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:21</font></a> Moses said to Aaron,
&quot;What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin
on them?&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:22</font></a> Aaron said,
&quot;Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that
they are set on evil.  <a name="C32V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:23</font></a> For they said to me, 'Make us
gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought
us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'
 <a name="C32V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:24</font></a> I said to them, 'Whoever
has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it
into the fire, and out came this calf.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:25</font></a> When Moses saw that
the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision
among their enemies),  <a name="C32V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:26</font></a> then Moses stood in the gate of
the camp, and said, &quot;Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me!&quot;
<p>All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.  <a name="C32V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:27</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go
back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill
his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his
neighbor.'&quot;  <a name="C32V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:28</font></a> The
sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the
people that day about three thousand men.  <a name="C32V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:29</font></a> Moses said, &quot;Consecrate
yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against
his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:30</font></a> It happened on the
next day, that Moses said to the people, &quot;You have sinned a great
sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your
sin.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:31</font></a> Moses returned to
Yahweh, and said, &quot;Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have
made themselves gods of gold.  <a name="C32V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:32</font></a> Yet now, if you will, forgive
their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have
written.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:33</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
 <a name="C32V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:34</font></a> Now go, lead the people
to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go
before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for
their sin.&quot;  <a name="C32V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:35</font></a> Yahweh
struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
&quot;Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up
out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'  <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> I will send an angel before you;
and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the
Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> to a land flowing with milk and
honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a
stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:4</font></a> When the people heard
this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.
<p> <a name="C33V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:5</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I
were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you.
Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do
to you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:6</font></a> The children of Israel
stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
<p> <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> Now Moses used to take
the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he
called it &quot;The Tent of Meeting.&quot; It happened that everyone who
sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.
 <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> It happened that when
Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood,
everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the
Tent.  <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> It happened, when
Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at
the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.  <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> All the people saw the pillar of
cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and
worshiped, everyone at their tent door.  <a name="C33V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:11</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses face to
face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but
his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the
Tent.
<p> <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> Moses said to Yahweh,
&quot;Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me
know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name,
and you have also found favor in my sight.'  <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> Now therefore, if I have found
favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so
that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your
people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:14</font></a> He said, &quot;My
presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:15</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here.
 <a name="C33V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:16</font></a> For how would people
know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in
that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all
the people who are on the surface of the earth?&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found
favor in my sight, and I know you by name.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> He said, &quot;Please
show me your glory.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:19</font></a> He said, &quot;I will
make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh
before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show
mercy on whom I will show mercy.&quot;  <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> He said, &quot;You cannot see my
face, for man may not see me and live.&quot;  <a name="C33V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:21</font></a> Yahweh also said, &quot;Behold,
there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.  <a name="C33V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:22</font></a> It will happen, while my glory
passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you
with my hand until I have passed by;  <a name="C33V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:23</font></a> then I will take away my hand,
and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the
tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.  <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> Be ready by the morning, and come
up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the
top of the mountain.  <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> No
one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the
mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> He chiseled two
tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning,
and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his
hand two stone tablets.  <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> Yahweh descended in the cloud,
and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> Yahweh passed by before him, and
proclaimed, &quot;Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to
anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,  <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> keeping loving kindness for
thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by
no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth
generation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> Moses hurried and
bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.  <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> He said, &quot;If now I have
found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of
us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our
sin, and take us for your inheritance.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> He said,
&quot;Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels,
such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all
the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an
awesome thing that I do with you.  <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> Observe that which I command you
this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the
Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> Be careful, lest you make a
covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be
for a snare in the midst of you:  <a name="C34V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:13</font></a> but you shall break down their
altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their
Asherim;  <a name="C34V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:14</font></a> for you shall
worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
 <a name="C34V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:15</font></a> Don't make a covenant
with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after
their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of
his sacrifice;  <a name="C34V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:16</font></a> and you
take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the
prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after
their gods.  <a name="C34V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:17</font></a> You shall
make no cast idols for yourselves.
<p> <a name="C34V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:18</font></a> &quot;You shall keep
the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the
month Abib you came out from Egypt.  <a name="C34V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:19</font></a> All that opens the womb is mine;
and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
 <a name="C34V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:20</font></a> The firstborn of a
donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then
you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.
No one shall appear before me empty.
<p> <a name="C34V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:21</font></a> &quot;Six days you
shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in
harvest you shall rest.  <a name="C34V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:22</font></a> You shall observe the feast of
weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at
the year's end.  <a name="C34V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:23</font></a> Three
times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the
God of Israel.  <a name="C34V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:24</font></a> For I
will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall
any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God,
three times in the year.
<p> <a name="C34V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:25</font></a> &quot;You shall not
offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the
sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.  <a name="C34V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:26</font></a> You shall bring the first of the
first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God. You shall not
boil a young goat in its mother's milk.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:27</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Write you these words: for in accordance with these words I have
made a covenant with you and with Israel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:28</font></a> He was there with
Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water.
He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
<p> <a name="C34V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:29</font></a> It happened, when
Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in
Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn't know
that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
 <a name="C34V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:30</font></a> When Aaron and all the
children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they
were afraid to come near him.  <a name="C34V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:31</font></a> Moses called to them, and Aaron
and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to
them.  <a name="C34V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:32</font></a> Afterward all the
children of Israel came near, and he gave them all of the commandments
that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.  <a name="C34V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:33</font></a> When Moses was done speaking
with them, he put a veil on his face.  <a name="C34V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:34</font></a> But when Moses went in before
Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he
came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
 <a name="C34V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:35</font></a> The children of Israel
saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the
veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
<p> <a name="C35V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:1</font></a> Moses assembled all
the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, &quot;These
are the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you should do them.  <a name="C35V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:2</font></a> 'Six days shall work be done, but
on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn
rest to Yahweh: whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.  <a name="C35V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:3</font></a> You shall kindle no fire
throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:4</font></a> Moses spoke to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, saying, &quot;This is the thing
which Yahweh commanded, saying,  <a name="C35V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:5</font></a> 'Take from among you an offering
to Yahweh. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Yahweh's
offering: gold, silver, brass,  <a name="C35V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:6</font></a> blue, purple, scarlet, fine
linen, goats' hair,  <a name="C35V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:7</font></a> rams'
skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,  <a name="C35V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:8</font></a> oil for the light, spices for the
anointing oil and for the sweet incense,  <a name="C35V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:9</font></a> onyx stones, and stones to be set
for the ephod and for the breastplate.
<p> <a name="C35V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:10</font></a> &quot;'Let every
wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Yahweh has commanded:
 <a name="C35V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:11</font></a> the tent, its outer
covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its
sockets;  <a name="C35V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:12</font></a> the ark, and
its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;  <a name="C35V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:13</font></a> the table with its poles and all
its vessels, and the show bread;  <a name="C35V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:14</font></a> the lampstand also for the
light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the oil for the light;  <a name="C35V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:15</font></a> and the altar of incense with
its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door,
at the door of the tent;  <a name="C35V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:16</font></a> the altar of burnt offering,
with its grating of brass, it poles, and all its vessels, the basin and
its base;  <a name="C35V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:17</font></a> the hangings
of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of
the court;  <a name="C35V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:18</font></a> the pins of
the tent, the pins of the court, and their cords;  <a name="C35V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:19</font></a> the finely worked garments, for
ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and
the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:20</font></a> All the congregation
of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.  <a name="C35V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:21</font></a> They came, everyone whose heart
stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought
Yahweh's offering, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its
service, and for the holy garments.  <a name="C35V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:22</font></a> They came, both men and women,
as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet
rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an
offering of gold to Yahweh.  <a name="C35V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:23</font></a> Everyone, with whom was found
blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and
sea cow hides, brought them.  <a name="C35V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:24</font></a> Everyone who did offer an
offering of silver and brass brought Yahweh's offering; and everyone, with
whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
 <a name="C35V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:25</font></a> All the women who were
wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun,
the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.  <a name="C35V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:26</font></a> All the women whose heart
stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair.  <a name="C35V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:27</font></a> The rulers brought the onyx
stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastplate;
 <a name="C35V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:28</font></a> and the spice, and the
oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
 <a name="C35V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:29</font></a> The children of Israel
brought a freewill offering to Yahweh; every man and woman, whose heart
made them willing to bring for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to
be made by Moses.
<p> <a name="C35V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:30</font></a> Moses said to the
children of Israel, &quot;Behold, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the
son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.  <a name="C35V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:31</font></a> He has filled him with the
Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all
manner of workmanship;  <a name="C35V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:32</font></a> and to make skillful works, to
work in gold, in silver, in brass,  <a name="C35V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:33</font></a> in cutting of stones for
setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful
workmanship.  <a name="C35V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:34</font></a> He has put
in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.  <a name="C35V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:35</font></a> He has filled them with wisdom
of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, of the
skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet,
and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any
workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> &quot;Bezalel and
Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom Yahweh has put
wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service
of the sanctuary, according to all that Yahweh has commanded.&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> Moses called Bezalel
and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Yahweh had put
wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do
it:  <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> and they received
from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for
the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They
brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> All the wise men, who performed
all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did.
 <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> They spoke to Moses,
saying, &quot;The people bring much more than enough for the service of
the work which Yahweh commanded to make.&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> Moses gave
commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp,
saying, &quot;Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the
offering for the sanctuary.&quot; So the people were restrained from
bringing.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> For the stuff
they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
<p> <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> All the wise-hearted
men among those who did the work made the tent with ten curtains; of fine
twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the
skillful workman, they made them.  <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> The length of each curtain was
twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the
curtains had one measure.  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> He coupled five curtains to one
another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.  <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> He made loops of blue on the
edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in
the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.  <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> He made fifty loops in the one
curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in
the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another.  <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> He made fifty clasps of gold,
and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tent was a
unit.
<p> <a name="C36V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:14</font></a> He made curtains of
goats' hair for a covering over the tent. He made them eleven curtains.
 <a name="C36V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:15</font></a> The length of each
curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain.
The eleven curtains had one measure.  <a name="C36V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:16</font></a> He coupled five curtains by
themselves, and six curtains by themselves.  <a name="C36V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:17</font></a> He made fifty loops on the edge
of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops
on the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.
 <a name="C36V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:18</font></a> He made fifty clasps of
brass to couple the tent together, that it might be a unit.  <a name="C36V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:19</font></a> He made a covering for the tent
of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sea cow hides above.
<p> <a name="C36V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:20</font></a> He made the boards
for the tent of acacia wood, standing up.  <a name="C36V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:21</font></a> Ten cubits was the length of a
board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.  <a name="C36V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:22</font></a> Each board had two tenons,
joined one to another. He made all the boards of the tent this way.
 <a name="C36V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:23</font></a> He made the boards for
the tent: twenty boards for the south side southward.  <a name="C36V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:24</font></a> He made forty sockets of silver
under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons,
and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.  <a name="C36V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:25</font></a> For the second side of the tent,

silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
 <a name="C36V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:27</font></a> For the far part of the
tent westward he made six boards.  <a name="C36V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:28</font></a> He made two boards for the
corners of the tent in the far part.  <a name="C36V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:29</font></a> They were double beneath, and in
like manner they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did thus to
both of them in the two corners.  <a name="C36V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:30</font></a> There were eight boards, and
their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
<p> <a name="C36V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:31</font></a> He made bars of
acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tent,  <a name="C36V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:32</font></a> and five bars for the boards of
the other side of the tent, and five bars for the boards of the tent for
the hinder part westward.  <a name="C36V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:33</font></a> He made the middle bar to pass
through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.  <a name="C36V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:34</font></a> He overlaid the boards with
gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid
the bars with gold.
<p> <a name="C36V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:35</font></a> He made the veil of
blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim. He made it
the work of a skillful workman.  <a name="C36V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:36</font></a> He made four pillars of acacia
for it, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold. He cast
four sockets of silver for them.  <a name="C36V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:37</font></a> He made a screen for the door of
the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an
embroiderer;  <a name="C36V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:38</font></a> and the
five pillars of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their
fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of brass.
<p> <a name="C37V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:1</font></a> Bezalel made the ark
of acacia wood. Its length was two and a half cubits, and its breadth a
cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half its height.  <a name="C37V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:2</font></a> He overlaid it with pure gold
inside and outside, and made a molding of gold for it around it.  <a name="C37V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:3</font></a> He cast four rings of gold for
it, in its four feet; even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its
other side.  <a name="C37V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:4</font></a> He made poles
of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.  <a name="C37V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:5</font></a> He put the poles into the rings
on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.  <a name="C37V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:6</font></a> He made a mercy seat of pure
gold. Its length was two and a half cubits, and a cubit and a half its
breadth.  <a name="C37V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:7</font></a> He made two
cherubim of gold. He made them of beaten work, at the two ends of the
mercy seat;  <a name="C37V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:8</font></a> one cherub at
the one end, and one cherub at the other end. He made the cherubim of one
piece with the mercy seat at its two ends.  <a name="C37V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:9</font></a> The cherubim spread out their
wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces
toward one another. The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
<p> <a name="C37V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:10</font></a> He made the table of
acacia wood. Its length was two cubits, and its breadth was a cubit, and

handbreadth around it, and made a golden molding on its border around it.
 <a name="C37V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:13</font></a> He cast four rings of
gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that were on its four
feet.  <a name="C37V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:14</font></a> The rings were
close by the border, the places for the poles to carry the table.  <a name="C37V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:15</font></a> He made the poles of acacia
wood, and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.  <a name="C37V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:16</font></a> He made the vessels which were
on the table, its dishes, its spoons, its bowls, and its pitchers with
which to pour out, of pure gold.
<p> <a name="C37V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:17</font></a> He made the lampstand
of pure gold. He made the lampstand of beaten work. Its base, its shaft,
its cups, its buds, and its flowers were of one piece with it.  <a name="C37V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:18</font></a> There were six branches going
out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of its one side, and
three branches of the lampstand out of its other side:  <a name="C37V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:19</font></a> three cups made like almond
blossoms in one branch, a bud and a flower, and three cups made like
almond blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower: so for the six
branches going out of the lampstand.  <a name="C37V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:20</font></a> In the lampstand were four cups

one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and
a bud under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going
out of it.  <a name="C37V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:22</font></a> Their buds
and their branches were of one piece with it. The whole thing was one
beaten work of pure gold.  <a name="C37V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:23</font></a> He made its seven lamps, and its
snuffers, and its snuff dishes, of pure gold.  <a name="C37V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:24</font></a> He made it of a talent of pure
gold, with all its vessels.
<p> <a name="C37V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:25</font></a> He made the altar of
incense of acacia wood. It was square: its length was a cubit, and its
breadth a cubit. Its height was two cubits. Its horns were of one piece
with it.  <a name="C37V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:26</font></a> He overlaid it
with pure gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns. He made a
gold molding around it.  <a name="C37V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:27</font></a> He made two golden rings for it
under its molding crown, on its two ribs, on its two sides, for places for
poles with which to carry it.  <a name="C37V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:28</font></a> He made the poles of acacia

burnt offering of acacia wood. It was square. Its length was five cubits,
its breadth was five cubits, and its height was three cubits.  <a name="C38V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:2</font></a> He made its horns on its four
corners. Its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with
brass.  <a name="C38V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:3</font></a> He made all the
vessels of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and
the fire pans. He made all its vessels of brass.  <a name="C38V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:4</font></a> He made for the altar a grating
of a network of brass, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway
up.  <a name="C38V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:5</font></a> He cast four rings
for the four ends of brass grating, to be places for the poles.  <a name="C38V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:6</font></a> He made the poles of acacia wood,
and overlaid them with brass.  <a name="C38V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:7</font></a> He put the poles into the rings
on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with
planks.
<p> <a name="C38V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:8</font></a> He made the basin of
brass, and its base of brass, out of the mirrors of the ministering women
who ministered at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
<p> <a name="C38V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:9</font></a> He made the court: for
the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined
linen, one hundred cubits;  <a name="C38V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:10</font></a> their pillars were twenty, and
their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets

other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were
hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
 <a name="C38V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:16</font></a> All the hangings around
the court were of fine twined linen.  <a name="C38V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:17</font></a> The sockets for the pillars were
of brass. The hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver; and
the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the
court were filleted with silver.  <a name="C38V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:18</font></a> The screen for the gate of the
court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine
twined linen. Twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
was five cubits, like to the hangings of the court.  <a name="C38V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:19</font></a> Their pillars were four, and
their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of
their capitals, and their fillets, of silver.  <a name="C38V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:20</font></a> All the pins of the tent, and
around the court, were of brass.
<p> <a name="C38V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:21</font></a> This is the amount of
material used for the tent, even the Tent of the Testimony, as they were
counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the
Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.  <a name="C38V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:22</font></a> Bezalel the son of Uri, the son
of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
 <a name="C38V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:23</font></a> With him was Oholiab,
the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful
workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine
linen.
<p> <a name="C38V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:24</font></a> All the gold that was
used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the
offering, was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels, after
the shekel of the sanctuary.  <a name="C38V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:25</font></a> The silver of those who were
numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents, and one thousand
seven hundred seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
 <a name="C38V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:26</font></a> a beka a head, that is,
half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed
over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six
hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men.  <a name="C38V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:27</font></a> The one hundred talents of
silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of
the veil; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents, a talent for a
socket.  <a name="C38V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:28</font></a> Of the one
thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars,
overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them.  <a name="C38V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:29</font></a> The brass of the offering was
seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels.  <a name="C38V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:30</font></a> With this he made the sockets to
the door of the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating for
it, all the vessels of the altar,  <a name="C38V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:31</font></a> the sockets around the court,
the sockets of the gate of the court, all the pins of the tent, and all
the pins around the court.
<p> <a name="C39V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:1</font></a> Of the blue, purple,
and scarlet, they made finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy
place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:2</font></a> He made the ephod of
gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  <a name="C39V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:3</font></a> They beat the gold into thin
plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, in the purple, in
the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.
 <a name="C39V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:4</font></a> They made shoulder straps
for it, joined together. At the two ends it was joined together.  <a name="C39V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:5</font></a> The skillfully woven band that
was on it, with which to fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its
work; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Yahweh
commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:6</font></a> They worked the onyx
stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a
signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.  <a name="C39V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:7</font></a> He put them on the shoulder
straps of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel,
as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:8</font></a> He made the
breastplate, the work of a skillful workman, like the work of the ephod;
of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  <a name="C39V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:9</font></a> It was square. They made the
breastplate double. Its length was a span, and its breadth a span, being
double.  <a name="C39V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:10</font></a> They set in it
four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz, and beryl was the first row;
 <a name="C39V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:11</font></a> and the second row, a
turquoise, a <a href="#N19">sapphire</a>, and an emerald;  <a name="C39V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:12</font></a> and the third row, a jacinth, an
agate, and an amethyst;  <a name="C39V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:13</font></a> and the fourth row, a
chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold settings.
 <a name="C39V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:14</font></a> The stones were
according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to
their names; like the engravings of a signet, everyone according to his
name, for the twelve tribes.  <a name="C39V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:15</font></a> They made on the breastplate
chains like cords, of braided work of pure gold.  <a name="C39V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:16</font></a> They made two settings of gold,
and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the
breastplate.  <a name="C39V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:17</font></a> They put
the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the
breastplate.  <a name="C39V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:18</font></a> The other
two ends of the two braided chains they put on the two settings, and put
them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, in its front.  <a name="C39V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:19</font></a> They made two rings of gold, and
put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its edge, which was toward
the side of the ephod inward.  <a name="C39V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:20</font></a> They made two rings of gold, and
put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod underneath, in its front,
close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
 <a name="C39V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:21</font></a> They bound the
breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue,
that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the
breastplate might not come loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:22</font></a> He made the robe of
the ephod of woven work, all of blue.  <a name="C39V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:23</font></a> The opening of the robe in its
midst was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its
opening, that it should not be torn.  <a name="C39V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:24</font></a> They made on the skirts of the
robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen.  <a name="C39V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:25</font></a> They made bells of pure gold,
and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe,
between the pomegranates;  <a name="C39V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:26</font></a> a bell and a pomegranate, a bell
and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as
Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:27</font></a> They made the coats
of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,  <a name="C39V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:28</font></a> and the turban of fine linen,
and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine
twined linen,  <a name="C39V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:29</font></a> and the
sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of
the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:30</font></a> They made the plate
of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the
engravings of a signet: &quot;HOLY TO YAHWEH.&quot;  <a name="C39V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:31</font></a> They tied to it a lace of blue,
to fasten it on the turban above, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C39V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:32</font></a> Thus all the work of
the tent of the Tent of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did
according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did.  <a name="C39V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:33</font></a> They brought the tent to Moses,
the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its
pillars, its sockets,  <a name="C39V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:34</font></a> the covering of rams' skins dyed
red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen,  <a name="C39V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:35</font></a> the ark of the testimony with
its poles, the mercy seat,  <a name="C39V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:36</font></a> the table, all its vessels, the
show bread,  <a name="C39V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:37</font></a> the pure
lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, all its vessels,
the oil for the light,  <a name="C39V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:38</font></a> the golden altar, the anointing
oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door of the Tent,  <a name="C39V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:39</font></a> the bronze altar, its grating of
brass, its poles, all of its vessels, the basin and its base,  <a name="C39V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:40</font></a> the hangings of the court, its
pillars, its sockets, the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, its
pins, all the instruments of the service of the tent, for the Tent of
Meeting,  <a name="C39V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:41</font></a> the finely
worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for
Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
priest's office.  <a name="C39V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:42</font></a> According to all that Yahweh
commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.  <a name="C39V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:43</font></a> Moses saw all the work, and
behold, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done
it: and Moses blessed them.
<p> <a name="C40V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C40V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:2</font></a> &quot;On the
first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent of the Tent of
Meeting.  <a name="C40V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:3</font></a> You shall put

shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tent of the
Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C40V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:7</font></a> You
shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall
put water therein.  <a name="C40V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:8</font></a> You
shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of
the court.  <a name="C40V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:9</font></a> You shall take
the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all that is in it, and shall
make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy.  <a name="C40V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:10</font></a> You shall anoint the altar of
burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the
altar will be most holy.  <a name="C40V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:11</font></a> You shall anoint the basin and
its base, and sanctify it.  <a name="C40V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:12</font></a> You shall bring Aaron and his
sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water.
 <a name="C40V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:13</font></a> You shall put on Aaron
the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may
minister to me in the priest's office.  <a name="C40V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:14</font></a> You shall bring his sons, and
put coats on them.  <a name="C40V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:15</font></a> You
shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to
me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an
everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.&quot;  <a name="C40V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:16</font></a> Moses did so. According to all
that Yahweh commanded him, so he did.
<p> <a name="C40V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:17</font></a> It happened in the
first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the
tent was raised up.  <a name="C40V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:18</font></a> Moses raised up the tent, and
laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised
up its pillars.  <a name="C40V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:19</font></a> He
spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tent above on
it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:20</font></a> He took and put the testimony
into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above
on the ark.  <a name="C40V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:21</font></a> He brought
the ark into the tent, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the
ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:22</font></a> He put the table in the Tent of
Meeting, on the side of the tent northward, outside of the veil.  <a name="C40V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:23</font></a> He set the bread in order on it
before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:24</font></a> He put the lampstand in the Tent
of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tent southward.  <a name="C40V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:25</font></a> He lit the lamps before Yahweh,
as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:26</font></a> He put the golden altar in the
Tent of Meeting before the veil;  <a name="C40V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:27</font></a> and he burnt incense of sweet
spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:28</font></a> He put up the screen of the door
to the tent.  <a name="C40V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:29</font></a> He set the
altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent of the Tent of Meeting,
and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh
commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:30</font></a> He set
the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water
therein, with which to wash.  <a name="C40V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:31</font></a> Moses, Aaron, and his sons
washed their hands and their feet there.  <a name="C40V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:32</font></a> When they went into the Tent of
Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh
commanded Moses.  <a name="C40V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:33</font></a> He
raised up the court around the tent and the altar, and set up the screen
of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
<p> <a name="C40V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:34</font></a> Then the cloud
covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tent.
 <a name="C40V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:35</font></a> Moses wasn't able to
enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and
Yahweh's glory filled the tent.  <a name="C40V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:36</font></a> When the cloud was taken up from
over the tent, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their
journeys;  <a name="C40V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:37</font></a> but if the
cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was
taken up.  <a name="C40V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:38</font></a> For the cloud
of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire in the cloud by
night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their
journeys.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Exodus ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web0210h.htm or web0210h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web0211h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web0210ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>

that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>
