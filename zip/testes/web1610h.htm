<h1>
Nehemiah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The words of Nehemiah the
son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth
year, as I was in Shushan the palace,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> that Hanani, one of my brothers,
came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the
Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning
Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> They said to
me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in
great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down,
and its gates are burned with fire.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> It happened, when I heard these
words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted
and prayed before the God of heaven,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> and said, I beg you, Yahweh, the
God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving
kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Let your ear now be attentive, and
your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I
pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel
your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we
have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house have sinned:  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> we have dealt very corruptly
against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the
ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Remember, I beg you, the word that
you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you trespass, I will scatter
you abroad among the peoples:  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> but if you return to me, and keep
my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost
part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring
them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.
 <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Now these are your
servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and
by your strong hand.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Lord, I beg you, let now your ear
be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your
servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant
this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cup
bearer to the king.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> It happened in the
month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was
before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had
not been <I>before</I> sad in his presence.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The king said to me, Why is your
face sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
heart. Then I was very sore afraid.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> I said to the king, Let the king
live forever: why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of
my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
 <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Then the king said to me,
For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> I said to the king, If it please
the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you
would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may build
it.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The king said to me
(the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall your journey be? and
when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a
time.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Moreover I said to
the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors
beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;
 <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> and a letter to Asaph the
keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for
the gates of the castle which appertains to the house, and for the wall of
the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. The king granted me,
according to the good hand of my God on me.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Then I came to the governors
beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent
with me captains of the army and horsemen.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> When Sanballat the Horonite, and
Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them
exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of
Israel.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> So I came to
Jerusalem, and was there three days.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> I arose in the night, I and some
few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to
do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal
that I rode on.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> I went
out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the
dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and
its gates were consumed with fire.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Then I went on to the spring gate
and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the animal that was
under me to pass.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Then
went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned
back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> The rulers didn't know where I
went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the
priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the
work.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Then said I to
them, You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and
its gates are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of
Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> I told them of the hand of my God
which was good on me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to
me. They said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands
for the good <I>work</I>.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> But when Sanballat the Horonite,
and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it,
they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you
do? will you rebel against the king?  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Then answered I them, and said to
them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants
will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
Jerusalem.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Then Eliashib the high
priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep
gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors; even to the tower of
Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Next to him built the men of
Jericho. Next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> The fish gate did the sons of
Hassenaah build; they laid its beams, and set up its doors, its bolts, and
its bars.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Next to them
repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. Next to them
repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. Next to
them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Next to them the Tekoites
repaired; but their nobles didn't put their necks to the work of their
lord.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> The old gate
repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they
laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Next to them repaired Melatiah the
Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah,
<I>that appertained</I> to the throne of the governor beyond the River.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Next to him repaired
Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. Next to him repaired Hananiah one
of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Next to them repaired
Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem.
 <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Next to them repaired
Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. Next to him repaired
Hattush the son of Hashabneiah.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Malchijah the son of Harim, and
Hasshub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired another portion, and the tower of
the furnaces.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Next to him
repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of
Jerusalem, he and his daughters.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> The valley gate repaired Hanun,
and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up its doors, its
bolts, and its bars, and one thousand cubits of the wall to the dung gate.
 <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> The dung gate repaired
Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem;
he built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> The spring gate repaired Shallun
the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and
covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and the wall of
the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even to the stairs that go down
from the city of David.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> After him repaired Nehemiah the
son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, to the place
over against the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the
house of the mighty men.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> After him repaired the Levites,
Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half
the district of Keilah, for his district.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> After him repaired their
brothers, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of
Keilah.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Next to him
repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion,
over against the ascent to the armory at the turning <I>of the wall</I>.
 <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> After him Baruch the son
of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning <I>of the
wall</I> to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> After him repaired Meremoth the
son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house
of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> After him repaired the priests,
the men of the Plain.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> After them repaired Benjamin and
Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of
Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> After him repaired Binnui the son
of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah to the turning <I>of
the wall</I>, and to the corner.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Palal the son of Uzai
<I>repaired</I> over against the turning <I>of the wall</I>, and the tower
that stands out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of
the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh <I>repaired</I>.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> (Now the Nethinim lived in Ophel,
to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower
that stands out.)  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> After
him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower
that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> Above the horse gate repaired the
priests, everyone over against his own house.  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> After them repaired Zadok the son
of Immer over against his own house. After him repaired Shemaiah the son
of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate.  <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> After him repaired Hananiah the
son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion.
After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his
chamber.  <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> After him
repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths to the house of the Nethinim, and
of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent
of the corner.  <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> Between
the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and
the merchants.
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> But it happened that
when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and
took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> He spoke before his brothers and
the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they
fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day?
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are
burned?  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Now Tobiah the
Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a
fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Hear, our God; for we are
despised: and turn back their reproach on their own head, and give them up
for a spoil in a land of captivity;  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> and don't cover their iniquity,
and don't let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have
provoked <I>you</I> to anger before the builders.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> So we built the wall; and all the
wall was joined together to half <I>the height</I> of it: for the people
had a mind to work.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But it
happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the
Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went
forward, <I>and</I> that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were
very angry;  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> and they
conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to
cause confusion therein.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> But we made our prayer to our God,
and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Judah said, The strength of the
bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are
not able to build the wall.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Our adversaries said, They shall
not know, neither see, until we come into the midst of them, and kill
them, and cause the work to cease.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> It happened that when the Jews
who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, You
must return to us.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Therefore set I in the lowest
parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set <I>there</I>
the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their
bows.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> I looked, and rose
up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the
people, Don't be you afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and
awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your
wives, and your houses.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> It happened, when our enemies
heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to
nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone to his work.
 <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> It happened from that
time forth, that half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them
held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the
rulers were behind all the house of Judah.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> They all built the wall and those
who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked
in the work, and with the other held his weapon;  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> and the builders, everyone had
his sword girded by his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was
by me.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> I said to the
nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great
and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another:  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> in whatever place you hear the
sound of the trumpet, resort you there to us; our God will fight for us.
 <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> So we worked in the work:
and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the
stars appeared.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Likewise
at the same time said I to the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge
within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may
labor in the day.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> So
neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who
followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone <I>went with</I> his
weapon <I>to</I> the water.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Then there arose a
great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the
Jews.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> For there were that
said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we
may eat and live.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Some
also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our
vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.
 <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> There were also that said,
We have borrowed money for the king's tribute <I>on</I> our fields and our
vineyards.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Yet now our
flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and
behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants,
and some of our daughters are brought into bondage <I>already</I>: neither
is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our
vineyards.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> I was very
angry when I heard their cry and these words.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Then I consulted with myself, and
contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact
usury, everyone of his brother. I held a great assembly against them.
 <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> I said to them, We after
our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, that were sold to the
nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to
us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Also I said, The thing that you do
is not good: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the
reproach of the nations our enemies?  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> I likewise, my brothers and my
servants, do lend them money and grain. Please let us leave off this
usury.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Please restore to
them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves,
and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain,
the new wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Then said they, We will restore
them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say.
Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do
according to this promise.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Also I shook out my lap, and
said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that
doesn't perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. All
the assembly said, Amen, and praised Yahweh. The people did according to
this promise.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Moreover
from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of
Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, <I>that is</I>, twelve years, I and my brothers have
not eaten the bread of the governor.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> But the former governors who were
before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them,
besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the
people: but I didn't do so, because of the fear of God.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Yes, also I continued in the work
of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were
gathered there to the work.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Moreover there were at my table,
of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came
to us from among the nations that were around us.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Now that which was prepared for
one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me,
and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I didn't
demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this
people.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Remember to me,
my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
<p>  <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Now it happened, when
it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to
the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no
breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors
in the gates;)  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> that
Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in
<I>one of</I> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me
mischief.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> I sent
messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can't come
down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> They sent to me four times
after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Then sent Sanballat his servant to
me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> in which was written, It is
reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews
think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you would
be their king, according to these words.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> You have also appointed prophets
to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now
shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
therefore, and let us take counsel together.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Then I sent to him, saying, There
are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own
heart.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> For they all would
have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work,
that it not be done. But now, <I>God</I>, strengthen you my hands.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> I went to the house of Shemaiah
the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let
us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut
the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night
will they come to kill you.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> I said, Should such a man as I
flee? and who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to
save his life? I will not go in.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> I discerned, and behold, God had
not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and
Sanballat had hired him.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> For this cause was he hired, that
I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter
for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Remember, my God, Tobiah and
Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah,
and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> So the wall was finished in the
twenty-fifth <I>day</I> of <I>the month</I> Elul, in fifty-two days.
 <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> It happened, when all our
enemies heard <I>of it</I>, that all the nations that were about us
feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that
this work was worked of our God.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> Moreover in those days the nobles
of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and <I>the letters</I> of Tobiah
came to them.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> For there
were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of
Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of
Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Also they spoke of his good deeds
before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in
fear.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Now it happened, when
the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the
singers and the Levites were appointed,  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> that I put my brother Hanani, and
Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a
faithful man, and feared God above many.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> I said to them, Don't let the
gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand
<I>on guard</I>, let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint
watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and
everyone <I>to be</I> over against his house.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Now the city was wide and large;
but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> My God put into my heart to gather
together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be
reckoned by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came
up at the first, and I found written therein:  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> These are the children of the
province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried
away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who
returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city;  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua,
Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth,
Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
 <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> The children of Parosh,
two thousand one hundred seventy-two.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> The children of Shephatiah, three

and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety-two.
 <a name="C7V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:61</font></a> These were those who went
up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could
not show their fathers' houses, nor their seed, whether they were of
Israel:  <a name="C7V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:62</font></a> The children of
Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred
forty-two.  <a name="C7V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:63</font></a> Of the
priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of
Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite,
and was called after their name.  <a name="C7V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:64</font></a> These sought their register
<I>among</I> those who were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found:
therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.  <a name="C7V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:65</font></a> The governor said to them, that
they should not eat of the most holy things, until there stood up a priest
with Urim and Thummim.  <a name="C7V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:66</font></a> The whole assembly together was
forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,  <a name="C7V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:67</font></a> besides their male servants and
their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred
thirty-seven: and they had two hundred forty-five singing men and singing
women.  <a name="C7V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:68</font></a> Their horses were
seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;  <a name="C7V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:69</font></a> <I>their</I> camels, four hundred
thirty-five; <I>their</I> donkeys, six thousand seven hundred twenty.
 <a name="C7V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:70</font></a> Some from among the heads
of fathers' <I>houses</I> gave to the work. The governor gave to the
treasury one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred
thirty priests' garments.  <a name="C7V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:71</font></a> Some of the heads of fathers'
<I>houses</I> gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of
gold, and two thousand two hundred minas of silver.  <a name="C7V72"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:72</font></a> That which the rest of the people
gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand minas of silver,
and sixty-seven priests' garments.  <a name="C7V73"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:73</font></a> So the priests, and the Levites,
and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the
Nethinim, and all Israel, lived in their cities. When the seventh month
was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> All the people
gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was
before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book
of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Ezra the priest brought the law
before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with
understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> He read therein before the broad
place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in
the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand;
and the ears of all the people were <I>attentive</I> to the book of the
law.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Ezra the scribe stood
on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him
stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and
Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, <I>and</I>
Meshullam.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Ezra opened the
book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;)
and when he opened it, all the people stood up:  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> and Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great
God. All the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their
hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh with their faces
to the ground.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Also
Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah,
Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites,
caused the people to understand the law: and the people <I>stood</I> in
their place.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> They read in
the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that
they understood the reading.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Nehemiah, who was the governor,
and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people,
said to all the people, This day is holy to Yahweh your God; don't mourn,
nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
 <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Then he said to them, Go
your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for
whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Don't be
grieved; for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> So the Levites stilled all the
people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be you
grieved.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> All the people
went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make
great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to
them.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> On the second day
were gathered together the heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> of all the
people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give
attention to the words of the law.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> They found written in the law,
how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should
dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> and that they should publish and
proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the
mountain, and get olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle
branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths,
as it is written.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> So the
people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone
on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the
house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad
place of the gate of Ephraim.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> All the assembly of those who
were come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths;
for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of
Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Also day by day, from the first
day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the
feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
to the ordinance.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Now in the
twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with
fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth on them.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> The seed of Israel separated
themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and
the iniquities of their fathers.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> They stood up in their place, and
read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day;
and <I>another</I> fourth part they confessed, and worshiped Yahweh their
God.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Then stood up on the
stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni,
Sherebiah, Bani, <I>and</I> Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh
their God.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Then the
Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah,
Shebaniah, <I>and</I> Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Yahweh your God
from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be your glorious name, which
is exalted above all blessing and praise.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> You are Yahweh, even you alone;
you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the
earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them,
and you preserve them all; and the army of heaven worships you.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> You are Yahweh the God, who did
choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave
him the name of Abraham,  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> and found his heart faithful
before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the
Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite,
and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words;
for you are righteous.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> You
saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the <a
href="#N1">Red Sea</a>,  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> and showed signs and wonders on
Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for
you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and did get you a name, as
it is this day.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> You
divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the
sea on the dry land; and their pursuers you did cast into the depths, as a
stone into the mighty waters.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Moreover in a pillar of cloud you
led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in
the way in which they should go.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> You came down also on Mount
Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and
true laws, good statutes and commandments,  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> and made known to them your holy
Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by
Moses your servant,  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> and
gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for
them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded those who they should
go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> But they and our fathers dealt
proudly and hardened their neck, and didn't listen to your commandments,
 <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> and refused to obey,
neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened
their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their
bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn't forsake them.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> Yes, when they had made them a
molten calf, and said, This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,
and had committed awful blasphemies;  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> yet you in your manifold mercies
didn't forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn't depart
from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire
by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> You gave also your good Spirit to
instruct them, and didn't withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave
them water for their thirst.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Yes, forty years did you sustain
them in the wilderness, <I>and</I> they lacked nothing; their clothes
didn't grow old, and their feet didn't swell.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Moreover you gave them kingdoms
and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed
the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of
Og king of Bashan.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Their
children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky, and brought them
into the land concerning which you did say to their fathers, that they
should go in to possess it.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> So the children went in and
possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the
land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings,
and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
 <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> They took fortified
cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things,
cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in
abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted
themselves in your great goodness.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> Nevertheless they were
disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their
back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them
again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> Therefore you delivered them into
the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of
their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and
according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them
out of the hand of their adversaries.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> But after they had rest, they did
evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their
enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times did you deliver
them according to your mercies,  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> and testified against them, that
you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn't
listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if
a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened
their neck, and would not hear.  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> Yet many years did you bear with
them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet
would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the
peoples of the lands.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> Nevertheless in your manifold
mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are
a gracious and merciful God.  <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> Now therefore, our God, the
great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keep covenant and loving
kindness, don't let all the travail seem little before you, that has come
on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of
the kings of Assyria to this day.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> However you are just in all that
is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;
 <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> neither have our kings,
our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to
your commandments and your testimonies with which you did testify against
them.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> For they have not
served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave
them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither
turned they from their wicked works.  <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> Behold, we are servants this day,
and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its
good, behold, we are servants in it.  <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> It yields much increase to the
kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power
over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in
great distress.  <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> Yet for
all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our
Levites, <I>and</I> our priests, seal to it.
<p>
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now those who sealed
were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
 <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Pashhur, Amariah,

son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> and their brothers, Shebaniah,

Harim, Baanah.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> The rest
of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the
Nethinim, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of
the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters,
everyone who had knowledge, and understanding;  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> They joined with their brothers,
their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's
law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do
all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his ordinances and his
statutes;  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> and that we
would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their
daughters for our sons;  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> and if the peoples of the land
bring wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy
of them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the
seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> Also we made ordinances for us,
to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service
of the house of our God;  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> for the show bread, and for the
continual meal offering, and for the continual burnt offering, for the
Sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things,
and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the
work of the house of our God.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> We cast lots, the priests, the
Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house
of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by
year, to burn on the altar of Yahweh our God, as it is written in the law;
 <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> and to bring the first
fruits of our ground, and the first fruits of all fruit of all manner of
trees, year by year, to the house of Yahweh;  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> also the firstborn of our sons,
and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, and the firstborn of
our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, to the
priests who minister in the house of our God;  <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> and that we should bring the
first fruits of our dough, and our wave offerings, and the fruit of all
manner of trees, the new wine and the oil, to the priests, to the chambers
of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites; for
they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
 <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> The priest the son of
Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the
Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to
the chambers, into the treasure house.  <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> For the children of Israel and
the children of Levi shall bring the wave offering of the grain, of the
new wine, and of the oil, to the chambers, where are the vessels of the
sanctuary, and the priests who minister, and the porters, and the singers:
and we will not forsake the house of our God.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> The princes of the
people lived in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring
one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the
<I>other</I> cities.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> The
people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in
Jerusalem.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> Now these are
the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem: but in the cities of
Judah lived everyone in his possession in their cities, <I>to wit</I>,
Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children
of Solomon's servants.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> In
Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of
Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of
Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of
Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> and Maaseiah the son of Baruch,
the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of
Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> All the sons of Perez who lived
in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty-eight valiant men.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> These are the sons of Benjamin:
Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son
of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
 <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> After him Gabbai, Sallai,
nine hundred twenty-eight.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Joel the son of Zichri was their
overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Of the priests: Jedaiah the son
of Joiarib, Jachin,  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the
son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of
Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God,  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> and their brothers who did the
work of the house, eight hundred twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of
Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the
son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> and his brothers, chiefs of
fathers' <I>houses</I>, two hundred forty-two; and Amashsai the son of
Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
 <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> and their brothers,
mighty men of valor, one hundred twenty-eight; and their overseer was
Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son
of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
 <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> and Shabbethai and
Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the
outward business of the house of God;  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> and Mattaniah the son of Mica,
the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the
thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brothers; and
Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> All the Levites in the holy city
were two hundred eighty-four.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> Moreover the porters, Akkub,
Talmon, and their brothers, who kept watch at the gates, were one hundred
seventy-two.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> The residue
of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah,
everyone in his inheritance.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> But the Nethinim lived in Ophel:
and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> The overseer also of the Levites
at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the
business of the house of God.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> For there was a commandment from
the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as
every day required.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel,
of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all
matters concerning the people.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> As for the villages, with their
fields, some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns,
and in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> and in Jeshua, and in Moladah,
and Beth Pelet,  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> and in
Hazar Shual, and in Beersheba and its towns,  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> and in Ziklag, and in Meconah
and in its towns,  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> and in
En Rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth,  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Zanoah, Adullam, and their
villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped
from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> The children of Benjamin also
<I>lived</I> from Geba <I>onward</I>, at Michmash and Aija, and at Bethel
and its towns,  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> at
Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,  <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> Lod, and Ono, the valley of
craftsmen.  <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> Of the
Levites, certain divisions in Judah <I>were joined</I> to Benjamin.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now these are the
priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Shecaniah, Rehum,

 <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah,
Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the
days of Jeshua.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> Moreover
the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, <I>and</I>
Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their
brothers, were over against them according to their offices.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Jeshua became the father of
Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became
the father of Joiada,  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> and Joiada became the father of
Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> In the days of Joiakim were
priests, heads of fathers' <I>houses</I>: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of
Jeremiah, Hananiah;  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> of
Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> of Malluchi, Jonathan; of

Eber;  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> of Hilkiah,
Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> As for the Levites, in the days
of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the
heads of fathers' <I>houses</I>; also the priests, in the reign of Darius
the Persian.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> The sons of
Levi, heads of fathers' <I>houses</I>, were written in the book of the
chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> The chiefs of the Levites:
Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers
over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment
of David the man of God, watch next to watch.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah,
Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the
storehouses of the gates.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> These were in the days of
Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah
the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> At the dedication of the wall of
Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them
to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving
thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with
harps.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> The sons of the
singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around
Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> also from Beth Gilgal, and out
of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them
villages around Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> The priests and the Levites
purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the
wall.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> Then I brought up
the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who
gave thanks and went in procession. <I>One went</I> on the right hand on
the wall toward the dung gate;  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> and after them went Hoshaiah,
and half of the princes of Judah,  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> and Azariah, Ezra, and
Meshullam,  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> Judah, and
Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,  <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> and certain of the priests' sons
with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son
of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
 <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> and his brothers,
Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani,
with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe
was before them.  <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> By the
spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the
city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even
to the water gate eastward.  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> The other company of those who
gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the
people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad
wall,  <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> and above the gate
of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of
Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood
still in the gate of the guard.  <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> So stood the two companies of
those who gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the
rulers with me;  <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> and the
priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and
Hananiah, with trumpets;  <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and
Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The
singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.  <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> They offered great sacrifices
that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and
the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was
heard even afar off.  <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> On
that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the
wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into
them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the
law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and
for the Levites who waited.  <a name="C12V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:45</font></a> They performed the duty of their
God, and the duty of the purification, and <I>so did</I> the singers and
the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his
son.  <a name="C12V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:46</font></a> For in the days of
David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of
praise and thanksgiving to God.  <a name="C12V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:47</font></a> All Israel in the days of
Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers
and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart <I>that which
was</I> for the Levites; and the Levites set apart <I>that which was</I>
for the sons of Aaron.
<p>
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> On that day they read
in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found
written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly
of God forever,  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> because
they didn't meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but
hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse
into a blessing.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> It came
to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all
the mixed multitude.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Now
before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of
the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> had prepared for him a great
chamber, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and
the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which
were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the
porters; and the wave offerings for the priests.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> But in all this <I>time</I> I was
not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of
Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the
king,  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> and I came to
Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> It grieved me sore: therefore I
cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Then I commanded, and they
cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house
of God, with the meal offerings and the frankincense.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> I perceived that the portions of
the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers,
who did the work, had fled everyone to his field.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Then contended I with the
rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? I gathered them
together, and set them in their place.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Then brought all Judah the tithe
of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> I made treasurers over the
treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the
Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to
distribute to their brothers.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> Remember me, my God, concerning
this, and don't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of
my God, and for its observances.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> In those days saw I in Judah
some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and
loading donkeys <I>therewith</I>; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all
manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day:
and I testified <I>against them</I> in the day in which they sold food.
 <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> There lived men of Tyre
also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on
the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Then I contended with the nobles
of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and
profane the Sabbath day?  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Didn't your fathers do thus, and
did not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring
more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> It came to pass that, when the
gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that
the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened
until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no
burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> So the merchants and sellers of
all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> Then I testified against them,
and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will
lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.
 <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> I commanded the Levites
that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the
gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and
spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> In those days also saw I the
Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, <I>and</I> of Moab:
 <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> and their children spoke
half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language,
but according to the language of each people.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> I contended with them, and
cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and
made them swear by God, <I>saying</I>, You shall not give your daughters
to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
 <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Did not Solomon king of
Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like
him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:
nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> Shall we then listen to you to
do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign
women?  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> One of the sons
of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to
Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> Remember them, my God, because
they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and
of the Levites.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Thus
cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests
and for the Levites, everyone in his work;  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> and for the wood offering, at
times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
