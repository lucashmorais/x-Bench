Files and Directories
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="1599"></A><A NAME="1600"></A><A NAME="1601"></A><A NAME="1602"></A><A NAME="1603"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Files</SPAN> are a facility for storing and organizing information, analogous
to paper documents. They're organized into <SPAN  CLASS="textit">directories</SPAN>, which are called
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">folders</SPAN> on some other systems. Let's look at the organization of files
on a Debian system: 

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>/.</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>A simple <TT>/</TT> represents the root directory. All other files
and directories are contained in the root directory. If you are coming from
the DOS/Windows world, <TT>/</TT> is very similar to what <TT>C:</TT>is for
DOS, that is the root of the filesystem. A notable difference between DOS and
Linux however, is that DOS keeps several filesystems: <TT>C:</TT> (first hard
disk), <TT>A:</TT> (first floppy disk), and <TT>D:</TT> (either CD-ROM or second
hard disk), whereas Linux has all its files organized above the same <TT>/</TT>
root.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>/home/janeq.</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the home directory of user ``janeq.'' Reading
left to right, to get to this directory you start in the root directory, enter
directory <TT>home</TT>, and then enter directory <TT>janeq</TT>. 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>/etc/X11/XF86Config.</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the configuration file for the X Window
system. It resides in the <TT>X11</TT> subdirectory of the <TT>/etc</TT> directory.
<TT>/etc</TT> is in turn a subdirectory of the root directory, <TT>/</TT>. 
</DD>
</DL>
Things to note: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Filenames are case-sensitive. That is, <TT>MYFILE</TT> and <TT>MyFile</TT> are
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">different</SPAN> files. 
</LI>
<LI>The root directory is referred to as simply <TT>/</TT>. Don't confuse this ``root''<A NAME="1630"></A><A NAME="1631"></A><A NAME="1632"></A><A NAME="1633"></A><A NAME="1634"></A>
with the root user, the user on your system with ``super powers.'' 
</LI>
<LI>Every directory has a name, which can contain any letters or symbols <SPAN  CLASS="textit">except</SPAN>
<TT>/</TT>. The root directory is an exception; its name is <TT>/</TT> (pronounced
``slash'' or ``the root directory''), and it cannot be renamed. 
</LI>
<LI>While you <SPAN  CLASS="textit">can</SPAN> use almost any letters or symbols in a filename, in practice
it's a bad idea. It is better to avoid characters that often have special meanings
on the command line, including: <TT>{ } ( ) [ ] ' `
&#34; &#92;/
&gt; &lt; | ; ! # &amp; ^ * %</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Also avoid putting spaces in filenames. If you want to separate words in a name,
good choices are the period, hyphen, and underscore. You could also capitalize
each word, <TT>LikeThis</TT>. 
</LI>
<LI>Each file or directory is designated by a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fully-qualified filename</SPAN>,<A NAME="1647"></A><A NAME="1648"></A>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">absolute filename</SPAN>, or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN>, giving the sequence of directories
which must be passed through to reach it. The three terms are synonymous. All
absolute filenames begin with the <TT>/</TT> directory, and there's a <TT>/</TT>
before each directory or file in the filename. The first <TT>/</TT> is the name
of a directory, but the others are simply separators to distinguish the parts
of the filename. 
</LI>
<LI>The words used here can be confusing. Take the following example: <A NAME="1654"></A><A NAME="1655"></A><TT>/usr/share/keytables/us.map.gz</TT>.
This is a fully-qualified filename; some people call it a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN>. However,
people will also refer to <TT>us.map.gz</TT> alone as a filename. 
</LI>
<LI>There is also another use for the word ``path.'' The intended meaning is usually
clear from the context. 
</LI>
<LI>Directories are arranged in a tree structure. All absolute filenames start with
the root directory. The root directory has a number of branches, such as <TT>/etc</TT>
and <TT>/usr</TT>. These subdirectories in turn branch into still more subdirectories,
such as <TT>/etc/init.d</TT> and <TT>/usr/local</TT>. The whole thing together
is called the ``directory tree.'' 
</LI>
<LI>You can think of an absolute filename as a route from the base of the tree (<TT>/</TT>)
to the end of some branch (a file). You'll also hear people talk about the directory
tree as if it were a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">family</SPAN> tree: Thus subdirectories have ``parent,''
and a path shows the complete ancestry of a file. 
</LI>
<LI>There are also relative paths that begin somewhere other than the root directory.
More on this later. 
</LI>
<LI>No directory corresponds to a physical device, such as your hard disk. This
differs from DOS and Windows, in which all paths begin with a device name such
as <TT>C:&#92;</TT>. <A NAME="1666"></A><A NAME="1667"></A><A NAME="1668"></A>The directory tree is meant to be an abstraction
of the physical hardware, so you can use the system without knowing what the
hardware is. All your files could be on one disk - or you could have 20 disks,
some of them connected to a different computer elsewhere on the network. You
can't tell just by looking at the directory tree, and nearly all commands work
just the same way no matter what physical device(s) your files are really on. 
</LI>
</UL>
Don't worry if all this isn't completely clear yet. There are many examples
to come. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04521000000000000000">
Using Files: A Tutorial </A>
</H2>

<P>
To use your system, you'll have to know how to create, move, rename, and delete
files and directories. This section describes how to do so with the standard
Debian commands. 

<P>
The best way to learn is to try things. As long as you aren't root (and haven't
yet created any important personal files), you cannot mess up too seriously.
Jump in - type each of these commands at the prompt and press <TT>Enter</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>pwd<A NAME="1673"></A>
</DD>
</DL>One directory is always considered the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">current working directory<A NAME="1675"></A></SPAN>
<A NAME="1676"></A><A NAME="1677"></A><A NAME="1678"></A><A NAME="1679"></A><A NAME="1680"></A>for the shell you're using. You can view this directory with the <TT>pwd</TT>
command, which stands for Print Working Directory. <TT>pwd</TT> prints the name
of the directory you're working in - probably <TT>/home/yourname</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ls<A NAME="1685"></A>
</DD>
</DL><TT>ls</TT> stands for ``list,'' as in ``list files.'' When you type <TT>ls</TT>,
the system displays a list of all the files in your current working directory.
If you've just installed Debian, your home directory may well be empty. If your
working directory is empty, <TT>ls</TT> produces no output, because there are
no files to list. <A NAME="1690"></A><A NAME="1691"></A>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;/<A NAME="1693"></A>
</DD>
</DL><A NAME="1695"></A><A NAME="1696"></A>
<TT>cd</TT> means ``change directory<A NAME="5351"></A>.'' In
this case, you've asked to change to the root directory. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>pwd
</DD>
</DL><A NAME="1701"></A>
This verifies that you're working in the root directory. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ls
</DD>
</DL>Lets you see what's in <TT>/</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD><A NAME="1706"></A><A NAME="1707"></A><A NAME="1708"></A><A NAME="1709"></A>
cd
</DD>
</DL>Typing <TT>cd</TT> with no arguments selects your home directory -
<TT>/home/ yourname</TT>
- as the current working directory. Try <TT>pwd</TT> to verify this. 

<P>
<A NAME="1714"></A><A NAME="1715"></A><A NAME="1716"></A>Before continuing, you should know that there are actually two different kinds
of filenames. Some of them begin with <TT>/</TT>, the root directory, such as
<TT>/etc/profile</TT>. These are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">absolute</SPAN> filenames because
they refer to the same file no matter what your current directory is. The other
kind of filename is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relative</SPAN>. 

<P>
Two directory names are used <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> in relative filenames: <TT>.</TT>
and <TT>..</TT>. The directory <TT>.</TT> refers to the current directory, and
<TT>..</TT> is the parent directory. These are ``shortcut'' directories. They
exist in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">every</SPAN> directory. Even the root directory has a parent directory<A NAME="1727"></A><A NAME="1728"></A>
- it's its own parent! 

<P>
So filenames that include <TT>.</TT> or <TT>..</TT> are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relative</SPAN>, because
their meaning depends on the current directory. If I'm in <TT>/usr/bin</TT>
and type <TT>../etc</TT>, I'm referring to <TT>/usr/etc</TT>. If I'm in <TT>/var</TT>
and type <TT>../etc</TT>, I'm referring to <TT>/etc</TT>. Note that a filename
without the root directory at the front implicitly has <TT>./</TT> at the front.
So you can type <TT>local/bin</TT>, or <TT>./local/bin</TT> and it means the
same thing. 

<P>
A final handy tip: The <A NAME="1741"></A><A NAME="1742"></A>tilde <TT>~</TT> is equivalent to your home directory.
So typing <TT>cd&nbsp;~</TT> is the same as typing <TT>cd</TT> with no arguments.
Also, you can type things like <TT>cd&nbsp;~/practice/mysubdirectory</TT> to change
to the directory <TT>/home/yourname/practice/mysubdirectory</TT>. In a similar
way, <TT>~myuser</TT> is equivalent to the home directory of the user ``myuser,''
which is probably something like <TT>/home/myuser</TT>; so
<TT>~myuser/docs/debian.ps</TT>
is equivalent to <TT>/home/myuser/doc/debian.ps</TT>. 

<P>
Here are some more file commands to try out, now that you know about relative
filenames. <TT>cd</TT> to your home directory before you begin. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>mkdir&nbsp;practice
</DD>
</DL>In your home directory, make a directory called <TT>practice</TT>. You'll use
this directory to try out some other commands. You might type <TT>ls</TT> to
verify that your new directory exists. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;practice
</DD>
</DL>Changes the directory to <TT>practice</TT>.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>mkdir&nbsp;mysubdirectory<A NAME="1761"></A><A NAME="1762"></A><A NAME="1763"></A><A NAME="1764"></A>
</DD>
</DL>Creates a subdirectory of <TT>practice</TT>.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cp&nbsp;/etc/profile&nbsp;.
</DD>
</DL><TT>cp</TT> is short for ``copy.'' <TT>/etc/profile</TT> is just a random
file on your system, don't worry about what it is for now. We've copied it to
<TT>.</TT> (recall that <TT>.</TT> just means ``the directory I'm in now,''
or the current working directory). So this creates a copy of <TT>/etc/profile</TT>
and puts it in your <TT>practice</TT> directory. Try typing <TT>ls</TT> to verify
that there's indeed a file called <TT>profile</TT> in your working directory,
alongside the new <TT>mysubdirectory</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>more&nbsp;profile<A NAME="1779"></A><A NAME="1780"></A><A NAME="1781"></A>
</DD>
</DL>This lets you view the contents of the file <TT>profile</TT>. <TT>more</TT>
is used to view the contents of text files. It's called <TT>more</TT> because
it shows one screenful of the file at a time, and you press the space bar to
see more. <TT>more</TT> will exit when you get to the end of the file, or when
you press <TT>q</TT> (quit). 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>more&nbsp;/etc/profile
</DD>
</DL>Verifies that the original looks just like the copy you made. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>mv&nbsp;profile&nbsp;mysubdirectory
</DD>
</DL><TT>mv</TT> stands for ``move.'' You've moved the file <TT>profile</TT> from
the current directory into the subdirectory you created earlier. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ls
</DD>
</DL>Verifies that <TT>profile</TT> is no longer in the current directory. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ls&nbsp;mysubdirectory
</DD>
</DL>Verifies that <TT>profile</TT> has moved to <TT>mysubdirectory</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;mysubdirectory
</DD>
</DL>Changes to the subdirectory. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD><A NAME="1804"></A><A NAME="1805"></A><A NAME="1806"></A>
mv&nbsp;profile&nbsp;myprofile
</DD>
</DL>Note that unlike some operating systems, there is no difference between moving
a file and renaming it. Thus there's no separate <TT>rename</TT> command. Note
that the second argument to <TT>mv</TT> can be a directory to move the file
or directory into, or it can be a new filename. <TT>cp</TT> works the same way. 

<P>
As usual, you can type <TT>ls</TT> to see the result of <TT>mv</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>mv&nbsp;myprofile&nbsp;..
</DD>
</DL>Just as <TT>.</TT> means ``the directory I'm in now,'' <TT>..</TT> means ``parent
of the current directory,'' in this case the <TT>practice</TT> directory you
created earlier. Use <TT>ls</TT> to verify that that's where <TT>myprofile</TT>
is now. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;..
</DD>
</DL>Changes directories to the parent directory - in this case <TT>practice</TT>,
where you just put <TT>myprofile</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>rm&nbsp;myprofile<A NAME="1825"></A><A NAME="1826"></A>
</DD>
</DL><TT>rm<A NAME="1828"></A><A NAME="5357"></A></TT> means ``remove,''
so this deletes <TT>myprofile</TT>.<A NAME="1831"></A><A NAME="1832"></A> Be careful! Deleting a file on a GNU/Linux
system is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">permanent</SPAN> - there is no undelete. If you <TT>rm</TT> it,
it's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gone</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">forever</SPAN>. Be careful! To repeat, deleting a file
on a GNU/Linux system is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">permanent</SPAN> - there is no undelete. If you
<TT>rm</TT> it, it's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gone</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">forever</SPAN>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>rmdir&nbsp;mysubdirectory<A NAME="1842"></A>
</DD>
</DL><TT>rmdir</TT> is just like <TT>rm</TT>, only it's for directories. Notice that
<TT>rmdir</TT> only works on empty directories. If the directory contains files,
you must delete those files first, or alternatively you can use <TT>rm&nbsp;-r</TT>
in place of <TT>rmdir</TT>. 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;..
</DD>
</DL>This moves out of the current directory, and into its parent directory. Now
you can type the following: 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>rmdir&nbsp;practice
</DD>
</DL>This will delete the last remnants of your practice session. 

<P>
So now you know how to create, copy, move, rename, and delete files and directories.
You also learned some shortcuts, like typing simply <TT>cd</TT> to jump to your
home directory, and how <TT>.</TT> and <TT>..</TT> refer to the current directory
and its parent, respectively. You should also remember the concept of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">root
directory</SPAN>, or <TT>/</TT>, and the alias <TT>~</TT> for your home directory. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04522000000000000000"></A><A NAME="1859"></A><A NAME="1860"></A>
<BR>
Dot Files and <TT>ls&nbsp;-a</TT>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="1861"></A><A NAME="1862"></A><A NAME="1863"></A><A NAME="1864"></A>When you type <TT>ls</TT>, files beginning with a dot are not listed. Traditionally,
files that contain configuration information, user preferences, and so on begin
with a dot; these are hidden and out of your way while you do your day-to-day
work. Sample dot files are <TT>~/.emacs</TT>, <TT>~/.newsrc</TT>, <TT>~/.bashrc</TT>,
<TT>~/.xsession</TT>, and <TT>~/.fvwmrc</TT>. These are used by Emacs,
news readers, the Bash shell, the X Window system, and the fvwm window manager,
respectively. It is conventional to end the dot filename with <TT>rc</TT>, but
some programs don't. There are also directories beginning with a dot, such as
<TT>~/.gimp</TT> and <TT>~/.netscape</TT>, which store preferences for
the Gimp and Netscape.

<P>
Sometimes a program will create a dot file automatically; for example, Netscape
allows you to edit your preferences with a graphical dialog box and then it
saves your choices. Other times you will create them yourself using a text editor;
this is the traditional way to do it, but you have to learn the peculiar format
of each file - inconvenient at first, but it can give you a lot of power.

<P>
To see dot files, you must use the <TT>-a</TT> option to <TT>ls</TT>. The long
form of <TT>-a</TT> is <TT>-all</TT>, if you find that easier to remember.
You can also use <TT>-A</TT> or <TT>-almost-all</TT>, which displays all
dot files except <TT>.</TT> and <TT>..</TT>. Remember that <TT>.</TT> is the
current directory, and <TT>..</TT> is the parent of the current directory; because
these are guaranteed to be in every directory, there is no real reason to list
them with <TT>ls</TT>. You already know they are there.
