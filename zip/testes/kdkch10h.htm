<H2>I</H2>
<P class=nh>[<I>A street. A few wayfarers, and a CITY GUARD</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> Ho, Sir! </P>
<P><B>City Guard.</B> What do you want? </P>
<P><B>Second Man.</B> Which way should we go? We are strangers here. Please tell 
us which street we should take. </P>
<P><B>City Guard.</B> Where do you want to go? </P><PB N="8"></PB>
<P><B>Third Man.</B> To where those big festivities are going to be held, you 
know. Which way do we go? </P>
<P><B>City Guard.</B> One street is quite as good as another here. Any street 
will lead you there. Go straight ahead, and you cannot miss the place. 
[<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> Just hear what the fool says: "Any street will lead you 
there!" Where, then, would be the sense of having so many streets? </P>
<P><B>Second Man.</B> You needn't be so awfully put out at that, my man. A 
country is free to arrange its affairs in its own way. <PB N="9"></PB>As for 
roads in our country--well, they are as good as non-existent; narrow and crooked 
lanes, a labyrinth of ruts and tracks. Our King does not believe in open 
thoroughfares; he thinks that streets are just so many openings for his subjects 
to fly away from his kingdom. It is quite the contrary here; nobody stands in 
your way, nobody objects to your going elsewhere if you like to; and yet the 
people are far from deserting this kingdom. With such streets our country would 
certainly have been depopulated in no time. </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> My dear Janardan, I have always noticed that this is a 
great fault in your character. </P>
<P><B>Janardan.</B> What is? </P><PB N="10"></PB>
<P><B>First Man.</B> That you are always having a fling at your country. How can 
you think that open highways may be good for a country? Look here, Kaundilya; 
here is a man who actually believes that open highways are the salvation of a 
country. </P>
<P><B>Kaundilya.</B> There is no need, Bhavadatta, of my pointing out afresh 
that Janardan is blessed with an intelligence which is remarkably crooked, which 
is sure to land him in danger some day. If the King comes to hear of our worthy 
friend, he will make it a pretty hard job for him to find any one to do him his 
funeral rites when he is dead. </P>
<P><B>Bhavadatta.</B> One can't help feeling that life becomes a burden in this 
country; one <PB N="11"></PB>misses the joys of privacy in these streets--this 
jostling and brushing shoulders with strange people day and night makes one long 
for a bath. And nobody can tell exactly what kind of people you are meeting with 
in these public roads--ugh! </P>
<P><B>Kaundilya.</B> And it is Janardan who persuaded us to come to this 
precious country! We never had any second person like him in our family. You 
knew my father, of course; he was a great man, a pious man if ever there was 
one. He spent his whole life within a circle of a radius of 49 cubits drawn with 
a rigid adherence to the injunctions of the scriptures, and never for a single 
day did he cross this circle. After his death a serious difficulty arose--how 
cremate him within the limits of the 49 cubits and yet outside <PB 
N="12"></PB>the house? At length the priests decided that though we could not go 
beyond the scriptural number, the only way out of the difficulty was to reverse 
the figure and make it 94 cubits; only thus could we cremate him outside the 
house without violating the sacred books. My word, that was strict observance! 
Ours is indeed no common country. </P>
<P><B>Bhavadatta.</B> And yet, though Janardan comes from the very same soil, he 
thinks it wise to declare that open highways are best for a country. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER with a band of boys</I>] </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Boys, we will have to vie with the wild breeze of the 
south to-day--and <PB N="13"></PB>we are not going to be beaten. We will sing 
till we have flooded all streets with our mirth and song. </P>
<P class=c><B>Song.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>The southern gate is unbarred. Come, my spring, come!<BR>Thou wilt 
swing at the swing of my heart, come, my spring, come!<BR>Come in the lisping 
leaves, in the youthful surrender of flowers;<BR>Come in the flute songs and the 
wistful sighs of the woodlands!<BR>Let your unfastened robe wildly flap in the 
drunken wind!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my spring, come! </I></P>
<P align=right>[<I>Exeunt.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a band of CITIZENS</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> After all, one cannot help wishing that the King had 
allowed himself to <PB N="14"></PB>be seen at least this one day. What a great 
pity, to live in his kingdom and yet not to have seen him for a single day! </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> If you only knew the real meaning of all this mystery! 
I could tell you if you would keep a secret. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> My dear fellow, we both live in the same quarter of the 
town, but have you ever known me letting out any man s secret? Of course, that 
matter of your brother's finding a hidden fortune while digging for a 
well--well, you know well enough why I had to give it out. You know all the 
facts. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Of course I know. And it is because I know that I ask, 
could you keep a <PB N="15"></PB>secret if I tell you? It may mean ruination to 
us all, you know, if you once let it out. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> You are a nice man, after all, Virupaksha! Why are you 
so anxious to bring down a disaster which as yet only may happen? Who will be 
responsible for keeping your secret all his life? </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> It is only because the topic came up--well, then, I shall 
not say anything. I am not the man to say things for nothing. You had yourself 
brought up the question that the King never showed himself; and I only remarked 
that it was not for nothing that the King shut himself up from the public gaze. 
</P><PB N="16"></PB>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Pray do tell us why, Virupaksha. </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> Of course I don't mind telling you--for we are all good 
friends, aren't we? There can be no harm. (With a low voice.) The 
King--is--hideous to look at, so he has made up his mind never to show himself 
to his subjects. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Ha! that's it! It must be so. We have always wondered . 
. . why, the mere sight of a King in all countries makes one's soul quake like 
an aspen leaf with fear; but why should our King never have been seen by any 
mortal soul? Even if he at least came out and consigned us all to the gibbet, we 
might be sure that our King was no hoax. After all, there is much in <PB 
N="17"></PB>Virupaksha's explanation that sounds plausible enough. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> Not a bit--I don't believe in a syllable of it. </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> What, Vishu, do you mean to say that I am a liar? </P>
<P><B>Vishu.</B> I don't exactly mean that--but I cannot accept your theory. 
Excuse me, I cannot help if I seem a bit rude or churlish. </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> Small wonder that you can't believe my words--you who 
think yourself sage enough to reject the opinions of your parents and superiors. 
How long do you think you could have <PB N="18"></PB>stayed in this country if 
the King did not remain in hiding? You are no better than a flagrant heretic. 
</P>
<P><B>Vishu.</B> My dear pillar of orthodoxy! Do you think any other King would 
have hesitated to cut off your tongue and make it food for dogs? And you have 
the face to say that our King is horrid to look at! </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> Look here, Vishu. will you curb your tongue? </P>
<P><B>Vishu.</B> It would be superfluous to point out whose tongue needs the 
curbing. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Hush, my dear friends--this looks rather bad. . . . It 
seems as if they <PB N="19"></PB>are resolved to put me in danger as well. I am 
not going to be a party to all this.[<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a number of men, dragging in GRANDFATHER, in boisterous 
exuberance</I>] </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Grandpa, something strikes me to-day . . . </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What is it? </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> This year every country has sent its people to our 
festival, but every one asks, "Everything is nice and beautiful--but where is 
your King?" and we do not know what to answer. That is the one big gap which 
cannot but make itself felt to every one in our country. </P><PB N="20"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> "Gap," do you say! Why, the whole country is all filled 
and crammed and packed with the King: and you call him a "gap"! Why,he has made 
every one of us a crowned King! </P>
<P align=center><B>Sings.</B> 
<P class=z><I>We are all Kings in the kingdom of our King.<BR>Were it not so, 
how could we hope in our heart to meet him!<BR>We do what we like, yet we do 
what he likes;<BR>We are not bound with the chain of fear at the feet of a 
slave-owning King.<BR>Were it not so, how could we hope in our heart to meet 
him!<BR>Our King honours each one of us, thus honours his own very self.<BR>No 
littleness can keep us shut up in its walls of untruth for aye.<BR><PB 
N="21"></PB>Were it not so, how could we have hope in our heart to meet 
him!<BR>We struggle and dig our own path, thus reach his path at the end.<BR>We 
can never get lost in the abyss of dark night.<BR>Were it not so, how could we 
hope in our heart to meet him! </I></P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> But, really, I cannot stand the absurd things people 
say about our King simply because he is not seen in public. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Just fancy! Any one libelling me can be punished, while 
nobody can stop the mouth of any rascal who chooses to slander the King. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> The slander cannot touch the King. <PB N="22"></PB>With a 
mere breath you can blow out the flame which a lamp inherits from the sun, but 
if all the world blow upon the sun itself its effulgence remains undimmed and 
unimpaired as before. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter VISHVAVASU and VIRUPAKSHA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Vishu.</B> Here's Grandfather! Look here, this man is going about telling 
everybody that our King does not come out because he is ugly. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But why does that make you angry, Vishu? His King must be 
ugly, because how else could Virupaksha possess such features in his kingdom? He 
fashions his King after the image of himself he sees in the mirror. </P><PB 
N="23"></PB>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> Grandfather, I shall mention no names, but nobody would 
think of disbelieving the person who gave me the news. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Who could be a higher authority than yourself! </P>
<P><B>Virupaksha.</B> But I could give you proofs . . . </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> The impudence of this fellow knows no bounds! Not 
content with spreading a ghastly rumour with an unabashed face, he offers to 
measure his lies with insolence! </P><PB N="24"></PB>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Why not make him measure his length on the ground? 
</P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Why so much heat, my friends? The poor fellow is going to 
have his own festive day by singing the ugliness of his King. Go along, 
Virupaksha, you will find plenty of people ready to believe you: may you be 
happy in their company.[<I>Exeunt.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Re-enter the party of FOREIGNERS</I>] </P>
<P><B>Bhavadatta.</B> It strikes me, Kaundilya, that these people haven't got a 
King at all. They have somehow managed to keep the rumour afloat. </P>
<P><B>Kaundilya.</B> You are right, I think. We all know that the supreme thing 
that strikes one's eye in any country is the King, who of course loses no 
opportunity of exhibiting himself. </P><PB N="25"></PB>
<P><B>Janardan.</B> But look at the nice order and regularity prevailing all 
over the place--how do you explain it without a King? </P>
<P><B>Bhavadatta.</B> So this is the wisdom you have arrived at by living so 
long under a ruler! Where would be the necessity of having a King if order and 
harmony existed already? </P>
<P><B>Janardan.</B> All these people have assembled to rejoice at this festival. 
Do you think they could come together like this in a country of anarchy? </P>
<P><B>Rhavadatta.</B> My dear Janardan, you are evading the real issue, as 
usual. There can <PB N="26"></PB>be no question about the order and regularity, 
and the festive rejoicing too is plain enough: there is no difficulty so far. 
But where is the King? Have you seen him? Just tell us that. </P>
<P><B>Janardan.</B> What I want to say is this: you know from your experience 
that there can be chaos and anarchy even if a King be present: but what do we 
see here? </P>
<P><B>Kaundilya.</B> You are always coming back to your quibbling. Why can you 
not give a straight answer to Bhavadatta's question--Have you, or have you not, 
seen the King? Yes or no? [<I>Exeunt.</I>] </P><PB N="27"></PB>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a band of MEN, singing</I>] </P>
<P align=center><B>Song.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>My beloved is ever in my heart<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I 
see him everywhere,<BR>He is in the pupils of my eyes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
is why I see him everywhere.<BR>I went far away to hear his own 
words,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ah, it was vain!<BR>When I came back I heard 
them<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own songs.<BR>Who are you who seek him like a 
beggar<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from door to door!<BR>Come to my heart and see his 
face in the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tears of my eyes! </I></P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter HERALDS and ADVANCE GUARDS of the KING</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Herald.</B> Stand off! Get away from the street, all of you! </P><PB 
N="28"></PB>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Eh, man, who do you think you are? You weren't of 
course born with such lofty strides, my friend?--Why should we stand off, my 
dear sir? Why should we budge? Are we street dogs, or what? </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Our King is coming this way. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> King? Which King? </P>
<P><B>First Herald.</B> Our King, the King of this country. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> What, is the fellow mad? Whoever heard of our King 
coming out heralded by these vociferous gentry? </P><PB N="29"></PB>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> The King will no longer deny himself to his subjects. 
He is coming to command the festivities himself. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Brother, is that so? </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Look, his banner is flying over there. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Ah, yes, that is a flag indeed. </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Do you see the red <I>Kimshuk</I> flower painted on it? 
</P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Yes, yes, it is the <I>Kimshuk</I> indeed!--what a 
bright scarlet flower! </P>
<P><B>First Herald.</B> Well! do you believe us now? </P><PB N="30"></PB>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> I never said I didn't. That fellow Kumbha started all 
this fuss. Did I say a word? </P>
<P><B>First Herald.</B> Perhaps, though a pot-bellied man, he is quite empty 
inside; an empty vessel sounds most, you know. </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Who is he? Is he any kinsman of yours? </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Not at all. He is just a cousin of our village chief's 
father-in-law, and he does not even live in the same part of our village with 
us. </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Just so: he quite looks the seventh cousin of 
somebody's father-in-law, <PB N="31"></PB>and his understanding appears also to 
bear the stamp of uncle-in-lawhood. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> Alas, my friends, many a bitter sorrow has given my poor mind 
a twist before it has become like this. It is only the other day that a King 
came and paraded the streets, with as many titles in front of him as the drums 
that made the town hideous by their din, . . . What did I not do to serve and 
please him! I rained presents on him, I hung about him like a beggar--and in the 
end I found the strain on my resources too hard to bear. But what was the end of 
all that pomp and majesty? When people sought grants and presents from him, he 
could not somehow discover an auspicious day in the Calendar: though all days 
were red-letter days when <EM>we</EM> had to pay our taxes! </P><PB N="32"></PB>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> Do you mean to insinuate that our King is a bogus King 
like the one you have described? </P>
<P><B>First Herald.</B> Mr. Uncle-in-law, I believe the time has come for you to 
say good-bye to Aunty-in-law. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> Please, sirs, do not take any offence. I am a poor 
creature--my sincerest apologies, sirs: I will do anything to be excused. I am 
quite willing to move away as far as you like. </P>
<P><B>Second Herald.</B> All right, come here and form a line. The King will 
come just now--we shall go and prepare the way for him. [<I>They go out.</I>] 
</P><PB N="33"></PB>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> My dear Kumbha, your tongue will be your death one 
day. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> Friend Madhav, it isn't my tongue, it is fate. When the bogus 
King appeared I never said a word, though that did not prevent my striking at my 
own feet with all the self-confidence of innocence. And now, when perhaps the 
real King has come, I simply must blurt out treason. It is fate, my dear friend! 
</P>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> My faith is, to go on obeying the King--it does not matter 
whether he is a real one or a pretender. What do we know of Kings that we should 
judge them! It is like throwing stones in the dark--you are almost sure of 
hitting your mark. I go on obeying <PB N="34"></PB>and acknowledging--if it is a 
real King, well and good: if not, what harm is there? </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> I should not have minded if the stones were nothing better 
than stones. But they are often precious things: here, as elsewhere, 
extravagance lands us in poverty, my friend. </P>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> Look! There comes the King! Ah, a King indeed! What a figure, 
what a face! Whoever saw such beauty--lily-white, creamy-soft! What now, Kumbha? 
What do you think now? </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> He looks all right--yes, he may be the real King for all I 
know. </P><PB N="35"></PB>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> He looks as if he were moulded and carved for kingship, a 
figure too exquisite and delicate for the common light of day. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter the "KING"</I>] </P>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> Prosperity and victory attend thee, O King! We have been 
standing here to have a sight of thee since the early morning. Forget us not, 
your Majesty, in your favours. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> The mystery deepens. I will go and call Grandfather.[<I>Goes 
out.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter another band of MEN</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> The King, the King! Come along, quick, the King is passing 
this way. </P><PB N="36"></PB>
<P><B>Second Man.</B> Do not forget me, O King! I am Vivajadatta, the grandson 
of Udayadatta of Kushalivastu. I came here at the first report of thy coming--I 
did not stop to hear what people were saying: all the loyalty in me went out 
towards thee, O Monarch, and brought me here. </P>
<P><B>Third Man.</B> Rubbish! I came here earlier than you--before the cockcrow. 
Where were you then? O King, I am Bhadrasena, of Vikramasthali. Deign to keep 
thy servant in thy memory! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> I am much pleased with your loyalty and devotion. </P>
<P><B>Vivajadatta.</B> Your Majesty, many are the grievances and complaints we 
have to make <PB N="37"></PB>to thee: to whom could we turn our prayers so long, 
when we could not approach thy august presence? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Your grievances will all be redressed. [<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> It won't do to lag behind, boys--the King will lose sight 
of us if we get mixed up with the mob. </P>
<P><B>Second Man.</B> See there-look what that fool Narottam is doing! He has 
elbowed his way through all of us and is now sedulously fanning the King with a 
palm leaf! </P>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> Indeed! Well, well, the sheer audacity of the man takes one's 
breath away. </P><PB N="38"></PB>
<P><B>Second Man.</B> We shall have to pitch the fellow out of that place--is he 
fit to stand beside the King? </P>
<P><B>Madhav.</B> Do you imagine the King will not see through him? His loyalty 
is obviously a little too showy and profuse. </P>
<P><B>First Man.</B> Nonsense! Kings can't scent hypocrites as we do--I should 
not be surprised if the King be taken in by that fool's strenuous fanning. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter KUMBHA with GRANDFATHER</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> I tell you--he has just passed by this street. </P><PB 
N="39"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather .</B> Is that a very infallible test of Kingship? </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> Oh no, he did not pass unobserved: not one or two men but 
hundreds and thousands on both sides of the street have seen him with their own 
eyes. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> That is exactly what makes the whole affair suspicious. 
When ever has our King set out to dazzle the eyes of the people by pomp and 
pageantry? He is not the King to make such a thundering row over his progress 
through the country. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> But he may just have chosen to do so on this important 
occasion: you cannot really tell. </P><PB N="40"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Oh yes, you can! My King cherishes no weathercock fancy, 
no fantastic vein. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> But, Grandfather, I wish I could only describe him! So soft, 
so delicate and exquisite like a waxen doll! As I looked on him, I yearned to 
shelter him from the sun, to protect him with my whole body. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Fool, O precious ass that you are! <EM>My</EM> King a 
waxen doll, and <EM>you</EM> to protect him! </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> But seriously, Grandpa, he is a superb god, a miracle of 
beauty: I do not find a single other figure in this vast assembly that can stand 
beside his peerless loveliness. </P><PB N="41"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> If my King chose to make himself shown, your eyes would 
not have noticed him. He would not stand out like that amongst others--he is one 
of the people, he mingles with the common populace. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> But did I not tell you I saw his banner? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What did you see displayed on his banner? </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> It had a red <I>Kimshuk</I> flower painted on it--the bright 
and glittering scarlet dazzled my eyes. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> <EM>My</EM> King has a thunderbolt within a lotus painted 
on his flag. </P><PB N="42"></PB>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> But every one is saying, the King is out in this festival: 
<EM>every one.</EM> </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Why, so he is, of course: but he has no heralds, no army, 
no retinue, no music bands or lights to accompany him. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> So none could recognise him in his incognito, it seems. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Perhaps there are a few that can. </P>
<P><B>Kumbha.</B> And those that can recognise him--does the King grant them 
whatever they ask for? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But they never ask for anything. No beggar will ever know 
the King. <PB N="43"></PB>The greater beggar appears like the King to the eyes 
of the lesser beggar. O fool, the man that has come out to-day attired in 
crimson and gold to beg from you--it is him whom you are trumpeting as your 
King! . . . Ah, there comes my mad friend! Oh come, my brothers! we cannot spend 
the day in idle wrangling and prating--let us now have some mad frolic, some 
wild enjoyment! </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter the MAD FRIEND, who sings</I>] </P>
<P><I>Do you smile, my friends? Do you laugh, my brothers? I roam in search of 
the golden stag! Ah yes, the fleet-foot vision that ever eludes me!</I> </P>
<P><I>Oh, he flits and glimpses like a flash and then is gone, the untamed rover 
of the wilds! Approach him and he is afar in a trice, leaving a cloud of haze 
and dust before thy eyes! </I></P><PB N="44"></PB>
<P><I>Yet I roam in search of the golden stag, though I may never catch him in 
these wilds! Oh, I roam and wander through woods and fields and nameless lands 
like a restless vagabond, never caring to turn my back. </I></P>
<P><I>You all come and buy in the marketplace and go back to your homes laden 
with goods and provisions: but me the wild winds of unscalable heights have 
touched and kissed--Oh, I know not when or where! </I></P>
<P><I>I have parted with my all to get what never has become mine! And yet think 
my moanings and my tears are for the things I thus have lost! </I></P>
<P><I>With a laugh and a song in my heart I have left all sorrow and grief far 
behind me: Oh, I roam and wander through woods and fields and nameless 
lands--never caring to turn my vagabond's back!</I> </P><PRE>

<H2>II</H2>
<P class=nh>[<I>A DarkChamber. QUEEN SUDARSHANA. Her Maid of Honour, 
SURANGAMA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Light, light! Where is light? Will the lamp never be 
lighted in this chamber? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> My Queen, all your other rooms are lighted--will you never 
long to escape from the light into a dark room like this? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But why should this room be kept dark? </P><PB 
N="46"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Because otherwise you would know neither light nor 
darkness. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Living in this dark room you have grown to speak darkly 
and strangely--I cannot understand you, Surangama. But tell me, in what part of 
the palace is this chamber situated? I cannot make out either the entrance or 
the way out of this room. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> This room is placed deep down, in the very heart of the 
earth. The King has built this room specially for your sake. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Why, he has no dearth of rooms--why need he have made this 
chamber of darkness specially for me? </P><PB N="47"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> You can meet others in the lighted rooms: but only in this 
dark room can you meet your lord. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> No, no--I cannot live without light--I am restless in this 
stifling dark. Surangama, if you can bring a light into this room, I shall give 
you this necklace of mine. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> It is not in my power, O Queen. How can I bring light to a 
place which he would have kept always dark! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Strange devotion! And yet, is it not true that the King 
punished your father? </P><PB N="48"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Yes, that is true. My father used to gamble. All the young 
men of the country used to gather at my father's house-and they used to drink 
and gamble. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> And when the King sent away your father in exile, did it 
not make you feel bitterly oppressed? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Oh, it made me quite furious. I was on the road to ruin and 
destruction: when that path was closed for me, I seemed left without any 
support, without any succour or shelter. I raged and raved like a wild beast in 
a cage--how I wanted to tear every one to pieces in my powerless anger! </P><PB 
N="49"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But how did you get this devotion towards that same King? 
</P>
<P><B>Sarangama .</B> How can I tell? Perhaps I could rely and depend on him 
because he was so hard, so pitiless! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> When did this change of feeling take place? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I could not tell you--I do not know that myself. A day came 
when all the rebel in me knew itself beaten, and then my whole nature bowed down 
in humble resignation on the dust of the earth. And then I saw . . . I saw that 
he was as matchless in beauty as in terror. Oh. I was saved, I was rescued. 
</P><PB N="50"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Tell me, Surangama, I implore you, won't you tell me what 
is the King like to look at? I have not seen him yet for a single day. He comes 
to me in darkness, and leaves me in this dark room again. How many people have I 
not asked--but they all return vague and dark answers--it seems to me that they 
all keep back something. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> To tell you the truth, Queen, I could not say well what he 
is like. No--he is not what men call handsome. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You don't say so? Not handsome! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, my Queen, he is not handsome. To call him beautiful 
would be to say far too little about him. </P><PB N="51"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> All your words are like that--dark, strange, and vague. I 
cannot understand what you mean. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, I will <EM>not</EM> call him handsome. And it is 
because he is not beautiful that he is so wonderful, so superb, so miraculous! 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I do not quite understand you--though I like to hear you 
talk about him. But I must see him at any cost. I do not even remember the day 
when I was married to him. I have heard mother say that a wise man came before 
my marriage and said, "He who will wed your daughter is without a second on this 
earth." How often have I asked her to describe his appearance to me, but she 
only answers vaguely, and says she cannot <PB N="52"></PB>say--she saw him 
through a veil, faintly and obscurely. But if he is the best among men, how can 
I sit still without seeing him? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Do you not feel a faint breeze blowing? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> A breeze? Where? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Do you not smell a soft perfume? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> No, I don't. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> The large door has opened . . . he is coming; my King is 
coming in. </P><PB N="53"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> How can you perceive when he comes? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I cannot say: I seem to hear his footsteps in my own heart. 
Being his servant of this dark chamber, I have developed a sense-I can know and 
feel without seeing. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Would that I had this sense too, Surangama! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> You will have it, O Queen . . . this sense will awaken in 
you one day. Your longing to have a sight of him makes you restless, and 
therefore all your mind is strained and warped in that direction. When you are 
past this state of feverish restlessness, everything will become quite easy. 
</P><PB N="54"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> How is it that it is easy to you, who are a servant, and 
so difficult to me, the Queen? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> It is because I am a mere servant that no difficulty baulks 
me. On the first day, when he left this room to my care, saying, "Surangama, you 
will always keep this chamber ready for me: this is all your task," then I did 
not say, even in thought, "Oh, give me the work of those who keep the other 
rooms lighted." No, but as soon as I bent all my mind to my task, a power woke 
and grew within me, and mastered every part of me unopposed. . . . Oh, there he 
comes! . . . he is standing outside, before the door. Lord! O King! </P><PB 
N="55"></PB>
<P align=center><B>Song outside.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>Open your door. I am waiting.<BR>The ferry of the light from the 
dawn to the dark is done for the day,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening 
star is up.<BR>Have you gathered your flowers, braided your 
hair,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;And donned your white robe for the night?<BR>The cattle 
have come to their folds and birds to their nests.<BR>The cross paths that run 
to all quarters have merged into one in the 
dark.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your door. I am waiting. </I></P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> O King, who can keep thy own doors shut against thee? They 
are not locked or bolted--they will swing wide open if you only touch them with 
thy fingers. Wilt thou not even touch them? Wilt thou not enter unless I go and 
open the doors? </P><PB N="56"></PB>
<P align=center><B>Song.</B> 
<P class=z><I>At a breath you can remove my veils, my lord!<BR>If I fall asleep

open the door and enter your own house unbidden?<BR></I></P>
<P class=d>Then do you go, O Queen, and open the door for him: he will not enter 
otherwise. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I do not see anything distinctly in the dark--I do not 
know where the doors are. You know everything here--go and open the doors for 
me. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>SURANGAMA opens the door, bows to the KING, and goes out. The 
KING will remain invisible throughout this play.</I>] </P><PB N="57"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Why do you not allow me to see you in the light? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> So you want to see me in the midst of a thousand things in broad 
daylight! Why should I not be the only thing you can feel in this darkness? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But I must see you--I am longing to have a sight of you. 
</P>
<P><B>King.</B> You will not be able to bear the sight of me--it will only give 
you pain, poignant and overpowering. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> How can you say that I shall be unable to bear your sight? 
Oh, I can feel even in this dark how lovely and <PB N="58"></PB>wonderful you 
are: why should I be afraid of you in the light? But tell me, can you see me in 
the dark? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Yes, I can. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What do you see? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> I see that the darkness of the infinite heavens, whirled into 
life and being by the power of my love, has drawn the light of a myriad stars 
into itself, and incarnated itself in a form of flesh and blood. And in that 
form, what acons of thought and striving, untold yearnings of limitless skies, 
the countless gifts of unnumbered seasons! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Am I so wonderful, so beautiful? When I hear you speak so, 
my heart <PB N="59"></PB>swells with gladness and pride. But how can I believe 
the wonderful things you tell me? I cannot find them in myself! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Your own mirror will not reflect them--it lessens you, limits 
you, makes you look small and insignificant. But could you see yourself mirrored 
in my own mind, how grand would you appear! In my own heart you are no longer 
the daily individual which you think you are--you are verily my second self. 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh, do show me for an instant how to see with your eyes! 
Is there nothing at all like darkness to you? I am afraid when I think of this. 
This darkness which is to me real and strong as death--is this simply nothing 
<PB N="60"></PB>to you? Then how can there be any union at all between us, in a 
place like this? No, no-it is impossible: there is a barrier betwixt us two: not 
here, no, not in this place. I want to find you and see you where I see trees 
and animals, birds and stones and the earth </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Very well, you can try to find me--but none will point me out to 
you. You will have to recognise me, if you can, yourself. And even if anybody 
professes to show me to you, how can you be sure he is speaking the truth? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I shall know you; I shall recognise you. I shall find you 
out among a million men. I cannot be mistaken. </P><PB N="61"></PB>
<P><B>King.</B> Very well, then, to-night, during the festival of the full moon 
of the spring, you will try to find me out from the high turret of my 
palace--search for me with your own eyes amongst the crowd of people. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Wilt thou be there among them? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> I shall show myself again and again, from every side of the 
crowd. Surangama! </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter SURANGAMA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> What is thy pleasure, lord? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> To-night is the full moon festival of the spring. </P><PB

<P><B>Surangama.</B> What have I to do to-night? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> To-day is a festive day, not a day of work. The pleasure gardens 
are in their full bloom--you will join in my festivities there. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I shall do as thou desirest, lord. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> The Queen wants to see me to-night with her own eyes. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Where will the Queen see you? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Where the music will play at its sweetest, where the air will be 
heavy <PB N="63"></PB>with the dust of flowers--there in the pleasure grove of 
silver light and mellow gloom. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> What can be seen in the hide-and-seek of darkness and 
light? There the wind is wild and restless, everything is dance and swift 
movement--will it not puzzle the eyes? </P>
<P><B>King.</B> The Queen is curious to search me out. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Curiosity will have to come back baffled and in tears! </P>
<P align=center><B>Song.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>Ah, they would fly away, the restless vagrant eyes, the wild birds

<P class=nh>[<I>Before the Pleasure Gardens. Enter AVANTI, KOSHALA, KANCHI, and 
other KINGS</I>] </P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> Will the King of this place not receive us? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> What manner of governing a country is this? The King is having 
a festival in a forest, where even the meanest and commonest people can have 
easy access! </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> We ought to have had a separate place set apart and ready for 
our reception. </P><PB N="66"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> If he has not prepared such a place yet, we shall compel him 
to have one erected for us. </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> All this makes one naturally suspect if these people have 
really got any King at all--it looks as if an unfounded rumour has led us 
astray. </P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> It may be so with regard to the King, but the Queen Sudarshana 
of this place isn't at all an unfounded rumour. </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> It is only for her sake that I have cared to come at all. I 
don't mind omitting to see one who never makes himself visible, but it would be 
a stupid Inistake if we were to go away <PB N="67"></PB>without a sight of one 
who is eminently worth a visit. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Let us make some definite plan, then. </P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> A plan is an excellent thing, so long as you are not yourself 
entangled in it. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Hang it, who are these vermin swarming this way? Here! who are 
you? </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER and the boys</I>] </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> We are the Jolly Band of Have-Nothings. </P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> The introduction was superfluous. But you will take yourselves 
away a little further and leave us in peace. </P><PB N="68"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> We never suffer from a want of space: we can afford to 
give you as wide a berth as you like. What little suffices for us is never the 
bone of contention between any rival claimants. Is not that so, my little 
friends? [<I>They sing.</I>] </P>
<P align=center><B>Song.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>We have nothing, indeed we have nothing at 
all!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sing merrily fol de rol de rol!<BR>Some build high

<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Look over there, Koshala, who are those coming this way? A 
pantomime? Somebody is out masquerading as a King. </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> The King of this place may tolerate all this tomfoolery, but 
we won't. </P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> He is perhaps some rural chief. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GUARDS on foot</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> What country does your King come from? </P><PB N="70"></PB>
<P><B>First Soldier.</B> He is the King of this country. He is going to command 
the festivities. [<I>They go out.</I>] </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> What! The King of this country come out for the festivities! 
</P>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> Indeed! We shall then have to return with a sight of him 
only--leaving the delectable Queen unseen. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Do you really think that fellow spoke the truth? Anybody can 
pass himself off as the King of this kingless country. Can you not see that the 
man looks like a dressed-up King--much too over-dressed? </P><PB N="71"></PB>
<P><B>Avanti.</B> But he looks handsome--his appearance is not without a certain 
pleasing attractiveness. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> He may be pleasing to your eye, but if you look at him closely 
enough there can be no mistaking him . You will see how I expose him before you 
all. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter the trumped-up "KING."</I>] </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> Welcome, princes, to our kingdom! I trust your reception has 
been properly looked after by my officials? </P>
<P><B>Kings.</B> [<I>with feigned courtesy</I>] Oh yes--nothing was lacking in 
the reception. </P><PB N="72"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> If there was any shortcoming at all, it has been made up by 
the honour of our sight of your Majesty. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> We do not show ourselves to the general public, but your great 
devotion and loyalty to us has made it a pleasure for us not to deny ourselves 
to you. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> It is truly hard for us, your Majesty, to bear the weight of 
your gracious favours. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> We are afraid we shall not be able to stop here long. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> I have thought so, already: you do not quite look up to it. 
</P><PB N="73"></PB>
<P><B>"King".</B> In the meantime if you have any favours to ask of us </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> We have: but we would like to speak a little more in private. 
</P>
<P><B>"King".</B> [<I>to his attendants</I>] Retire a little from our presence. 
(They retire.) Now you can express your desires without any reserve. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> There will be no reserve on our part--our only fear is that 
you might think restraint necessary for yourself. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> Oh no, you need have no scruples on that score. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Come, then, do us honage by placing your head on the ground 
before us. </P><PB N="74"></PB>
<P><B>"King".</B> It seems my servants have distributed the Varuni spirits too 
liberally in the reception camps. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> False pretender, it is you who are suffering from an overdose 
of arrogant spirits. Your head will soon kiss the dust. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> Princes, these heavy jokes are not worthy of a king. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Those who will jest properly with you are near at hand. 
General! </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> No more, I entreat you. I can see plainly I owe homage to you 
all. The head is bowing down of itself--there <PB N="75"></PB>is no need for the 
application of any sharp methods to lay it low. So here I do my obeisance to you 
all. If you kindly allow me to escape I shall not inflict my presence long on 
you. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Why should you escape? We will make you king of this 
place--let us carry our joke to its legitimate finish. Have you got any 
following? </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> I have. Every one who sees me in the streets flocks after me. 
When I had a meagre retinue at first every one regarded me with suspicion, but 
now with the increasing crowd their doubts are waning and dissolving. The crowd 
is being hypnotised by its own magnitude. I have not got to do anything now. 
</P><PB N="76"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> That's excellent! From this moment we all promise to help and 
stand by you. But you will have to do us one service in return. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> Your commands and the crown you are putting on my head will be 
equally binding and sacred to me. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> At present we want nothing more than a sight of the Queen 
Sudarshana. You will have to see to this. </P>
<P><B>"King".</B> I shall spare no pains for that. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> We cannot put much faith on your pains--you will be solely 
directed by <PB N="77"></PB>our instructions. But now you can go and join the 
festivities in the royal arbour with all possible splendour and 
magnificence.[<I>They go out.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER and a band of people</I>] </P>

it five hundred times--that our King is a perfect fraud. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Why only five hundred times? There is no need to practise 
such heroic self-control--you can say it five thousand times if that adds to 
your pleasure. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> But you cannot keep up a dead lie forever. </P><PB 
N="78"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> It has made me alive, my friend. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> We shall proclaim to the whole world that our King is a 
lie, the merest and emptiest shadow! </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> We shall all shout from our housetops that we have no 
King--let him do whatever he likes if he exists. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> He will do nothing at all. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> My son died untimely at twenty-five of raging fever in 
seven days. Could such a calamity befall me under the rule of a virtuous King? 
</P><PB N="79"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But you still have got two sons left: while I have lost 
all my five children one after another. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> What do you say now? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What then? Shall I lose my King too because I have lost 
my children? Don't take me for such a big fool as that. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> It is a fine thing to argue whether there is a King or 
not when one is simply starving for want of food! Will the King save us? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Brother, you are right. But why not <EM>find</EM> the 
King who owns all the food? You certainly will not find by your wailings at 
home. </P><PB N="80"></PB>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Look at the justice of our King! That Bhadrasen--you 
know what a touching sight he is when he is speaking of his King--the 
sentimental idiot! He is reduced to such a state of penury that even the bats 
that infest his house find it a too uncomfortable place. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Why, look at me! I am toiling and slaving night and day 
for my King, but I have not yet received so much as a brass farthing for my 
pains. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> Now, what do you think of that? </P><PB N="81"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What should I think? Does any one reward his friends? Go, 
my friends, and say if you like that our King exists nowhere. That is also a 
part of our ceremony in celebrating this festival. </P><PRE>

<P class=nh>[<I>Turret of the Royal Palace. SUDARSHANA and her friend 
ROHINI</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You may make mistakes, Rohini, but I cannot be mistaken: 
am I not the Queen? That, of course, must be my King. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> He who has conferred such high honour upon you cannot be long 
in showing himself to you. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> His very form makes me restless like a caged bird. Did you 
try well to ascertain who he is? </P><PB N="83"></PB>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Yes, I did. Every one I asked said that he was the King. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What country is he the King of? </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Our country, King of this land. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Are you sure that you are speaking of him who has a 
sunshade made of flowers held over his head? </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> The same: he whose flag has the <I>Kimshuk</I> flower painted 
on it. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I recognised him at once, of course, but it is you who had 
your doubts. </P><PB N="84"></PB>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> We are apt to make mistakes, my Queen, and we are afraid to 
offend you in case we are wrong. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Would that Surangama were here! There would remain no room 
for doubt then. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Do you think her cleverer than any of us? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh no, but she would recognise him instantly. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> I cannot believe that she would. She merely pretends to know 
him. There is none to test her knowledge if she professes to know the King. If 
we were as shameless as she is, it would <PB N="85"></PB>not have been difficult 
for us to boast about our acquaintance with the King. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But no, she never boasts. </P>
<P><B>Rohini .</B> It is pure affectation, the whole of it: which often goes a 
longer way than open boasting. She is up to all manner of tricks: that is why we 
could never like her. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But whatever you may say, I should have liked to ask her 
if she were here. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Very well, Queen. I shall bring her here. She must be lucky if 
she is indispensable for the Queen to know the King. </P><PB N="86"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh no--it isn't for that--but I would like to hear it said 
by every one. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Is not every one saying it? Why, just listen, the aeclamations 
of the people mount up even to this height! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Then do one thing: put these flowers on a lotus leaf, and 
take them to him. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> And what am I to say if he asks who sends them? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You will not have to say anything--he will know. He 
thought that I would not be able to recognise him: I cannot let him off without 
showing that I have found him out. [<I>ROHINI goes out with the flowers.</I>] 
</P><PB N="87"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> My heart is all a-quiver and restless to-night: I have 
never felt like this before. The white, silver light of the full moon is 
flooding the heavens and brimming over on every side like the bubbling foam of 
wine, . . . It seizes on me like a yearning, like a mantling intoxication. Here, 
who is here? </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a SERVANT</I>] </P>
<P><B>Servant.</B> What is your pleasure, your Majesty? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Do you see those festive boys singing and moving through 
the alleys and avenues of the mango trees? Call them hither, bring them to me: I 
want to hear them sing. [<I>SERVANT goes out and enters with the boys.</I>] <PB 
N="88"></PB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, living emblems of youthful spring, begin 
your festive song! All my mind and body is song and music to-night--but the 
ineffable melody escapes my tongue: do you then sing for my sake! </P>
<P align=center><B>Song.</B> </P>
<P class=z><I>My sorrow is sweet to me in this spring night.<BR>My pain smites 
at the chords of my love and softly sings.<BR>Visions take birth from my 
yearning eyes and flit in the moonlit sky.<BR>The smells from the depths of the 
woodlands have lost their way in my dreams.<BR>Words come in whispers to my 
ears, I know not from where,<BR>And bells in my anklets tremble and jingle in 
time with my heart thrills. </I></P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Enough, enough--I cannot bear it <PB N="89"></PB>any more! 
Your song has filled my eyes with tears. . . . A fancy comes to me--that desire 
can never attain its object--it need never attain it. What sweet hermit of the 
woods has taught you this song? Oh that my eyes could see him whose song my ears 
have heard! Oh, how I wish--I wish I could wander rapt and lovely in the thick 
woodland arbours of the heart! Dear boys of the hermitage! how shall I reward 
you? This necklace is but made of jewels, hard stones--its hardness will give 
you pain--I have got nothing like the garlands of flowers you have on. [<I>The 
boys bow and go out.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter ROHINI</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I have not done well--I have not done well, Rohini. I feel 
ashamed to <PB N="90"></PB>ask you what happened. I have just realised that no 
hand can really give the greatest of gifts. Still, let me hear all. </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> When I gave the King those flowers, he did not appear to 
understand anything. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You don't say so? He did not understand </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> No; he sat there like a doll, without uttering a single word. 
I think he did not want to show that he understood nothing, so he just held his 
tongue. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Fie on me! My shamelessness has been justly punished. Why 
did you not bring back my flowers? </P><PB N="91"></PB>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> How could I? The King of Kanchi, a very clever man, who was 
sitting by him, took in everything at a glance, and he just smiled a bit and 
said, "Emperor, the Queen Sudarshana sends your Majesty her greetings with these 
blossoms--the blossoms that belong to the God of Love, the friend of Spring." 
The King seemed to awake with a start, and said, "This is the crown of all my 
regal glory to-night." I was coming back, all out of countenance, when the King 
of Kanchi took off this necklace of jewels from the King's person, and said to 
me, "Friend, the King's garland gives itself up to you, in return for the happy 
fortune you have brought." </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What, Kanchi had to make the King understand all this! Woe 
is <PB N="92"></PB>me, to-night's festival has opened wide for me the doors of 
ignominy and shame! What else could I expect? Leave me alone, Rohini; I want 
solitude for a time. [<I>ROHINI goes out.</I>] A great blow has shattered my 
pride to atoms to-day, and yet . . . I cannot efface from my mind that 
beautiful, fascinating figure! No pride is left me-I am beaten, vanquished, 
utterly helpless. . . . I cannot even turn away from him. Oh, how the wish comes 
back to me again and again--to ask that garland of Rohini! But what would she 
think! Rohini! </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter ROHINI</I>] </P>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> What is your wish? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What reward do you deserve for your services to-day? 
</P><PB N="93"></PB>
<P><B>Rohini.</B> Nothing from you--but I had my reward from the King as it 
should be. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> That is no free gift, but an extortion, of reward. I do 
not like to see you put on what was given in so indifferent a manner. Take it 
off--I give you my bracelets if you leave it here. Take these bracelets, and go 
now. [<I>ROHINI goes out.</I>] Another defeat! I should have thrown this 
necklace away,--but I could not! It is pricking me as if it were a garland of 
thorns--but I cannot throw it away. This is what the god of the festival has 
brought me to-night--this necklace of ignominy and shame! </P><PRE>

love--it is soft as cream, delicate as the <I>shirisha</I> flower, beautiful as 
a butterfly. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> It is false as a mirage, empty as a bubble. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Let it bc--but I cannot stand near you--I simply cannot! I 
must fly away from here. Union with you, it cannot be possible! It cannot be 
anything but a false union--my mind must inevitably turn away from you. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Will you not even try a little? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I have been trying since yesterday--but the more I try, 
the more <PB N="120"></PB>rebellious does my heart become. If I stay with you I 
shall constantly be pursued and hounded by the thought that I am impure, that I 
am false and faithless. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Well then, you can go as far from me as you like. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I cannot fly away from you--just because you do not 
prevent my going. Why do you not hold me back, hold me by the hair, saying, "You 
shall not go"? Why do you not strike me? Oh, punish me, strike me, beat me with 
violent hands! But your unresisting silence makes me wild--oh, I cannot bear it! 
</P>
<P><B>King.</B> How do you think that I am really silent? How do you know that I 
am not trying to keep you back? </P><PB N="121"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh, no, no !--I cannot bear this--tell me aloud, command 
me with the voice of thunder, compel me with words that will drown everything 
else in my ears--do not let me off so easily, so mildly! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> I shall leave you free, but why should I let you break away from 
me? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You will not let me? Well then, I must go! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Go then! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Then I am not to blame at all. You could have held me back 
by force, but you did not! You have not hindered me-and now I shall go <PB 
N="122"></PB>away. Command your sentinels to prevent my going. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> No one will stand in your way. You can go as free as the broken 
storm-cloud driven by the tempest. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I can resist no more-something in me is impelling me 
forward--I am breaking away from my anchor! Perhaps I shall sink, but I shall 
return no more.[<I>She rushes out.</I>] </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter SURANGAMA, who sings</I>] </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> What will of thine is this that sends me afar! Again shall 
I come back at thy feet from all my wanderings. It is thy love that feigns this 
neglect--thy caressing hands are pushing me <PB N="123"></PB>away--to draw me 
back to thy arms again! O my King, what is this game that thou art playing 
throughout thy kingdom? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> [<I>re-entering</I>] King, O King! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> He has gone away. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Gone away? Well then, . . . then he has cast me off for 
good! I have come back, but he could not wait a single instant for me! Very 
well, then, I am now perfectly free. Surangama, did he ask you to keep me back? 
</P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, he said nothing. </P><PB N="124"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Why should he say anything? Why should he care for me? . . 
. I am then free, perfectly free. But, Surangama, I wanted to ask one thing of 
the King, but could not utter it in his presence. Tell me if he has punished the 
prisoners with death. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Death? My King never punishes with death. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What has he done to them, then? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> He has set them at liberty. Kanchi has acknowledged his 
defeat and gone back to his kingdom. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Ah, what a relief! </P><PB N="125"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> My Queen, I have one prayer to make to you. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You will not have to utter your prayer in words, 
Surangama. Whatever jewellery and ornaments the King gave me, I leave to you--I 
am not worthy to wear them now. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, I do not want them, my Queen. My master has never given 
me any ornaments to wear--my unadorned plainness is good enough for me. He has 
not given me anything of which I can boast before people. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What do you want of me then? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I too shall go with you, my Queen. </P><PB N="126"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Consider what you are saying; you are wanting to leave 
your master. What a prayer for you to make! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I shall not go far from him--when you are going out 
unguarded he will be with you, close by your side. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> You are talking nonsense, my child. I wanted to take 
Rohini with me, but she would not come. What gives you courage enough to wish to 
come with me? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I have got neither courage nor strength. But I shall 
go--courage will come of itself, and strength too will come. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> No, I cannot take you with me; <PB N="127"></PB>your 
presence will constantly remind me of my shame; I shall not be able to endure 
that. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> O my Queen, I have made all your good and all your evil my 
own as well; will you treat me as a stranger still? I must go with you. </P><PRE>

<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> I heard everything before her arrival. </P>
<P><B>Minister.</B> The princess is waiting alone outside the city gates on the 
bank of the river. Shall I send people to welcome her home? </P>
<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> What! She who has faithlessly left her 
husband--do you propose trumpeting her infamy and shame to <PB

<P><B>Minister.</B> Shall I then make arrangements for her residence at the 
palace? </P>
<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> You will do nothing of the sort. She has left her 
place as the Empress of her own accord--here she will have to work as a 
maid-servant if she wants to stay in my house. </P>
<P><B>Minister.</B> It will be hard and bitter to her, Your Highness. </P>
<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> If I seek to save her from her sufferings, then I 
am not worthy to be her father. </P><PB N="130"></PB>
<P><B>Minister.</B> I shall arrange everything as you wish, Your Highness. </P>
<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> Let it be kept a secret that she is my daughter; 
otherwise we shall all be in an awful trouble. </P>
<P><B>Minister.</B> Why do you fear such disaster, Your Highness? </P>
<P><B>King of Kanya Kubja.</B> When woman swerves from the right path, then she 
appears fraught with the direst calamity. You do not know with what deadly fear 
this daughter of mine has inspired me--she is coming to my home laden with peril 
and danger. </P><PRE>

<P class=nh>[<I>Inner Apartments of the Palace. SUDARSHANA and SURANGAMA</I>] 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Go away from me, Surangama! A deadly anger rages within 
me-I cannot bear anybody--it makes me wild to see you so patient and submissive. 
</P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Whom are you angry with? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I do not know; but I wish to see everything destroyed and 
convulsed in ruin and disaster! I left my place on the throne as the Empress in 
a <PB N="132"></PB>moment's time. Did I lose my all to sweep the dust, to sweat 
and slave in this dismal hole? Why do the torches of mourning not flare up for 
me all over the world? Why does not the earth quake and tremble? Is my fall but 
the unobserved dropping of the puny bean-flower? Is it not more like the fall of 
a glowing star, whose fiery blazon bursts the heavens asunder? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> A mighty forest only smokes and smoulders before it bursts 
into a conflagration: the time has not come yet. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I have thrown my queen's honour and glory to the dust and 
winds--but is there no human being who will come out to meet my desolate soul 
here? Alone--oh, I am fearfully, terribly alone! </P><PB N="133"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> You are not alone. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Surangama, I shall not keep anything from you. When he set 
the palace on fire, I could not be angry with him. A great inward joy set my 
heart a-flutter all the while. What a stupendous crime! What glorious prowess! 
It was this courage that made me strong and fired my own spirits. It was this 
terrible joy that enabled me to leave everything behind me in a moment's time. 
But is it all my imagination only? Why is there no sign of his coming anywhere? 
</P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> He of whom you are thinking did not set fire to the 
palace-it is the King of Kanchi who did it. </P><PB N="134"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Coward! But is it possible? So handsome, so bewitching, 
and yet no manhood in him! Have I deceived myself for the sake of such a 
worthless creature? O shame! Fie on me! . . . But, Surangama, don't you think 
that your King should yet have come to take me back? [<I>SURANGAMA remains 
silent.</I>] You think I am anxious to go back? Never! Even if the King really 
came I should not have returned. Not even once did he forbid me to come away, 
and I found all the doors wide open to let me out! And the stony and dusty road 
over which I walked--it was nothing to it that a queen was treading on it. It is 
hard and has no feelings, like your King; the meanest beggar is the same to it 
as the highest Empress. You are silent! Well, I tell you, your King's behaviour 
is--mean, brutal, shameful! </P><PB N="135"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Every one knows that my King is hard and pitiless--no one 
has ever been able to move him. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Why do you, then, call him day and night? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> May he ever remain hard and relentless like rock--may my 
tears and prayers never move him! Let my sorrows be ever mine only--and may his 
glory and victory be for ever! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Surangama, look! A cloud of dust seems to rise over the 
eastern horizon across the fields. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Yes, I see it. </P><PB N="136"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Is that not like the banner of a chariot? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Indeed, a banner it is. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Then he is coming. He has come at last! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Who is coming? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Our King--who else? How could he live without me? It is a 
wonder how he could hold out even for these days. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, no, this cannot be the King. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> "No," indeed! As if you know everything! Your King is 
hard, stony, <PB N="137"></PB>pitiless, isn't he? Let us see how hard he can be. 
I knew from the beginning that he would come-that he would have to rush after 
me. But remember, Surangama, I never for a single moment asked him to come. You 
will see how I make your King confess his defeat to me! Just go out, Surangama, 
and let me know everything. [<I>SURANGAMA goes out.</I>] But shall I go if he 
comes and asks me to return with him? Certainly not! I will not go! Never! </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter SURANGAMA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> It is not the King, my Queen. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Not the King? Are you quite sure? What! he has not come 
yet? </P><PB N="138"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, my King never raises so much dust when he comes. Nobody 
can know when he comes at all. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Then this is-- </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> The same: he is coming with the King of Kanchi. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Do you know his name? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> His name is Suvarna. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> It is he, then. I thought, "I am lying here like waste 
refuse and offal, which no one cares even to touch." But my hero is coming now 
to release me. Did you know Suvarna? </P><PB N="139"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> When I was at my father's home, in the gambling den </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> No, no, I won't hear anything of him from you. He is my 
own hero, my only salvation. I shall know him without your telling stories about 
him. But just see, a nice man your King is! He did not care to come to rescue me 
from even this degradation. You cannot blame me after this. I could not have 
waited for him all my life here, toiling ignominiously like a bondslave. I shall 
never have <EM>your</EM> meekness and submissiveness. </P><PRE>

<P class=nh>[<I>Encampment</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> [<I>To Kanya Kubja's Messenger.</I>] Tell your King that he 
need not receive us exactly as his guests. We are on our way back to our 
kingdoms, but we are waiting to rescue Queen Sudarshana from the servitude and 
degradation to which she is condemned here. </P>
<P><B>Messenger.</B> Your Highness, you will remember that the princess is in 
her father's house. </P><PB N="141"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> A daughter may stay in her father's home only so long as she 
remains unmarried. </P>
<P><B>Messenger.</B> But her connections with her father's family remain intact 
still. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> She has abjured all such relations now. </P>
<P><B>Messenger.</B> Such relationship can never be abjured, Your Highness, on 
this side of death: it may remain in abeyance at times, but can never be wholly 
broken up. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> If the King chooses not to give up his daughter to me on 
peaceful terms, our <I>Kshatriya</I> code of <PB N="142"></PB>righteousness will 
oblige me to employ force. You may take this as my last word. </P>
<P><B>Messenger.</B> Your Highness, do not forget that our King too is bound by 
the same code. It is idle to expect that he will deliver up his daughter by 
merely hearing your threats. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Tell your King that I have come prepared for such an answer. 
[<I>MESSENGER goes out.</I>] </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> King of Kanchi, it seems to me that we are daring too much. 
</P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> What pleasure would there be in this adventure if it were 
otherwise? </P><PB N="143"></PB>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> It does not cost much courage to challenge Kanya Kubja--but . 
. . </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> If you once begin to be afraid of "but," you will hardly find 
a place in this world safe enough for you. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a SOLDIER</I>] </P>
<P><B>Soldier.</B> Your Highness! I have just received the news that the Kings 
of Koshala, Avanti, and Kalinga are coming this way with their armies. 
[<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Just what I was afraid of! The report of Sudarshana's flight 
has spread abroad--now we are going to be in for a general scramble which is 
sure to end in smoke. </P><PB N="144"></PB>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> It is useless now, Your Highness. These are not good tidings. 
I am perfectly certain that it is our Emperor himself who has secretly spread 
the report everywhere. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Why, what good will it bring him? </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> The greedy ones will tear one another to pieces in the 
general rivalry and scramble-and he will take advantage of the situation to go 
back with the booty. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Now it becomes clear why your King never shows himself. His 
trick is to multiply himself on every side--fear makes him visible everywhere. 
But I will still maintain that your King <PB N="145"></PB>is but an empty fraud 
from top to bottom. </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> But, please Your Highness, will you have the kindness to let 
me off? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> I cannot let you go--I have some use for you in this affair. 
</P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter a SOLDIER</I>] </P>
<P><B>Soldier.</B> Your Highness, Virat, Panchal, and Vidarbha too have come. 
They have encamped on the other side of the river.[<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> In the beginning we must all fight together. Let the battle 
with Kanya Kubja first be over, then we shall find some way out of the 
difficulty. </P><PB N="146"></PB>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> Please do not drag me into your plans--I shall be happy if 
you leave me alone--I am a poor, mean creature--nothing can-- </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Look here, king of hypocrites, ways and means are never of a 
very exalted order--roads and stairs and so forth are always to be trodden under 
our feet. The advantage of utilising men like you in our plans is that we have 
to make use of no mask or illusion. But if I were to consult my prime minister, 
it would be absurd for me to call theft by any name less dignified than public 
benefit. I will go now, and move the princes about like pawns on the chessboard; 
the game cannot evidently go on if all the chessmen propose moving like kings!

<P class=nh>[<I>Interior of the Palace</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Is the fight still going on? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> As fiercely as ever. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Before going out to the battle my father came to me and 
said, "You have come away from one King, but you have drawn seven Kings after 
you: I have a mind to cut you up into seven pieces and distribute them among the 
princes. It would have been well if he did so. Surangama! </P><PB N="148"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Yes? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> If your King had the power to save me, could my present 
state have left him unmoved? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> My Queen, why do you ask me? Have I the power to answer for 
my King? I know my understanding is dark; that is why I never dare to judge him. 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Who have joined in this fight? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> All the seven princes. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> No one else? </P><PB N="149"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Suvarna attempted to escape--in secret before the fight 
began--but Kanchi has kept him a prisoner in his camps. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh, I should have been dead long ago! But, O King, my 
King, if you had come and helped my father, your fame would have been none the 
less! It would have become brighter and higher. Are you quite sure, Surangama, 
that he has not come? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I know nothing for certain. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But since I came here I have felt suddenly many a time as 
if somebody were playing on a <I>vina</I> below my window. </P><PB N="150"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> There is nothing impossible in the idea that somebody 
indulges his taste for music there. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> There is a deep thicket below my window--I try to find out 
who it is every time I hear the music, but I can see nothing distinctly. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Perhaps some wayfarer rests in the shade and plays on the 
instrument. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> It may be so, but my old window in the palace comes back 
to my memory. I used to come after dressing in the evening and stand at my 
window, and out of the blank darkness of our lampless meeting-place used to 
stream <PB N="151"></PB>forth strains and songs and melodies, dancing and 
vibrating in endless succession and overflowing profusion, like the passionate 
exuberance of a ceaseless fountain! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> O deep and sweet darkness! the profound and mystic darkness 
whose servant I was! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Why did you come away with me from that room? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Because I knew he would follow us and take us back. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But no, he will not come-he has left us for good. Why 
should he not? </P><PB N="152"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> If he can leave us like that, then we have no need of him. 
Then he does not exist for us: then that dark chamber is totally empty and 
void--no <I>vina</I> ever breathed its music there--none called you or me in 
that chamber; then everything has been a delusion and an idle dream. </P>

<P><B>Suvarna.</B> You say, then, that there will be no more necessity of any 
fight amongst yourselves? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> No, you need not be afraid. I have made all the princes agree 
that he whom the Queen accepts as her husband will have her, and the others will 
have to abandon all further struggle. </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> But you must have done with me now, Your Highness--so I beg 
to be <PB N="155"></PB>let off now. Unfit as I am for anything, the fear of 
impending danger has unnerved me and stunned my intellect. You will therefore 
find it difficult to put me to any use. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> You will have to sit there as my umbrella-holder. </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> Your servant is ready for anything; but of what profit will 
that be to you? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> My man, I see that your weak intellect cannot go with a high 
ambition in you. You have no notion yet with what favour the Queen looked upon 
you. After all, she cannot possibly throw the bridal garland on an 
umbrella-bearer's neck in a company of princes, and yet, I know, she <PB 
N="156"></PB>will not be able to turn her mind away from you. So on all accounts 
this garland will fall under the shade of my regal umbrella. </P>
<P><B>Suvarna.</B> Your Highness, you are entertaining dangerous imaginings 
about me. I pray you, please do not implicate me in the toils of such groundless 
notions. I beg Your Highness most humbly, pray set me at liberty. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> As soon as my object is attained, I shall not keep you one

<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Must I go to the assembly of the princes, then? Is there 
no other means of saving father's life? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> The King of Kanchi has said so. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana .</B> Are these the words worthy of a King? Did he say so with 
his own lips? </P><PB N="158"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> No, his messenger, Suvarna, brought this news. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Woe, woe is me! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> And he produced a few withered flowers and said, "Tell your 
Queen that the drier and more withered these souvenirs of the Spring Festival 
become, the fresher and more blooming do they grow within in my heart." </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Stop! Tell me no more. Do not torment me any more. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Look! There sit all the princes in the great assembly. He 
who has no ornament on his person, except a <PB N="159"></PB>single garland of 
flowers round his crown--he is the King of Kanchi. And he who holds the umbrella 
over his head, standing behind him--that is Suvarna. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Is that Suvarna? Are you quite certain? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Yes, I know him well. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Can it be that it is this man that I saw the other day? 
No, no,--I saw something mingled and transfused and blended with light and 
darkness, with wind and perfume,--no, no, it cannot be he; that is not he. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> But every one admits that he is exceedingly beautiful to 
look at. </P><PB N="160"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> How could <EM>that</EM> beauty fascinate me? Oh, what 
shall I do to purge my eyes of their pollution? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> You will have to wash them in that bottomless darkness. 
</P>

</P>

alone, and you have been but just in doing so. But will you not know the inmost 
truth within my soul? [<I>Taking out a dagger from within her bosom.</I>] This 
body of mine has received a stain--I shall make a sacrifice of it to-day in the 
dust of the hall, before all these princes! But shall I never be able to tell 
you that I know of no stain of faithlessness within the hidden chambers of my 
heart? That dark chamber where you would come to meet me lies cold and empty 
within my bosom to-day--but, O my Lord! none has opened its doors, none has 
entered it but you, O King! Will you never come again to open those doors? Then, 
let death come, for it is dark like yourself, and its features are beautiful as 
yours . It is you--it is yourself, O King! </P><PRE>

<P class=nh>[<I>The Gathering of the PRINCES</I>] </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> King of Kanchi, how is it that you have not got a single 
piece of ornament on your person? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Because I entertain no hopes at all, my friend. Ornaments 
would but double the shame of my defeat. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> But your umbrella-bearer seems to have made up for that,--he 
is loaded with gold and jewellery all over. </P><PB N="163"></PB>
<P><B>Virat.</B> The King of Kanchi wants to demonstrate the futility and 
inferiority of outer beauty and grandeur. Vanity of his prowess has made him 
discard all outer embellishments from his limbs. </P>
<P><B>Kosliala.</B> I am quite up to his trickery; he is seeking to prove his 
own dignity, maintaining a severe plainness among the bejewelled princes. </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> I cannot commend his wisdom in this matter. Every one knows 
that a woman's eyes are like a moth in that they fling themselves headlong on 
the glare and glitter of jewel and gold. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> But how long shall we have to wait more? </P><PB 
N="164"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Do not grow impatient, King of Kalinga--sweet are the fruits 
of delay. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> If I were sure of the fruit I could have endured it. It is 
because my hopes of tasting the fruit are extremely precarious that my eagerness 
to have a sight of her breaks through all bounds. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> But you are young still--abandoned hope comes back to you 
again and again like a shameless woman at your age: we, however, have long 
passed that stage. </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> Kanchi, did you feel as if something shook your seat just 
now? Is it an earthquake? </P><PB N="165"></PB>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Earthquake? I do not know. </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> Or perhaps some other prince is coming with his army. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> There is nothing against your theory except that we should 
have first heard the news from some herald or messenger in that case. </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> I cannot regard this as a very auspicious omen. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Everything looks inauspicious to the eye of fear. </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> I fear none except Fate, before <PB N="166"></PB>which 
courage or heroism is as futile as it is absurd. </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Vidarbha, do not darken to-day's happy proceedings with your 
unwelcome prognostications. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> I never take the unseen into account till it has become 
"seen." </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> But then it might be too late to do anything. </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Did we not all of us start at a specially auspicious moment? 
</P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> Do you think you insure against every possible risk by 
starting at <PB N="167"></PB>auspicious moments? It looks as if-- </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> You had better let the "as if" alone: though our own creation, 
it often proves our ruin and destruction. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> Isn't that music somewhere outside? </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Yes, it sounds like music, sure enough. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Then at last it must be the Queen Sudarshana who is 
approaching near. [<I>Aside to SUVARNA.</I>] Suvarna, you must not hide and 
cower behind me like that. Mind, the umbrella in your hand is shaking! </P><PB

<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER, dressed as a warrior</I>] </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> Who is that?--Who are you? </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Who is this that dares to enter this hall without being 
invited? </P>
<P><B>Virat.</B> Amazing impudence! Kalinga, just prevent the fellow from 
advancing further. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> You are all my superiors in age--you are fitter to do that

<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> Let us hear what he has to say. </P>

<P><B>Kalinga.</B> Who is he? </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> What do you mean? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You all know whom I mean. He has come. </P><PB 
N="170"></PB>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> He has come? </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> With what intention? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> He has summoned you all to come to him. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Summoned us, indeed? In what terms has he been pleased to 
summon us? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You can take his call in any way you like--there is none 
to prevent you--he is prepared to make all kinds of welcome to suit your various 
tastes. </P>
<P><B>Virat.</B> But who are you? </P><PB N="171"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> I am one of his generals. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Generals? It is a lie! Do you think of frightening us? Do you 
imagine that I cannot see through your disguise? We all know you well--and you 
pose as a "general" before us! </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You have recognised me to perfection. Who is so unworthy 
as I to bear my King's commands? And yet it is he who has invested me with these 
robes of a general and sent me here: he has chosen me before greater generals 
and mightier warriors. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> All right, we shall go to observe the proprieties and 
amenities on a fitting <PB N="172"></PB>occasion--but at present we are in the 
midst of a pressing engagement. He will have to wait till this little function 
is over. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> When he sends out his call he does not wait. </P>
<P><B>Koshala.</B> I shall obey his call; I am going at once. </P>
<P><B>Vidarbha.</B> Kanchi, I cannot agree with you in your proposal to wait 
till this function is over. I am going. </P>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> You are older than I am--I shall follow you. </P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Look behind you, Prince of Kanchi, your regal umbrella is 
lying in the <PB N="173"></PB>dust: you have not noticed when your 
umbrella-holder has stolen away. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> All right, general. I too am going--but not to do him homage. 
I go to fight him on the battle-ground. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You will meet my King in the field of battle: that is no 
mean place for your reception. </P>
<P><B>Virat.</B> Look here, friends, perhaps we are all flying before an 
imagined terror--it looks as if the King of Kanchi will have the best of it. 
</P>
<P><B>Panchala.</B> Possibly, when the fruit is so near the hand, it is cowardly 
and foolish to go away without plucking it. </P><PB N="174"></PB>
<P><B>Kalinga.</B> It is better to join the King of Kanchi. He cannot be without 
a definite plan and purpose when he is doing and daring so much. </P><PRE>

<P class=nh>[<I>SUDARSHANA and SURANGAMA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> The fight is over now. When will the King come? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I do not know myself: I am also looking forward to his 
coming. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I feel such a throb of joy, Surangama, that my breast is 
positively aching. But I am dying with shame too; how shall I show my face to 
him? </P><PB N="176"></PB>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Go to him in utmost humility and resignation, and all shame 
will vanish in a moment. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I cannot help confessing that I have met with my uttermost 
defeat for all the rest of my life. But pride made me claim the largest share in 
his love so long. Every one used to say I had such wonderful beauty, such graces 
and virtues; every one used to say that the King showed unlimited kindness 
towards me-this is what makes it difficult for me to bend my heart in humility 
before him. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> This difficulty, my Queen, will pass off. </P><PB 
N="177"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh, yes, it will pass--the day has arrived for me to 
humble myself before the whole world. But why does not the King come to take me 
back? What more is he waiting for yet? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Have I not told you my King is cruel and hard--very hard 
indeed? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Go out, Surangama, and bring me news of him. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I do not know where I should go to get any news of him. I 
have asked Grandfather to come; perhaps when he comes we shall hear something 
from him. </P><PB N="178"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Alack, my evil fate! I have been reduced to asking others 
to hear about my own King! </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I have heard that you are my King's friend, so accept my 
obeisance and give me your blessings. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What are you doing, Queen? I never accept anybody's 
obeisance. My relation with every one is only that of comradeship. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Smile on me, then--give me good news. Tell me when the 
King is coming to take me back. </P><PB N="179"></PB>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You ask me a hard question, indeed! I hardly understand 
yet the ways of my friend. The battle is over, but no one can tell where he is 
gone. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Is he gone away, then? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> I cannot find any trace of him here. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Has he gone? And do you call such a person your friend? 
</P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> That is why he gets people's abuse as well as suspicion. 
But my King simply does not mind it in the least. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Has he gone away? Oh, oh, how hard, how cruel, how cruel! 
He is <PB N="180"></PB>made of stone, he is hard as adamant! I tried to move him 
with my own bosom--my breast is torn and bleeding--but him I could not move an 
inch! Grandfather, tell me, how can you manage with such a friend? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> I have known him now--I have known him through my griefs 
and joys--he can make me weep no more now. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Will he not let me know him also? </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Why, he will, of course. Nothing else will satisfy him. 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Very well, I shall see how hard he can be! I shall stay 
here near the window without saying a word; I <PB N="181"></PB>shall not move an 
inch; let me see if he will not come! </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> You are young still--you can afford to wait for him; but 
to me, an old man, a moment's loss is a week. I must set out to seek him whether 
I succeed or not.[<I>Exit.</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> I do not want him--I will not seek him! Surangama, I have 
no need of your King! Why did he fight with the princes? Was it for me at all? 
Did he want to show off his prowess and strength? Go away from here--I cannot 
bear your sight. He has humbled me to the dust, and is not satisfied still! </P><PRE>

<P></P>
<P class=nh>[<I>A Band of Citizens</I>] </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> When so many Kings met together, we thought we were 
going to have some big fun; but somehow everything took such a turn that nobody 
knows what happened at all! </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Did you not see, they could not come to an agreement 
among themselves?--every one distrusted every one else. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> None kept to their original plans; one wanted to 
advance, another thought <PB N="183"></PB>it better policy to recede; some went 
to the right, others made a rush to the left: how can you call that a fight? 
</P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> They had no eye to real fighting--each had his eye on 
the others. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Each was thinking, "Why should I die to enable others 
to reap the harvest?" </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> But you must all admit that Kanchi fought like a real 
hero. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> He for a long time after his defeat seemed loth to 
acknowledge himself beaten. </P><PB N="184"></PB>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> He was at last fixed in the chest by a deadly missile. 
</P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> But before that he did not seem to realise that he had 
been losing ground at every step. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> As for the other Kings--well, nobody knows where they 
fled, leaving poor Kanchi alone in the field. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> But I have heard that he is not dead yet. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> No, the physicians have saved him--but he will carry 
the mark of his defeat on his breast till his dying day. </P><PB N="185"></PB>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> None of the other Kings who fled has escaped; they have 
all been taken prisoners. But what sort of justice is this that was meted out to 
them? </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> I heard that every one was punished except Kanchi, 
whom the judge placed on his right on the throne of justice, putting a crown on 
his head. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> This beats all mystery hollow. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> This sort of justice, to speak frankly, strikes us as 
fantastic and capricious. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Just so. The greatest offender is certainly the King of 
Kanchi; as for <PB N="186"></PB>the others, greed of gain now pressed them to 
advance, now they drew back in fear. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> What kind of justice is this, I ask? It is as if the 
tiger got scot-free, while his tail got cut off. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> If I were the judge, do you think Kanchi would be 
whole and sound at this hour? There would be nothing left of him altogether. 
</P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> They are great, high justices, my friends; their brains 
are of a different stamp from ours. </P>
<P><B>First Citizen.</B> Have they got any brains at all, I wonder? They simply 
indulge their <PB N="187"></PB>sweet whims as there are none to say anything to 
them from above. </P>
<P><B>Second Citizen.</B> Whatever you may say, if we had the governing power in 
our hands we should certainly have carried on the government much better than 
this. </P>
<P><B>Third Citizen.</B> Can there be any real doubts about that? That of course 
goes without saying. </P><PRE>

<P><B>Grandfather.</B> What, Prince of Kanchi, you here! </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Your King has sent me on the road. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> That is a settled habit with him. </P>

<P><B>Grandfather.</B> That too is one of his amusements. </P><PB N="189"></PB>

could make me acknowledge him as my King, he came all of a sudden like a 
terrific tempest--God knows from where--and scattered my men and horses and 
banners in one wild tumult: but now, when I am seeking the ends of the earth to 
pay him my humble homage, he is nowhere to be seen. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But however big an Emperor he may be, he has to submit to 
him that yields. But why have you come out at night, Prince? </P>

being laughed at by people when they see me meekly <PB N="190"></PB>doing my

<P class=nh>[<I>A Road. SUDARSHANA and SURANGAMA</I>] </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> What a relief, Surangama, what freedom! It is my defeat 
that has brought me freedom. Oh, what an iron pride was mine! Nothing could move 
it or soften it. My darkened mind could not in any way be brought to see the 
plain truth that it was not the King who was to come, it was I who ought to have 
gone to him. All through yesternight I lay alone on the dusty floor before that 
window--lay there through the desolate hours and wept! All night the southern 
winds blew and shrieked and moaned like <PB N="193"></PB>the pain that was 
biting at my heart; and all through it I heard the plaintive "Speak, wife!" of 
the nightbird echoing in the tumult outside! . . . It was the helpless wail of 
the dark night, Surangama! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Last night's heavy and melancholy air seemed to hang on for 
an eternity--oh, what a dismal and gboomy night! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> But would you believe it--I seemed to hear the soft 
strains of the <I>vina</I> floating through all that wild din and tumult! Could 
he play such sweet and tender tunes, he who is so cruel and terrible? The world 
knows only my indignity and ignominy--but none but my own heart could hear those 
<PB N="194"></PB>strains that called me through the lone and wailing night. Did 
you too, Surangama, hear the <I>vina</I>? Or was that but a dream of mine? </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> But it is just to hear that same <I>vina's</I> music that I 
am always by your side. It is for this call of music, which I knew would one day 
come to dissolve all the barriers of love, that I have all along been listening 
with an cager ear. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> He did at last send me on the open road--I could not 
withstand his will. When I shall find him, the first words that I shall tell him 
will be, "I have come of my own will--I have not awaited your coming." I shall 
say, "For your sake have I trodden the hard and weary roads, and bitter and <PB 
N="195"></PB>ceaseless has been my weeping all the way." I shall at least have 
this pride in me when I meet him. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> But even that pride will not last. He came before you 
did--who else could have sent you on the road? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Perhaps he did. As long as a sense of offended pride 
remained with me, I could not help thinking that he had left me for good; but 
when I flung my dignity and pride to the winds and came out on the common 
streets, then it seemed to me that he too had come out: I have been finding him 
since the moment I was on the road. I have no misgivings now. All this suffering 
that I have gone through for his sake, the very bitternesss of all this is 
giving me his company. Ah! <PB N="196"></PB>yes, he has come--he has held me by 
the hand, just as he used to do in that chamber of darkness, when, at his touch, 
all my body would start with a sudden thrill: it is the same, the same touch 
again! Who says that he is not here?--Surangama, can you not see that he has 
come, in silence and secret? . . . Who is that there? Look, Surangama, there is 
a third traveller of this dark road at this hour of the night. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> I see, it is the King of Kanchi, my Queen. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> King of Kanchi! </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Don't be afraid, my Queen! </P><PB N="197"></PB>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Afraid! Why should I be afraid? The days of fear are gone 
for ever for me. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> [<I>entering</I>] Queen-mother, I see you two on this road! I 
am a traveller of the same path as yourself. Have no fear of me, O Queen! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> It is well, King of Kanchi, that we should be going 
together, side by side--this is but right. I came on your way when I first left 
my home, and now I meet you again on my way back. Who could have dreamed that 
this meeting of ours would augur so well? </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> But, Queen-mother, it is not meet that you should walk over 
this road <PB N="198"></PB>on foot. Will you permit me to get a chariot for you? 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh, do not say so: I shall never be happy if I could not 
on my way back home tread on the dust of the road that led me away from my King. 
I would be deceiving myself if I were now to go in a chariot. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> King, you too are walking in the dust to-day: this road has 
never known anybody driving his horse or chariot over it. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> When I was the Queen, I stepped over silver and gold--I 
shall have now to atone for the evil fortune of my birth by walking over dust 
and <PB N="199"></PB>bare earth. I could not have dreamed that thus I would meet 
my King of common earth and dust at every step of mine to-day. </P>
<P><B>Surangama.</B> Look, my Queen, there on the eastern horizon comes the 
dawn. We have not long to walk: I see the spires of the golden turrets of the 
King's palace. </P>
<P class=nh>[<I>Enter GRANDFATHER</I>] </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> My child, it is dawn--at last! </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Your benedictions have given me Godspeed, and here I am, 
at last. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But do you see how ill-mannered our King is? He has sent 
no chariot, <PB N="200"></PB>no music band, nothing splendid or grand. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Nothing grand, did you say? Look, the sky is rosy and 
crimson from end to end, the air is full of the welcome of the scent of flowers. 
</P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> Yes, but however cruel our King may be, we cannot seek to 
emulate him: I cannot help feeling pain at seeing you in this state, my child. 
How can we bear to see you going to the King's palace attired in this poor and 
wretched attire? Wait a little--I am running to fetch you your Queen's garments. 
</P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh no, no, no! He has taken away those regal robes from me 
for ever--he has attired me in a servant's dress <PB N="201"></PB>before the 
eyes of the whole world: what a relief this has been to me! I am his servant 
now, no longer his Queen. To-day I stand at the feet of all those who can claim 
any relationship with him. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> But your enemies will laugh at you now: how can you bear 
their derision? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Let their laughter and derision be immortal--let them 
throw dust at me in the streets: this dust will to-day be the powder with which 
I shall deck myself before meeting my lord. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> After this, we shall say nothing. Now let us play the 
last game of our Spring Festival--instead of the pollen of flowers let the south 
breeze blow <PB N="202"></PB>and scatter dust of lowliness in every direction! 
We shall go to the lord clad in the common grey of the dust. And we shall find 
him too covered with dust all over. For do you think the people spare him? Even 
he cannot escape from their soiled and dusty hands, and he does not even care to 
brush the dirt off his garments. </P>
<P><B>Kanchi.</B> Grandfather, do not forget me in this game of yours! I also 
will have to get this royal garment of mine soiled till it is beyond all 
recognition. </P>
<P><B>Grandfather.</B> That will not take long, my brother. Now that you have 
come down so far--you will change your colour in no time. Just look at our 
Queen--she got into a temper with herself and thought that she could spoil her 
<PB N="203"></PB>matchless beauty by flinging away all her ornaments: but this 
insult to her beauty has made it shine forth in tenfold radiance, and now it is 
in its unadorned perfection. We hear that our King is all innocent of 
beauty--that is why he loves all his manifold beauty of form which shines as the 
very ornament of his breast. And that beauty has to-day taken off its veil and 
cloak of pride and vanity! What could I not give to be allowed to hear the 
wonderful music and song that has filled my King's palace to-day! </P>

<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Lord, do not give me back the honour which you once did 
turn away from me! I am the servant of your feet--I only seek the privilege of 
serving you. </P>
<P><B>King.</B> Will you be able to bear me now? </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Oh yes, yes, I shall. Your sigh repelled me because I had 
sought to find you in the pleasure garden, in my Queen's chambers: there even 
your <PB N="205"></PB>meanest servant looks handsomer than you. That fever of 
longing has left my eyes for ever. You are not beautiful, my lord--you stand 
beyond all comparisons! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> That which can be comparable with me lies within yourself. </P>
<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> If this be so, then that too is beyond comparison. Your 
love lives in me--you are mirrored in that love, and you see your face reflected 
in me: nothing of this mine, it is all yours, O lord! </P>
<P><B>King.</B> I open the doors of this dark room to-day--the game is finished 
here! Come, come with me now, come outside--<EM>into the light!</EM> </P><PB

<P><B>Sudarshana.</B> Before I go, let me bow at the feet of my lord of 
darkness, my cruel, my terrible, my peerless one! </P><PRE>

This file should be named kdkch10h.txt or kdkch10h.zip

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net/pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at

     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"

     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
