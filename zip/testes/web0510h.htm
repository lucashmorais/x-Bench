<h1>
Deuteronomy
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> These are the words which
Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the
Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and
Hazeroth, and Dizahab.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> It
is eleven days' <I>journey</I> from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to
Kadesh Barnea.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> It happened
in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the
month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that
Yahweh had given him in commandment to them;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> after he had struck Sihon the king
of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who
lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Beyond the Jordan, in the land of
Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Yahweh our God spoke to us in
Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> turn, and take your journey, and
go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all <I>the places</I> near
there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the
South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as
far as the great river, the river Euphrates.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Behold, I have set the land before
you: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after
them.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> I spoke to you at
that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Yahweh your God has multiplied
you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
 <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as
he has promised you!  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> How
can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife?  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Take wise men of
understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make
them heads over you.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> You
answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good <I>for
us</I> to do.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> So I took
the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over
you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of
fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
 <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> I commanded your judges
at that time, saying, Hear <I>the causes</I> between your brothers, and
judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is
living with him.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> You
shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the
great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment
is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me,
and I will hear it.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> I
commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> We traveled from Horeb, and went
through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way
to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and
we came to Kadesh Barnea.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> I said to you, You are come to
the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
 <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Behold, Yahweh your God
has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of
your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
 <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> You came near to me
everyone of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search
the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go
up, and the cities to which we shall come.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> The thing pleased me well; and I
took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> and they turned and went up into
the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
 <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> They took of the fruit of
the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word
again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
 <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> Yet you wouldn't go up,
but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God:  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> and you murmured in your tents,
and said, Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land
of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
 <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> Where are we going up?
our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater
and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and
moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> Then I said to you, Don't dread,
neither be afraid of them.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> Yahweh your God who goes before
you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt
before your eyes,  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> and in
the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as
a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to
this place.  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> Yet in this
thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,  <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> who went before you in the way,
to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show
you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.  <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> Yahweh heard the voice of your
words, and was angry, and swore, saying,  <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> Surely there shall not one of
these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I swore to give
to your fathers,  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> save
Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the
land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly
followed Yahweh.  <a name="C1V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:37</font></a> Also
Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in
there:  <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> Joshua the son of
Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for
he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> Moreover your little ones, whom
you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no
knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give
it, and they shall possess it.  <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> But as for you, turn you, and
take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the <a href="#N1">Red
Sea</a>.  <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> Then you
answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and
fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. You girded on
every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill
country.  <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> Yahweh said to
me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest
you be struck before your enemies.  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> So I spoke to you, and you didn't
listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were
presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.  <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> The Amorites, who lived in that
hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat
you down in Seir, even to Hormah.  <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> You returned and wept before
Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
 <a name="C1V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:46</font></a> So you abode in Kadesh
many days, according to the days that you abode <I>there</I>.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Then we turned, and
took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the <a href="#N2">Red
Sea</a>, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.
 <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Yahweh spoke to me,
saying,  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> You have encircled
this mountain long enough: turn you northward.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Command you the people, saying,
You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau,
who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to
yourselves therefore;  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> don't contend with them; for I
will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the
foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a
possession.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> You shall
purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy
water of them for money, that you may drink.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> For Yahweh your God has blessed
you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this
great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you
have lacked nothing.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> So we
passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from
the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and
passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Don't bother
Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his
land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for
a possession.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> (The Emim
lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
 <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> these also are accounted
Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> The Horites also lived in Seir
before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them
from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of
his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Now rise up, and get you over the
brook Zered. We went over the brook Zered.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> The days in which we came from
Kadesh Barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight
years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the
midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Moreover the hand of Yahweh was
against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were
consumed.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> So it happened,
when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
 <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> that Yahweh spoke to me,
saying,  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> You are this day
to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> and when you come near over
against the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor contend with them;
for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a
possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a
possession.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> (That also is
accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the
Ammonites call them Zamzummim,  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> a people great, and many, and
tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they
succeeded them, and lived in their place;  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> as he did for the children of
Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them;
and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
 <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> and the Avvim, who lived
in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor,
destroyed them, and lived in their place.)  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> Rise up, take your journey, and
pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand
Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and
contend with him in battle.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> This day will I begin to put the
dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole
sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in
anguish because of you.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> I
sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon
with words of peace, saying,  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> Let me pass through your land: I
will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to
the left.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> You shall sell
me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may
drink: only let me pass through on my feet,  <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> as the children of Esau who dwell
in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass
over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> But Sihon king of Heshbon would
not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made
his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this
day.  <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> Yahweh said to me,
Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to
possess, that you may inherit his land.  <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> Then Sihon came out against us,
he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.  <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> Yahweh our God delivered him up
before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.  <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> We took all his cities at that
time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the
little ones; we left none remaining:  <a name="C2V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:35</font></a> only the livestock we took for a
prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
 <a name="C2V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:36</font></a> From Aroer, which is on
the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and <I>from</I> the city that is in
the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh
our God delivered up all before us:  <a name="C2V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:37</font></a> only to the land of the children
of Ammon you didn't come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the
cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Then we turned, and
went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us,
he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him;
for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your
hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
who lived at Heshbon.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> So
Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and
all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.
 <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> We took all his cities at
that time; there was not a city which we didn't take from them; sixty
cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> All these were cities fortified
with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.
 <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> We utterly destroyed them,
as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited
city, with the women and the little ones.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> But all the livestock, and the
spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> We took the land at that time out
of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan,
from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> (<I>which</I> Hermon the Sidonians
call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> all the cities of the plain, and
all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of
Og in Bashan.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> (For only
Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his
bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of
Ammon? nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the
cubit of a man.)  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> This
land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the
valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities,
gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> and the rest of Gilead, and all
Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the
region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
 <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Jair the son of Manasseh
took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth
Jair, to this day.)  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> I
gave Gilead to Machir.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> To
the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of
the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border <I>of it</I>, even to
the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> the Arabah also, and the Jordan
and the border <I>of it</I>, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the
Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> I commanded you at that time,
saying, Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall
pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men
of valor.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> But your wives,
and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much
livestock), shall abide in your cities which I have given you,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> until Yahweh give rest to your
brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God
gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his
possession, which I have given you.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> I commanded Joshua at that time,
saying, Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two
kings: so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> You shall not fear them; for
Yahweh your God, he it is who fights for you.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> I begged Yahweh at that time,
saying,  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> Lord Yahweh, you
have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for
what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your
works, and according to your mighty acts?  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Please let me go over and see the
good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
 <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> But Yahweh was angry with
me for your sakes, and didn't listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it
suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> Go up to the top of Pisgah, and
lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward,
and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> But commission Joshua, and
encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this
people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
 <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> So we abode in the valley
over against Beth Peor.
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Now, Israel, listen to
the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that
you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, gives you.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> You
shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish
from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I
command you.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Your eyes
have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who
followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of
you.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> But you who did
cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone of you this day.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Behold, I have taught you statutes
and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so
in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Keep therefore and do them; for
this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples,
who shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
wise and understanding people.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> For what great nation is there,
that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on
him?  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> What great nation is
there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law,
which I set before you this day?  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Only take heed to yourself, and
keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw,
and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make
them known to your children and your children's children;  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> the day that you stood before
Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, Assemble me the people,
and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the
days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.
 <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> You came near and stood
under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the
sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Yahweh spoke to you out of the
midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only
<I>you heard</I> a voice.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> He declared to you his covenant,
which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote
them on two tables of stone.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Yahweh commanded me at that time
to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land
where you go over to possess it.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Take therefore good heed to
yourselves; for you saw no manner of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to
you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Lest you corrupt yourselves, and
make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of
male or female,  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> the
likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged
bird that flies in the sky,  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> the likeness of anything that
creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under
the earth;  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> and lest you
lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and
the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship
them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the
peoples under the whole sky.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> But Yahweh has taken you, and
brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a
people of inheritance, as at this day.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Furthermore Yahweh was angry with
me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and
that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you
for an inheritance:  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> but I
must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go
over, and possess that good land.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> Take heed to yourselves, lest you
forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make
you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has
forbidden you.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> For Yahweh
your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> When you shall father children,
and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and
shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of
anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
to provoke him to anger;  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off
the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not
prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> Yahweh will scatter you among the
peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where
Yahweh shall lead you away.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> There you shall serve gods, the
work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat,
nor smell.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> But from there
you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search
after him with all your heart and with all your soul.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> When you are in oppression, and
all these things are come on you, in the latter days you shall return to
Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice:  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> for Yahweh your God is a merciful
God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of
your fathers which he swore to them.  <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> For ask now of the days that are
past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the
earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has
been <I>any such thing</I> as this great thing is, or has been heard like
it?  <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> Did ever a people
hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have
heard, and live?  <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> Or has
God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst of <I>another</I>
nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty
hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all
that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?  <a name="C4V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:35</font></a> To you it was shown, that you
might know that Yahweh he is God; there is none else besides him.  <a name="C4V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:36</font></a> Out of heaven he made you to hear
his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you to see his
great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.  <a name="C4V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:37</font></a> Because he loved your fathers,
therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his
presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;  <a name="C4V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:38</font></a> to drive out nations from before
you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land
for an inheritance, as at this day.  <a name="C4V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:39</font></a> Know therefore this day, and lay
it to your heart, that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth
beneath; there is none else.  <a name="C4V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:40</font></a> You shall keep his statutes, and
his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with
you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days
in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.  <a name="C4V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:41</font></a> Then Moses set apart three cities
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;  <a name="C4V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:42</font></a> that the manslayer might flee
there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past;
and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:  <a name="C4V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:43</font></a> <I>namely</I>, Bezer in the
wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in
Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.  <a name="C4V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:44</font></a> This is the law which Moses set
before the children of Israel:  <a name="C4V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:45</font></a> these are the testimonies, and
the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of
Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,  <a name="C4V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:46</font></a> beyond the Jordan, in the valley
over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who
lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they
came forth out of Egypt.  <a name="C4V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:47</font></a> They took his land in possession,
and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;  <a name="C4V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:48</font></a> from Aroer, which is on the edge
of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
 <a name="C4V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:49</font></a> and all the Arabah beyond
the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of
Pisgah.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Moses called to all
Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances
which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe
to do them.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Yahweh our God
made a covenant with us in Horeb.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Yahweh didn't make this covenant
with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this
day.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Yahweh spoke with you
face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> (I stood between Yahweh and you at
that time, to show you the word of Yahweh: for you were afraid because of
the fire, and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> &quot;I am Yahweh your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> You shall have no other gods
before me.
<p> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> &quot;You shall not
make an engraved image for yourself, <I>nor</I> any likeness <I>of
anything</I> that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
that is in the water under the earth:  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> you shall not bow down yourself to
them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the
fourth generation of those who hate me;  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> and showing loving kindness to
thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> &quot;You shall not
take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him
guiltless who takes his name in vain.
<p> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> &quot;Observe the
Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> You shall labor six days, and do
all your work;  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> but the
seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any
work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor
your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your
livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male
servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> You shall remember that you were
a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of
there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your
God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
<p> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> &quot;Honor your
father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days
may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh
your God gives you.
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> &quot;You shall not
murder.
<p> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> &quot;Neither shall
you commit adultery.
<p> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> &quot;Neither shall
you steal.
<p> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> &quot;Neither shall
you give false testimony against your neighbor.
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> &quot;Neither shall
you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's
house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or
his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> These words Yahweh
spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added
no more. He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
 <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> It happened, when you
heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was
burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your
tribes, and your elders;  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> and you said, Behold, Yahweh our
God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice
out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak
with man, and he lives.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Now therefore why should we die?
for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our
God any more, then we shall die.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> For who is there of all flesh,
that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of
the fire, as we have, and lived?  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> Go you near, and hear all that
Yahweh our God shall say: and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God
shall speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> Yahweh heard the voice of your
words, when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice
of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well
said all that they have spoken.  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> Oh that there were such a heart
in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always,
that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> Go tell them, Return you to your
tents.  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> But as for you,
stand you here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandment, and the
statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do
them in the land which I give them to possess it.  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> You shall observe to do therefore
as Yahweh your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the
right hand or to the left.  <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> You shall walk in all the way
which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it
may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which
you shall possess.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Now this is the
commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God
commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go
over to possess it;  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> that
you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his
commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son,
all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Hear therefore, Israel, and
observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase
mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a
land flowing with milk and honey.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God;
Yahweh is one:  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> and you
shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your might.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> These words, which I command you
this day, shall be on your heart;  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> and you shall teach them
diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your
house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you
rise up.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> You shall bind
them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your
eyes.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> You shall write them
on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> It shall be, when Yahweh your God
shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you
didn't build,  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> and houses
full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns dug out,
which you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant,
and you shall eat and be full;  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> then beware lest you forget
Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> You shall
fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his
name.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> You shall not go
after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> for Yahweh your God in the midst
of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled
against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> You shall not tempt Yahweh your
God, as you tempted him in Massah.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> You shall diligently keep the
commandments of Yahweh your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
which he has commanded you.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> You shall do that which is right
and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that
you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your
fathers,  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> to thrust out
all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> When your son asks you in time to
come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you?  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> then you shall tell your son, We
were Pharaoh's bondservants in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand;  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> and
Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh,
and on all his house, before our eyes;  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> and he brought us out from there,
that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our
fathers.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> Yahweh commanded
us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always,
that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> It shall be righteousness to us,
if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has
commanded us.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> When Yahweh your God
shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast
out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> and when Yahweh your God shall
deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall
utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy
to them;  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> neither shall you
make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor
shall you take his daughter for your son.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> For he will turn away your son
from following me, that they may serve other gods: so the anger of Yahweh
would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> But you shall deal with them like
this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces,
and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire.
 <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> For you are a holy people
to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his
own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
 <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Yahweh didn't set his love
on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people;
for you were the fewest of all peoples:  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> but because Yahweh loves you, and
because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh
brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of
bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> Know therefore that Yahweh your
God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness
with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand
generations,  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> and repays
those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to
him who hates him, he will repay him to his face.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> You shall therefore keep the
commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you
this day, to do them.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> It
shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do
them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving
kindness which he swore to your fathers:  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> and he will love you, and bless
you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the
fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the
increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which
he swore to your fathers to give you.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> You shall be blessed above all
peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your
livestock.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> Yahweh will
take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt,
which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who
hate you.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> You shall
consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you; your
eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will
be a snare to you.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> If you
shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I
dispossess them?  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> you
shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what Yahweh your God
did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> the great trials which your eyes
saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the
outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so shall
Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Moreover Yahweh your God will
send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves,
perish from before you.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> You shall not be scared of them;
for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
 <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Yahweh your God will cast
out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume
them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> But Yahweh your God will deliver
them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until
they be destroyed.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> He
will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to
perish from under the sky: there shall no man be able to stand before you,
until you have destroyed them.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> You shall burn the engraved
images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold
that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for
it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> You shall not bring an
abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall
utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted
thing.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> You shall observe to do
all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may live, and
multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your
fathers.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> You shall
remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years
in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what
was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.
 <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> He humbled you, and
allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you didn't know,
neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does
not live by bread only, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth
of Yahweh does man live.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Your clothing didn't grow old on
you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> You shall consider in your heart
that as a man chastens his son, so Yahweh your God chastens you.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> You shall keep the commandments of
Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> For Yahweh your God brings you
into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground
water flowing into valleys and hills;  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> a land of wheat and barley, and
vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
 <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> a land in which you shall
eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land
whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> You shall eat and be full, and
you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you.
 <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Beware lest you forget
Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and
his statutes, which I command you this day:  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> lest, when you have eaten and are
full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein;  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> and when your herds and your
flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that
you have is multiplied;  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> then your heart be lifted up, and
you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage;  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> who led you through the great and
terrible wilderness, <I>in which were</I> fiery serpents and scorpions,
and thirsty ground where there was no water; who brought you forth water
out of the rock of flint;  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> who fed you in the wilderness
with manna, which your fathers didn't know; that he might humble you, and
that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> and <I>lest</I> you say in your
heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
 <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> But you shall remember
Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he
may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
 <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> It shall be, if you shall
forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and
worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.
 <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> As the nations that
Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you
wouldn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Hear, Israel: you are
to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater
and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,
 <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> a people great and tall,
the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who
can stand before the sons of Anak?  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Know therefore this day, that
Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he
will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall
drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to
you.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Don't speak in your
heart, after that Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you,
saying, For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this
land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive them
out from before you.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Not
for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in
to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your
God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the
word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Know therefore,
that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for
your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Remember, don't forget, how you
provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you
went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you
have been rebellious against Yahweh.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh
to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> When I was gone up onto the
mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant
which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and
forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> Yahweh delivered to me the two
tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them <I>was
written</I> according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the
mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> It came to pass at the end of
forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone,
even the tables of the covenant.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you
down quickly from hence; for your people whom you have brought forth out
of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of
the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
 <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> Furthermore Yahweh spoke
to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked
people:  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> let me alone,
that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I
will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> So I turned and came down from
the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables
of the covenant were in my two hands.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> I looked, and behold, you had
sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made you a molten calf: you had
turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
 <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> I took hold of the two
tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your
eyes.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> I fell down before
Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat
bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing
that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
 <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> For I was afraid of the
anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you to
destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Yahweh was very angry with Aaron
to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> I took your sin, the calf which
you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very
small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook
that descended out of the mountain.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> At Taberah, and at Massah, and at
Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh
Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then
you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't
believe him, nor listen to his voice.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> You have been rebellious against
Yahweh from the day that I knew you.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> So I fell down before Yahweh the
forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he
would destroy you.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> I
prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your people and
your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you
have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> Remember your servants, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to
their wickedness, nor to their sin,  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> lest the land whence you brought
us out say, Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which
he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to
kill them in the wilderness.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Yet they are your people and your
inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your
outstretched arm.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> At that time Yahweh
said to me, Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto
the mountain, and make an ark of wood.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> I will write on the tables the
words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put
them in the ark.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> So I
made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first,
and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> He wrote on the tables, according
to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on
the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and
Yahweh gave them to me.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> I
turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark
which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> (The children of Israel traveled
from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his
place.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> From there they
traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of
water.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> At that time
Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his
name, to this day.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Therefore Levi has no portion nor
inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as
Yahweh your God spoke to him.)  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> I stayed on the mountain, as at
the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me
that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Arise, take
your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land,
which I swore to their fathers to give to them.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Now, Israel, what does Yahweh
your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his
ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart
and with all your soul,  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> to keep the commandments of
Yahweh, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?
 <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Behold, to Yahweh your
God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is
therein.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Only Yahweh had
a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after
them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Circumcise therefore the
foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> For Yahweh your God, he is God
of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome,
who doesn't regard persons, nor takes reward.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> He does execute justice for the
fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and
clothing.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Therefore love
the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> You shall fear Yahweh your God;
you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by
his name.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> He is your
praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome
things, which your eyes have seen.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> Your fathers went down into
Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the
stars of the sky for multitude.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Therefore you shall
love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, and his statutes, and his
ordinances, and his commandments, always.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Know you this day: for I don't
speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the
chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
outstretched arm,  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> and his
signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the
king of Egypt, and to all his land;  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> and what he did to the army of
Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of
the <a href="#N3">Red Sea</a> to overflow them as they pursued after you,
and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> and what he did to you in the
wilderness, until you came to this place;  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> and what he did to Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its
mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and
every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> but your eyes have seen all the
great work of Yahweh which he did.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> Therefore you shall keep all the
commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go
in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> and that you may prolong your
days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and
to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> For the land, where you go in to
possess it, isn't as the land of Egypt, from whence you came out, where
you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
 <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> but the land, where you
go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, <I>and</I> drinks
water of the rain of the sky,  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> a land which Yahweh your God
cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the
beginning of the year even to the end of the year.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> It shall happen, if you shall
listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love
Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your
soul,  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> that I will give
the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain,
that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.
 <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> I will give grass in
your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Take heed to yourselves, lest
your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and
worship them;  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> and the
anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that
there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you
perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Therefore you shall lay up these
my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a
sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
 <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> You shall teach them
your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you
walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> You shall write them on the door
posts of your house, and on your gates;  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> that your days may be
multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore
to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
 <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> For if you shall
diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to
love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
 <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> then will Yahweh drive
out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations
greater and mightier than yourselves.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Every place whereon the sole of
your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon,
from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your
border.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> There shall no
man be able to stand before you: Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you
and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has
spoken to you.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Behold, I
set before you this day a blessing and a curse:  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> the blessing, if you shall
listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this
day;  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> and the curse, if
you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn
aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods,
which you have not known.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> It shall happen, when Yahweh
your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that
you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
 <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Aren't they beyond the
Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the
Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks
of Moreh?  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> For you are to
pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God
gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> You shall observe to do all the
statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> These are the statutes
and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh,
the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that
you live on the earth.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> You shall surely destroy all the
places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods,
on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> and you shall break down
their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim
with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and
you shall destroy their name out of that place.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> You shall not do so to Yahweh
your God.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> But to the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put
his name there, even to his habitation you shall seek, and there you shall
come;  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> and there you shall
bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the
wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,
and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock:  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> and there you shall eat before
Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to,
you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> You shall not do after all the
things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own
eyes;  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> for you haven't yet
come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you.
 <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> But when you go over the
Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit,
and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell
in safety;  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> then it shall
happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his
name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your
burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering
of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> You shall rejoice before Yahweh
your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants,
and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because
he has no portion nor inheritance with you.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> Take heed to yourself that you
don't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> but in the place which Yahweh
shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt
offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Notwithstanding, you may kill
and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul,
according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you: the
unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the
hart.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> Only you shall not
eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> You may not eat within your
gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the
firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you
vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
 <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> but you shall eat them
before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose,
you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your
female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall
rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to.  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> Take heed to yourself that you
don't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> When Yahweh your God shall
enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat
flesh, because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, after
all the desire of your soul.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> If the place which Yahweh your
God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you
shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as
I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the
desire of your soul.  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> Even as the gazelle and as the
hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat
of it alike.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Only be
sure that you don't eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you
shall not eat the life with the flesh.  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> You shall not eat it; you shall
pour it out on the earth as water.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> You shall not eat it; that it
may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do
that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> Only your holy things which you
have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which Yahweh
shall choose:  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> and you
shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of
Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on
the altar of Yahweh your God; and you shall eat the flesh.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> Observe and hear all these words
which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children
after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of
Yahweh your God.  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> When
Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in
to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;
 <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> take heed to yourself
that you not be ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed
from before you; and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, How do
these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> You shall not do so to Yahweh
your God: for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done
to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the
fire to their gods.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Whatever thing I command you,
that you shall observe to do: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from
it.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> If there arise in the
midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or
a wonder,  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> and the sign or
the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after
other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> you shall not listen to the words
of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for Yahweh your God proves
you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with
all your soul.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> You shall
walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and
obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cleave to him.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> That prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against
Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which
Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall put away the evil
from the midst of you.
<p> <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> If your brother, the
son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your
bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly,
saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor
your fathers;  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> of the gods
of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from
the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> you shall not consent to him, nor
listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare,
neither shall you conceal him:  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> but you shall surely kill him;
your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the
hand of all the people.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> You shall stone him to death
with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
 <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> All Israel shall hear,
and fear, and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the
midst of you.
<p> <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> If you shall hear
tell concerning one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to
dwell there, saying,  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Certain base fellows are gone
out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their
city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
 <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> then you shall inquire,
and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the
thing certain, that such abomination is done in the midst of you,  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> you shall surely strike the
inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it
utterly, and all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the
sword.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> You shall gather
all its spoil into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the
city, and all its spoil every whit, to Yahweh your God: and it shall be a
heap forever; it shall not be built again.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> There shall cleave nothing of
the devoted thing to your hand; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness
of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply
you, as he has sworn to your fathers;  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> when you shall listen to the
voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you
this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> You are the children
of Yahweh your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness
between your eyes for the dead.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> For you are a holy people to
Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own
possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> You shall not eat any abominable
thing.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> These are the
animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> the hart, and the gazelle, and
the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the
chamois.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> Every animal
that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two, <I>and</I> chews the
cud, among the animals, that may you eat.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Nevertheless these you shall not
eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the
camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't
part the hoof, they are unclean to you.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> The pig, because it has a split
hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall
not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> These you may eat of all that are
in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat;  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> and whatever doesn't have fins
and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Of all clean birds you may eat.
 <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> But these are they of
which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,
 <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> and the red kite, and
the falcon, and the kite after its kind,  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> and every raven after its kind,
 <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> and the ostrich, and the
owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> the little owl, and the great
owl, and the horned owl,  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> and the pelican, and the
vulture, and the cormorant,  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> and the stork, and the heron
after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> All winged creeping things are
unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> Of all clean birds you may eat.
 <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> You shall not eat of
anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living
among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it
to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. You shall
not boil a kid in its mother's milk.  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> You shall surely tithe all the
increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year.
 <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> You shall eat before
Yahweh your God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to
dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to
fear Yahweh your God always.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> If the way is too long for you,
so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from
you, which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there, when
Yahweh your God shall bless you;  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> then you shall turn it into
money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which
Yahweh your God shall choose:  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> and you shall bestow the money
for whatever your soul desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or
for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat
there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your
household.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> The Levite
who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion
nor inheritance with you.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> At the end of every three years
you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and
shall lay it up within your gates:  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> and the Levite, because he has
no portion nor inheritance with you, and the foreigner living among you,
and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,
and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all
the work of your hand which you do.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> At the end of every
seven years you shall make a release.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> This is the manner of the
release: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his
neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because
Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Of a foreigner you may exact it:
but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> However there shall be no poor
with you; (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your
God gives you for an inheritance to possess it;)  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> if only you diligently listen to
the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all this commandment which
I command you this day.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> For Yahweh your God will bless
you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall
not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule
over you.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> If there be
with you a poor man, one of your brothers, within any of your gates in
your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your
heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother;  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> but you shall surely open your
hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need <I>in
that</I> which he wants.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> Beware that there not be a base
thought in your heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is
at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him
nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> You shall surely give him, and
your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for
this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work, and in all
that you put your hand to.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> For the poor will never cease
out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open
your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
 <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> If your brother, a
Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years;
then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> When you let him go free from
you, you shall not let him go empty:  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> you shall furnish him liberally
out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your
winepress; as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
 <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> You shall remember that
you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed
you: therefore I command you this thing today.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> It shall be, if he tell you, I
will not go out from you; because he loves you and your house, because he
is well with you;  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> then
you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he
shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do
likewise.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> It shall not
seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for to the double of
the hire of a hireling has he served you six years: and Yahweh your God
will bless you in all that you do.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> All the firstborn males that are
born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God:
you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the
firstborn of your flock.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> You shall eat it before Yahweh
your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your
household.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> If it have
any blemish, <I>as if it be</I> lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever,
you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> You shall eat it within your
gates: the unclean and the clean <I>shall eat it</I> alike, as the
gazelle, and as the hart.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> Only you shall not eat its
blood; you shall pour it out on the ground as water.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Observe the month of
Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib
Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> You shall sacrifice the Passover
to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh
shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> You shall eat no leavened bread
with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread
of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that
you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all
the days of your life.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> There shall be no yeast seen with
you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which
you sacrifice the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
 <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> You may not sacrifice the
Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;
 <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> but at the place which
Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you
shall sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the
season that you came forth out of Egypt.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> You shall roast and eat it in the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the
morning, and go to your tents.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Six days you shall eat unleavened
bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your
God; you shall do no work <I>therein</I>.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> You shall count seven weeks to
you: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you
shall begin to number seven weeks.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> You shall keep the feast of
weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your
hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
 <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> and you shall rejoice
before Yahweh your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your
male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your
gates, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in
the midst of you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to
cause his name to dwell there.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> You shall remember that you were
a bondservant in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.
 <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> You shall keep the feast
of tents seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing
floor and from your winepress:  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> and you shall rejoice in your
feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and
your female servant, and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the
fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> You shall keep a feast to Yahweh
your God seven days in the place which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh
your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your
hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> Three times in a year shall all
your males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall
choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and
in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear before Yahweh empty:
 <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> every man shall give as
he is able, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has
given you.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> You shall
make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives
you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with
righteous judgment.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> You
shall not wrest justice: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you
take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the
words of the righteous.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> You shall follow that which is
altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your
God gives you.  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> You shall
not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh
your God, which you shall make you.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> Neither shall you set yourself
up a pillar; which Yahweh your God hates.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> You shall not
sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish,
<I>or</I> anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
 <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> If there be found in the
midst of you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you,
man or woman, who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
in transgressing his covenant,  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> and has gone and served other
gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of
the sky, which I have not commanded;  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> and it be told you, and you have
heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true,
and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> then you shall bring forth that
man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the
man or the woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> At the mouth of two witnesses, or
three witnesses, shall he who is to die be put to death; at the mouth of
one witness he shall not be put to death.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> The hand of the witnesses shall
be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the
people. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> If there arise a matter too hard
for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and
between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;
then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall
choose;  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> and you shall
come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those
days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of
judgment.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> You shall do
according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that
place which Yahweh shall choose; and you shall observe to do according to
all that they shall teach you:  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> according to the tenor of the
law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they
shall tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence
which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> The man who does presumptuously,
in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh
your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away
the evil from Israel.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> All the people shall hear, and
fear, and do no more presumptuously.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> When you are come to the land
which Yahweh your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell
therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations
that are around me;  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> you
shall surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your God shall choose: one
from among your brothers you shall set king over you; you may not put a
foreigner over you, who is not your brother.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> Only he shall not multiply
horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end
that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, You shall
henceforth return no more that way.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Neither shall he multiply wives
to himself, that his heart not turn away: neither shall he greatly
multiply to himself silver and gold.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> It shall be, when he sits on the
throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a
book, out of <I>that which is</I> before the priests the Levites:  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> and it shall be with him, and he
shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear
Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to
do them;  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> that his heart
not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the
commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may
prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of
Israel.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> The priests the
Levites, <I>even</I> all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor
inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by
fire, and his inheritance.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> They shall have no inheritance
among their brothers: Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to
them.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> This shall be the
priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it
be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the
two cheeks, and the maw.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> The first fruits of your grain,
of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your
sheep, you shall give him.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> For Yahweh your God has chosen
him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh,
him and his sons for ever.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> If a Levite comes from any of
your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes
with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
 <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> then he shall minister in
the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand
there before Yahweh.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> They
shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of
his patrimony.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> When you
are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not
learn to do after the abominations of those nations.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> There shall not be found with
you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one
who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a
sorcerer,  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> or a charmer,
or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
 <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> For whoever does these
things is an abomination to Yahweh: and because of these abominations
Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> You shall be perfect with Yahweh
your God.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> For these
nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery,
and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to
do.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Yahweh your God will
raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you, of your brothers, like
me. You shall listen to him.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> This is according to all that
you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly,
saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me
see this great fire any more, that I not die.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Yahweh said to me, They have
well said that which they have spoken.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> I will raise them up a prophet
from among their brothers, like you; and I will put my words in his mouth,
and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> It shall happen, that whoever
will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will
require it of him.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> But
the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I
have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other
gods, that same prophet shall die.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> If you say in your heart, How
shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> when a prophet speaks in the
name of Yahweh, if the thing doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing
which Yahweh has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, you
shall not be afraid of him.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> When Yahweh your God
shall cut off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you
succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> you shall set apart three cities
for you in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to
possess it.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> You shall
prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh
your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may
flee there.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> This is the
case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills his
neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past;  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> as when a man goes into the
forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with
the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and
lights on his neighbor, so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these
cities and live:  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> lest the
avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and
overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; whereas he
was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past.
 <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Therefore I command you,
saying, You shall set apart three cities for you.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> If Yahweh your God enlarge your
border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and give you all the land which
he promised to give to your fathers;  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> if you shall keep all this
commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your
God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more
for you, besides these three:  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> that innocent blood not be shed
in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, and so blood be on you.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> But if any man hate his
neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and strike him
mortally so that he dies, and he flee into one of these cities;  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> then the elders of his city
shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the
avenger of blood, that he may die.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> Your eye shall not pity him, but
you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well
with you.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> You shall not
remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your
inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God
gives you to possess it.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> One witness shall not rise up
against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:
at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a
matter be established.  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> If an unrighteous witness rise
up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> then both the men, between whom
the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the
judges who shall be in those days;  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> and the judges shall make
diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and
has testified falsely against his brother;  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> then you shall do to him as he
had thought to do to his brother: so you shall put away the evil from the
midst of you.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> Those who
remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such
evil in the midst of you.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> Your eyes shall not pity; life
<I>shall go</I> for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
foot for foot.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> When you go forth to
battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, <I>and</I> a
people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God
is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> It shall be, when you draw near
to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
 <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> and shall tell them,
Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: don't
let your heart faint; don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of
them;  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> for Yahweh your God
is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save
you.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> The officers shall
speak to the people, saying, What man is there who has built a new house,
and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die
in the battle, and another man dedicate it.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> What man is there who has planted
a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> What man is there who has pledged
to be married a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> The officers shall speak further
to the people, and they shall say, What man is there who is fearful and
faint-hearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brother's
heart melt as his heart.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> It shall be, when the officers
have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint
captains of armies at the head of the people.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> When you draw near to a city to
fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> It shall be, if it make you
answer of peace, and open to you, then it shall be, that all the people
who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
 <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> If it will make no peace
with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:
 <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> and when Yahweh your God
delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the
edge of the sword:  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> but
the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the
city, even all its spoil, you shall take for a prey to yourself; and you
shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
 <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Thus you shall do to all
the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of
these nations.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> But of
the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> but you shall utterly destroy
them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the
Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you;  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> that they not teach you to do
after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would
you sin against Yahweh your God.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> When you shall besiege a city a
long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its
trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you
shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should
be besieged of you?  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> Only
the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall
destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city
that makes war with you, until it fall.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> If one be found slain
in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it, lying in the
field, and it isn't known who has struck him;  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> then your elders and your judges
shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around
him who is slain:  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> and it
shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders
of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn't been worked
with, and which has not drawn in the yoke;  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> and the elders of that city shall
bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither
plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
 <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> The priests the sons of
Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to
him, and to bless in the name of Yahweh; and according to their word shall
every controversy and every stroke be.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> All the elders of that city, who
are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose
neck was broken in the valley;  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> and they shall answer and say,
Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> Forgive, Yahweh, your people
Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow innocent blood <I>to
remain</I> in the midst of your people Israel. The blood shall be forgiven
them.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> So you shall put
away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that
which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> When you go forth to battle
against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands,
and you carry them away captive,  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> and see among the captives a
beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you
as wife;  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> then you shall
bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her
nails;  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> and she shall put
the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your
house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that
you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
 <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> It shall be, if you have
no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall
not sell her at all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,
because you have humbled her.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> If a man have two wives, the one
beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the
beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
 <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> then it shall be, in the
day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not
make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who
is the firstborn:  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> but he
shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a
double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his
strength; the right of the firstborn is his.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> If a man have a stubborn and
rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of
his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them;  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> then shall his father and his
mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and
to the gate of his place;  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> and they shall tell the elders
of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our
voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> All the men of his city shall
stone him to death with stones: so you shall put away the evil from the
midst of you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> If a man have committed a sin
worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
 <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> his body shall not
remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day;
for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don't defile your land
which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> You shall not see your
brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you
shall surely bring them again to your brother.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> If your brother isn't near to
you, or if you don't know him, then you shall bring it home to your house,
and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall
restore it to him.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> So you
shall do with his donkey; and so you shall do with his garment; and so you
shall do with every lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and
you have found: you may not hide yourself.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> You shall not see your brother's
donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you
shall surely help him to lift them up again.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> A woman shall not wear men's
clothing, neither shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever does
these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> If a bird's nest chance to be
before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or
eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take
the hen with the young:  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> you shall surely let the hen go,
but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and
that you may prolong your days.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> When you build a new house, then
you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you don't bring blood on
your house, if any man fall from there.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> You shall not sow your vineyard
with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which
you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> You shall not plow with an ox
and a donkey together.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> You shall not wear a mixed
stuff, wool and linen together.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> You shall make yourselves <a
href="#N4">fringes</a> on the four borders of your cloak, with which you
cover yourself.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> If any
man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> and accuses her of shameful
things, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, I took this woman,
and when I came near to her, I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;
 <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> then shall the father of
the young lady, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the
young lady's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate;  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> and the young lady's father
shall tell the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he
hates her;  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> and behold,
he has accused her of shameful things, saying, I didn't find in your
daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my
daughter's virginity. They shall spread the garment before the elders of
the city.  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> The elders of
that city shall take the man and chastise him;  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> and they shall fine him one
hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and give them to the father of the young
lady, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and
she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.  <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> But if this thing be true, that
the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady;  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> then they shall bring out the
young lady to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city
shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in
Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house: so you shall put
away the evil from the midst of you.  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> If a man be found lying with a
woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who
lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from
Israel.  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> If there be a
young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man
find her in the city, and lie with her;  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> then you shall bring them both
out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with
stones; the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city; and the man,
because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away the evil
from the midst of you.  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> But if the man find the lady who
is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with
her; then the man only who lay with her shall die:  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> but to the lady you shall do
nothing; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death: for as when a man
rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> for he found her in the field,
the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was none to save her.
 <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> If a man find a lady who
is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and
lie with her, and they be found;  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> then the man who lay with her
shall give to the lady's father fifty <I>shekels</I> of silver, and she
shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all
his days.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> A man shall
not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> He who is wounded in
the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the
assembly of Yahweh.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> A
bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth
generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> An Ammonite or a Moabite shall
not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall
none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> because they didn't meet you with
bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and
because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of
Mesopotamia, to curse you.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Nevertheless Yahweh your God
wouldn't listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a
blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> You shall not seek their peace
nor their prosperity all your days forever.  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> You shall not abhor an Edomite;
for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived
as a foreigner in his land.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> The children of the third
generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
 <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> When you go forth in camp
against your enemies, then you shall keep you from every evil thing.
 <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> If there be among you
any man, who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night,
then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the
camp:  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> but it shall be,
when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun
is down, he shall come within the camp.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> You shall have a place also
outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad:  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> and you shall have a paddle
among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall
dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:
 <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> for Yahweh your God
walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your
enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see
an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> You shall not deliver to his
master a servant who is escaped from his master to you:  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> he shall dwell with you, in the
midst of you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates,
where it pleases him best: you shall not oppress him.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> There shall be no prostitute of
the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of
Israel.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> You shall not
bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a dog, into the house of
Yahweh your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to
Yahweh your God.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> You
shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of
food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> to a foreigner you may lend on
interest; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh
your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where
you go in to possess it.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> When you shall vow a vow to
Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for Yahweh your God
will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> But if you shall forbear to vow,
it shall be no sin in you.  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> That which is gone out of your
lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your
God, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth.  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> When you come into your
neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own
pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> When you come into your
neighbor's standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but
you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> When a man takes a
wife, and marries her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes,
because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a
bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
 <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> When she is departed out
of his house, she may go and be another man's <I>wife</I>.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> If the latter husband hate her,
and write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out
of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
 <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> her former husband, who
sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is
defiled; for that is abomination before Yahweh: and you shall not cause
the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
 <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> When a man takes a new
wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any
business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom
he has taken.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> No man
shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he takes <I>a
man's</I> life to pledge.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> If a man be found stealing any of
his brothers of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave,
or sell him; then that thief shall die: so you shall put away the evil
from the midst of you.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> Take heed in the plague of
leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the
priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall
observe to do.  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> Remember
what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came forth out of
Egypt.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> When you do lend
your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall not go into his house to get
his pledge.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> You shall
stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the
pledge outside to you.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> If he be a poor man, you shall
not sleep with his pledge;  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> you shall surely restore to him
the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and
bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
 <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> You shall not oppress a
hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of
your foreigners who are in your land within your gates:  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> in his day you shall give him
his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets
his heart on it: lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
 <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> The fathers shall not be
put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death
for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> You shall not wrest the justice
<I>due</I> to the foreigner, <I>or</I> to the fatherless, nor take the
widow's clothing to pledge;  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> but you shall remember that you
were a bondservant in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you there:
therefore I command you to do this thing.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> When you reap your harvest in
your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again
to get it: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the
widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
 <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> When you beat your olive
tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the
foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> When you gather <I>the grapes
of</I> your vineyard, you shall not glean it after you: it shall be for
the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> You shall remember that you were
a bondservant in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this
thing.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> If there be a
controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and <I>the judges</I>
judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked;
 <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> and it shall be, if the
wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie
down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by
number.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Forty stripes he
may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him
above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.
 <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> You shall not muzzle the
ox when he treads out <I>the grain</I>.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> If brothers dwell together, and
one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be
married outside to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her,
and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother
to her.  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> It shall be, that
the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who
is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> If the man doesn't want to take
his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the
elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a
name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.
 <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> Then the elders of his
city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he stand, and say, I don't
want to take her;  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> then
his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and
loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall
answer and say, So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his
brother's house.  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> His
name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has his shoe untied.
 <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> When men strive together
one with another, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her
husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand,
and takes him by the secrets;  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> then you shall cut off her hand,
your eye shall have no pity.  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> You shall not have in your bag
diverse weights, a great and a small.  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> You shall not have in your house
diverse measures, a great and a small.  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> You shall have a perfect and
just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may
be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> For all who do such things,
<I>even</I> all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to Yahweh your
God.  <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> Remember what
Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth out of Egypt;  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> how he met you by the way, and
struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were
faint and weary; and he didn't fear God.  <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> Therefore it shall be, when
Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in
the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky; you shall
not forget.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> It shall be, when you
are come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein,  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> that you shall take of the first
of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land
that Yahweh your God gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and
shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his
name to dwell there.  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> You
shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, I
profess this day to Yahweh your God, that I am come to the land which
Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us.  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> The priest shall take the basket
out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
 <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> You shall answer and say
before Yahweh your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he
went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became
there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> The Egyptians dealt ill with us,
and afflicted us, and laid on us hard bondage:  <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> and we cried to Yahweh, the God
of our fathers, and Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and
our toil, and our oppression;  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> and Yahweh brought us forth out
of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great
terror, and with signs, and with wonders;  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> and he has brought us into this
place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
 <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> Now, behold, I have
brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, Yahweh, have
given me. You shall set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship before
Yahweh your God.  <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> You
shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and
to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is in the midst
of you.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> When you have
made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year,
which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the
foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within
your gates, and be filled.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> You shall say before Yahweh your
God, I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given
them to the Levite, and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the
widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me: I
have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten
them:  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> I have not eaten
of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor
given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I
have done according to all that you have commanded me.  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> Look down from your holy
habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground
which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with
milk and honey.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> This day
Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances: you
shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your
soul.  <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> You have declared
Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would walk in his ways, and
keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and listen to
his voice:  <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> and Yahweh
has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession, as he has
promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;  <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> and to make you high above all
nations that he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that
you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> Moses and the elders
of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I
command you this day.  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> It
shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which
Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones,
and plaster them with plaster:  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> and you shall write on them all
the words of this law, when you are passed over; that you may go in to the
land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> It shall be, when you are passed
over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you
this day, in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> There you shall build an altar to
Yahweh your God, an altar of stones: you shall lift up no iron <I>tool</I>
on them.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> You shall build
the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones; and you shall offer burnt
offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> and you shall sacrifice peace
offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your
God.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> You shall write on
the stones all the words of this law very plainly.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> Moses and the priests the Levites
spoke to all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and listen, Israel: this day
you are become the people of Yahweh your God.  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> You shall therefore obey the
voice of Yahweh your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which
I command you this day.  <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> Moses commanded the people the
same day, saying,  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> These
shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are passed over
the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and
Benjamin.  <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> These shall
stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun,
Dan, and Naphtali.  <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> The
Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
 <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> Cursed be the man who
makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to Yahweh, the work of
the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. All the people shall
answer and say, Amen.  <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> Cursed be he who sets light by
his father or his mother. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> Cursed be he who removes his
neighbor's landmark. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> Cursed be he who makes the blind
to wander out of the way. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> Cursed be he who wrests the
justice <I>due</I> to the foreigner, fatherless, and widow. All the people
shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> Cursed
be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his
father's skirt. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> Cursed be he who lies with any
manner of animal. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> Cursed be he who lies with his
sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. All the
people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:23</font></a> Cursed be he who lies with his
mother-in-law. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:24</font></a> Cursed be he who strikes his
neighbor in secret. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:25</font></a> Cursed be he who takes a bribe
to kill an innocent person. All the people shall say, Amen.  <a name="C27V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:26</font></a> Cursed be he who doesn't confirm
the words of this law to do them. All the people shall say, Amen.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> It shall happen, if
you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to
do all his commandments which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God
will set you on high above all the nations of the earth:  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> and all these blessings shall
come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh
your God.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> You shall be
blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> You shall be blessed in the fruit
of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the
increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> Your basket and your kneading
trough shall be blessed.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> You shall be blessed when you
come in, and you shall be blessed when you go out.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Yahweh will cause your enemies
who rise up against you to be struck before you. They will come out
against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> Yahweh will command the blessing
on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and he will
bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> Yahweh will establish you for a
holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the
commandments of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways.  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> All the peoples of the earth
shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be
afraid of you.  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> Yahweh
will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body, and in the
fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land
which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you.  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> Yahweh will open to you his good
treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to
bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and
you shall not borrow.  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> Yahweh will make you the head,
and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be
beneath; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which
I command you this day, to observe and to do <I>them</I>,  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> and shall not turn aside from
any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to
the left, to go after other gods to serve them.  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> But it shall come to pass, if
you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all
his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, that all
these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.  <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> You shall be cursed in the city,
and you shall be cursed in the field.  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> Your basket and your kneading
trough shall be cursed.  <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> The fruit of your body, the
fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of
your flock shall be cursed.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> You shall be cursed when you
come in, and you shall be cursed when you go out.  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> Yahweh will send on you cursing,
confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are
destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your
doings, by which you have forsaken me.  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> Yahweh will make the pestilence
cleave to you, until he has consumed you from off the land, where you go
in to possess it.  <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> Yahweh
will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation,
and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew;
and they shall pursue you until you perish.  <a name="C28V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:23</font></a> Your sky that is over your head
shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.  <a name="C28V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:24</font></a> Yahweh will make the rain of
your land powder and dust: from the sky shall it come down on you, until
you are destroyed.  <a name="C28V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:25</font></a> Yahweh will cause you to be
struck before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and
shall flee seven ways before them: and you shall be tossed back and forth
among all the kingdoms of the earth.  <a name="C28V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:26</font></a> Your dead body shall be food to
all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be
none to frighten them away.  <a name="C28V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:27</font></a> Yahweh will strike you with the
boil of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scurvy, and with the
itch, of which you can not be healed.  <a name="C28V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:28</font></a> Yahweh will strike you with
madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;  <a name="C28V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:29</font></a> and you shall grope at noonday,
as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:
and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none
to save you.  <a name="C28V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:30</font></a> You shall
betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build a
house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and
shall not use its fruit.  <a name="C28V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:31</font></a> Your ox shall be slain before
your eyes, and you shall not eat of it: your donkey shall be violently
taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your
sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you.
 <a name="C28V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:32</font></a> Your sons and your
daughters shall be given to another people; and your eyes shall look, and
fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nothing in the
power of your hand.  <a name="C28V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:33</font></a> The
fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation which you don't
know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always;  <a name="C28V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:34</font></a> so that you shall be mad for the
sight of your eyes which you shall see.  <a name="C28V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:35</font></a> Yahweh will strike you in the
knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed,
from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.  <a name="C28V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:36</font></a> Yahweh will bring you, and your
king whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you
nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone.
 <a name="C28V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:37</font></a> You shall become an
astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh
shall lead you away.  <a name="C28V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:38</font></a> You
shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in; for
the locust shall consume it.  <a name="C28V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:39</font></a> You shall plant vineyards and
dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather <I>the
grapes</I>; for the worm shall eat them.  <a name="C28V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:40</font></a> You shall have olive trees
throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the
oil; for your olive shall cast <I>its fruit</I>.  <a name="C28V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:41</font></a> You shall father sons and
daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
 <a name="C28V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:42</font></a> All your trees and the
fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.  <a name="C28V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:43</font></a> The foreigner who is in the
midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher; and you shall
come down lower and lower.  <a name="C28V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:44</font></a> He shall lend to you, and you
shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
 <a name="C28V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:45</font></a> All these curses shall
come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, until you are
destroyed; because you didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to
keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:  <a name="C28V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:46</font></a> and they shall be on you for a
sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever.  <a name="C28V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:47</font></a> Because you didn't serve Yahweh
your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the
abundance of all things;  <a name="C28V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:48</font></a> therefore you shall serve your
enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and
in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
on your neck, until he have destroyed you.  <a name="C28V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:49</font></a> Yahweh will bring a nation
against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a
nation whose language you shall not understand;  <a name="C28V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:50</font></a> a nation of fierce facial
expressions, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor
to the young,  <a name="C28V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:51</font></a> and shall
eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you
are destroyed; that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the
increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have
caused you to perish.  <a name="C28V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:52</font></a> They shall besiege you in all
your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you
trusted, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your
gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God has given you.
 <a name="C28V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:53</font></a> You shall eat the fruit
of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom
Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which
your enemies shall distress you.  <a name="C28V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:54</font></a> The man who is tender among you,
and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward
the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has
remaining;  <a name="C28V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:55</font></a> so that he
will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall
eat, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress
with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.  <a name="C28V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:56</font></a> The tender and delicate woman
among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the
ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,  <a name="C28V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:57</font></a> and toward her young one who
comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall
bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege
and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your
gates.  <a name="C28V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:58</font></a> If you will not
observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book,
that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;  <a name="C28V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:59</font></a> then Yahweh will make your
plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and
of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.  <a name="C28V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:60</font></a> He will bring on you again all
the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to
you.  <a name="C28V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:61</font></a> Also every
sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law,
them will Yahweh bring on you, until you are destroyed.  <a name="C28V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:62</font></a> You shall be left few in number,
whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn't
listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.  <a name="C28V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:63</font></a> It shall happen that as Yahweh
rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will
rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall
be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it.  <a name="C28V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:64</font></a> Yahweh will scatter you among
all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the
earth; and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known, you
nor your fathers, even wood and stone.  <a name="C28V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:65</font></a> Among these nations you shall
find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but
Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and
pining of soul;  <a name="C28V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:66</font></a> and your
life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and
shall have no assurance of your life.  <a name="C28V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:67</font></a> In the morning you shall say,
Would it were even! and at even you shall say, Would it were morning! for
the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your
eyes which you shall see.  <a name="C28V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:68</font></a> Yahweh will bring you into Egypt
again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no
more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for
bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> These are the words of
the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of
Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them
in Horeb.  <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> Moses called to
all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that Yahweh did before
your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to
all his land;  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> the great
trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> but Yahweh has not given you a
heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.  <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> I have led you forty years in the
wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not
grown old on your foot.  <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> You have not eaten bread, neither
have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh
your God.  <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> When you came
to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came
out against us to battle, and we struck them:  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> and we took their land, and gave
it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the
half-tribe of the Manassites.  <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> Keep therefore the words of this
covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.  <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> You stand this day all of you
before Yahweh your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your
officers, even all the men of Israel,  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> your little ones, your wives,
and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who
cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;  <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> that you may enter into the
covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath, which Yahweh your God
makes with you this day;  <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> that he may establish you this
day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke
to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob.  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> Neither with you
only do I make this covenant and this oath,  <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> but with him who stands here
with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with him who is not here
with us this day  <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> (for
you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the
midst of the nations through which you passed;  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> and you have seen their
abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were
among them);  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> lest there
should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns
away this day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those
nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and
wormwood;  <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> and it happen,
when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart,
saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,
to destroy the moist with the dry.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> Yahweh will not pardon him, but
then the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and
all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and Yahweh
will blot out his name from under the sky.  <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> Yahweh will set him apart to
evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the
covenant that is written in this book of the law.  <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> The generation to come, your
children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come
from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick;  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> <I>and that</I> the whole land
of it is sulfur, and salt, <I>and</I> a burning, <I>that</I> it is not
sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom
and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and
in his wrath:  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> even all
the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? what means
the heat of this great anger?  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> Then men shall say, Because they
forsook the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made
with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,  <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> and went and served other gods,
and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that he had not given
to them:  <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> therefore the
anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the
curse that is written in this book;  <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> and Yahweh rooted them out of
their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them
into another land, as at this day.  <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> The secret things belong to
Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our
children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> It shall happen, when
all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have
set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations,
where Yahweh your God has driven you,  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> and shall return to Yahweh your
God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this
day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
 <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> that then Yahweh your God
will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and
gather you from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
 <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> If <I>any of</I> your
outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will Yahweh
your God gather you, and from there he will bring you back:  <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> and Yahweh your God will bring
you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it;
and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> Yahweh your God will circumcise
your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> Yahweh your God will put all
these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted
you.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> You shall return and
obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you
this day.  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> Yahweh your God
will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your
body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,
for good: for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced
over your fathers;  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> if
you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and
his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to
Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.  <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> For this commandment which I
command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.
 <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> It is not in heaven,
that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us,
and make us to hear it, that we may do it?  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> Neither is it beyond the sea,
that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us,
and make us to hear it, that we may do it?  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> But the word is very near to
you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> Behold, I have set before you
this day life and good, and death and evil;  <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> in that I command you this day
to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments
and his statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and
that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess
it.  <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> But if your heart
turn away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship
other gods, and serve them;  <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> I denounce to you this day, that
you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land,
where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.  <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death,
the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you
and your seed;  <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> to love
Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him; for he is your
life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which
Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
them.
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> Moses went and spoke
these words to all Israel.  <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> He said to them, I am one hundred
twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Yahweh
has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> Yahweh your God, he will go over
before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall
dispossess them: <I>and</I> Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh
has spoken.  <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> Yahweh will
do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to
their land; whom he destroyed.  <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> Yahweh will deliver them up
before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment
which I have commanded you.  <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> Be strong and of good courage,
don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for Yahweh your God, he it is who
does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> Moses called to Joshua, and said
to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for you
shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their
fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.  <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> Yahweh, he it is who does go
before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake
you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.  <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> Moses wrote this law, and
delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel.  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> Moses commanded them, saying, At
the end of <I>every</I> seven years, in the set time of the year of
release, in the feast of tents,  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> when all Israel is come to
appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose, you
shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.  <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> Assemble the people, the men and
the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your
gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your
God, and observe to do all the words of this law;  <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> and that their children, who
have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as
you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.  <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Behold,
your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves
in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him. Moses and Joshua went,
and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a
pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
 <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up,
and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go
to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
made with them.  <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> Then my
anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them,
and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many
evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,
Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?  <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> I will surely hide my face in
that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are
turned to other gods.  <a name="C31V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:19</font></a> Now therefore write you this
song for you, and teach you it the children of Israel: put it in their
mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of
Israel.  <a name="C31V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:20</font></a> For when I shall
have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing
with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and
grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise
me, and break my covenant.  <a name="C31V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:21</font></a> It shall happen, when many evils
and troubles are come on them, that this song shall testify before them as
a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have
brought them into the land which I swore.  <a name="C31V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:22</font></a> So Moses wrote this song the
same day, and taught it the children of Israel.  <a name="C31V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:23</font></a> He commissioned Joshua the son
of Nun, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the
children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with
you.  <a name="C31V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:24</font></a> It happened, when
Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until
they were finished,  <a name="C31V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:25</font></a> that
Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
saying,  <a name="C31V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:26</font></a> Take this book
of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.  <a name="C31V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:27</font></a> For I know your rebellion, and
your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have
been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?  <a name="C31V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:28</font></a> Assemble to me all the elders of
your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their
ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.  <a name="C31V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:29</font></a> For I know that after my death
you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I
have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days;
because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
him to anger through the work of your hands.  <a name="C31V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:30</font></a> Moses spoke in the ears of all
the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.

an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;  <a name="C32V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:46</font></a> He said to them, Set your heart
to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command
your children to observe to do, <I>even</I> all the words of this law.
 <a name="C32V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:47</font></a> For it is no vain thing
for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong
your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.  <a name="C32V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:48</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses that same
day, saying,  <a name="C32V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:49</font></a> Go up into
this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that
is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the
children of Israel for a possession;  <a name="C32V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:50</font></a> and die on the mountain where
you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on
Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:  <a name="C32V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:51</font></a> because you trespassed against
me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of
Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the
midst of the children of Israel.  <a name="C32V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:52</font></a> For you shall see the land
before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the
children of Israel.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> This is the blessing,
with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his
death.  <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> He said,
<dl>
<dt>Yahweh came from Sinai,
<dd>And rose from Seir to them.
<dt>He shone forth from Mount Paran.
<dd>He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.
<dd>At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
<dt> <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> Yes, he loves the
people.
<dd>All his saints are in your hand.
<dd>They sat down at your feet;

<p> <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> This is <I>the

<dd>Bring him in to his people.
<dt>With his hands he contended for himself.
<dd>You shall be a help against his adversaries.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> Of Levi he said,
<dl>
<dt>Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,
<dd>whom you proved at Massah,
<dd>with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah;
<dt> <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> who said of his
father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
<dd>Neither did he acknowledge his brothers,
<dd>Nor did he know his own children:
<dt>For they have observed your word,
<dd>and keep your covenant.
<dt> <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> They shall teach
Jacob your ordinances,

<dd>of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> Of Benjamin he said,

<dd>He covers him all the day long.
<dd>He dwells between his shoulders.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> Of Joseph he said,

<dd>for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew,
<dd>for the deep that couches beneath,

<dt> <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> The firstborn of his

</dl>
<p> <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> Of Zebulun he said,

</dl>
<p> <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> Of Gad he said,

<dt>He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
<dd>He dwells as a lioness,

<dt> <a name="C33V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:21</font></a> He provided the

<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> Moses went up from the
plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against
Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,  <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> and all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
 <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> and the South, and the
Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.  <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> Yahweh said to him, This is the
land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give
it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall
not go over there.  <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> So
Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to
the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> He
buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but
no man knows of his tomb to this day.  <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> Moses was one hundred twenty
years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
 <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> The children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping
in the mourning for Moses were ended.  <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> Joshua the son of Nun was full of
the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the
children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
 <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> There has not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,  <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> in all the signs and the
wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and
to all his servants, and to all his land,  <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> and in all the mighty hand, and
in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.

<p>This file should be named web0510h.htm or web0510h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web0510ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>
