<h1>
The Letter to the Hebrews
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> God, having in the past
spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various
ways,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> has at the end of
these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things,
through whom also he made the worlds.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> His Son is the radiance of his
glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the
word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins,
sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> having become so much better than
the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.
 <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> For to which of the angels
did he say at any time, 
<dl>
<dt>&quot;You are my Son.
<dd>Today have I become your father?&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>and again, 
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I will be to him a Father,
<dd>and he will be to me a Son?&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Again, when he brings
in the firstborn into the world he says, &quot;Let all the angels of God
worship him.&quot;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Of the
angels he says,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Who makes his angels winds,
<dd>and his servants a flame of fire.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But of the Son he says,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
<dd>The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> You have loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity;
<dd>therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
above your fellows.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> And,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
<dd>The heavens are the works of your hands.
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> They will perish, but
you continue.
<dd>They all will grow old like a garment does.
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> As a mantle, you will
roll them up,
<dd>and they will be changed;
<dt>but you are the same.
<dd>Your years will not fail.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> But which of the
angels has he told at any time,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Sit at my right hand,
<dd>until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Aren't they all
serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will
inherit salvation?
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Therefore we ought to
pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift
away.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> For if the word
spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense;  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> how will we escape if we neglect
so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the
Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> God also testifying with them,
both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the
Holy Spirit, according to his own will?  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For he didn't subject the world to
come, of which we speak, to angels.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But one has somewhere testified,
saying,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;What is man, that you think of him?
<dd>Or the son of man, that you care for him?
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> You made him a little
lower than the angels.
<dd>You crowned him with glory and honor.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<dd> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> You have put all
things in subjection under his feet.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not
subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> But we see him who has
been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering
of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should
taste of death for everyone.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For it became him, for whom are
all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to
glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
 <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For both he who
sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause
he is not ashamed to call them <a href="#N9">brothers</a>,  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> saying,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I will declare your name to my brothers.
<dd>In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N10">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Again, &quot;I will
put my trust in him.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N11">*</a></sup></font> Again, &quot;Behold, here I am with the
children whom God has given me.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Since then the children have
shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the
same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power
of death, that is, the devil,  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> and might deliver all of them who
through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> For most certainly, he doesn't
give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Therefore he was obligated in all
things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and
faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for
the sins of the people.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> For in that he himself has
suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Therefore, holy
brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High
Priest of our confession, Jesus;  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> who was faithful to him who
appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> For he has been counted worthy of
more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor
than the house.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> For every
house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Moses indeed was faithful in all
his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were
afterward to be spoken,  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> but Christ is faithful as a Son
over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the
glorying of our hope firm to the end.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit
says, 
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Today if you will hear his voice,
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> don't harden your
hearts, as in the provocation,
<dd>like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> where your fathers
tested me by proving me,
<dd>and saw my works for forty years.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Therefore I was
displeased with that generation,
<dd>and said, 'They always err in their heart,
<dd>but they didn't know my ways;'
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> as I swore in my
wrath,
<dd>'They will not enter into my rest.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Beware, brothers, lest
perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling
away from the living God;  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> but exhort one another day by
day, so long as it is called &quot;today;&quot; lest any one of you be
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> For we have become partakers of
Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:
 <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> while it is said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Today if you will hear his voice,
<dd>don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N14">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> For who, when they
heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?
 <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> With whom was he
displeased forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell
in the wilderness?  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> To
whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who
were disobedient?  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> We see
that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Let us fear therefore,
lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of
entering into his rest.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> For indeed we have had good news
preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't
profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.
 <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For we who have believed
do enter into that rest, even as he has said, &quot;As I swore in my
wrath, they will not enter into my rest;&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font> although the works were
finished from the foundation of the world.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> For he has said this somewhere
about the seventh day, &quot;God rested on the seventh day from all his
works;&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N16">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> and in this place again,
&quot;They will not enter into my rest.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Seeing therefore it
remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was
before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> he again defines a certain day,
today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been
said),
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Today if you will hear his voice,
<dd>don't harden your hearts.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N18">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> For if Joshua had given
them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> There remains therefore a Sabbath
rest for the people of God.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> For he who has entered into his
rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Let us therefore give diligence
to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of
disobedience.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> For the
word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword,
and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and
marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> There is no creature
that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open
before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Having then a great high priest,
who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold
tightly to our confession.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For we don't have a high priest
who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has
been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Let us therefore draw near with
boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find
grace for help in time of need.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> For every high priest,
being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to
God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> The high priest can deal gently
with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also
surrounded with weakness.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Because of this, he must offer
sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Nobody takes this honor on
himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> So also Christ didn't glorify
himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;You are my Son.
<dd>Today I have become your father.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N19">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> As he says also in
another place,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;You are a priest forever,
<dd>after the order of Melchizedek.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> He, in the days of his
flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and
tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard
for his godly fear,  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> though
he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
 <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Having been made perfect,
he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,
 <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> named by God a high
priest after the order of Melchizedek.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> About him we have many words to
say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.
 <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> For when by reason of the
time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you
the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come
to need milk, and not solid food.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> For everyone who lives on milk is
not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> But solid food is for those who
are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
discern good and evil.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Therefore leaving the
doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to
perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works,
of faith toward God,  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> of
the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the
dead, and of eternal judgment.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> This will we do, if God permits.
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> For concerning those who
were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
partakers of the Holy Spirit,  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> and tasted the good word of God,
and the powers of the age to come,  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> and then fell away, it is
impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son
of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> For the land which has drunk the
rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for
whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> but if it bears thorns and
thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> But, beloved, we are
persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation,
even though we speak like this.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> For God is not unrighteous, so as
to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his
name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> We desire that each one of you
may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
 <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> that you won't be
sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited
the promises.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> For when
God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he
swore by himself,  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> saying,
&quot;Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply
you.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N21">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Thus, having patiently endured,
he obtained the promise.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> For men indeed swear by a greater
one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
 <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> In this way God, being
determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the
immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> that by two immutable things, in
which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement,
who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> This hope we have as an anchor of
the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is
within the veil;  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> where as
a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever
after the order of Melchizedek.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> For this Melchizedek,
king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings and blessed him,  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> to whom also Abraham divided a
tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness,
and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> without father, without mother,
without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but
made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Now consider how great this man
was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best
spoils.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> They indeed of the
sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take
tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers,
though these have come out of the body of Abraham,  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> but he whose genealogy is not
counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him
who has the promises.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> But
without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Here people who die receive
tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he
lives.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> We can say that
through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> for he was yet in the body of his
father when Melchizedek met him.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Now if there was perfection
through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received
the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after
the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> For the priesthood being
changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> For he of whom these things are
said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the
altar.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> For it is evident
that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke
nothing concerning priesthood.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> This is yet more abundantly
evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> who has been made, not
after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless
life:  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> for it is testified,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;You are a priest forever,
<dd>according to the order of Melchizedek.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N22">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> For there is an
annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and
uselessness  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> (for the law
made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which
we draw near to God.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Inasmuch as he was not made
priest without the taking of an oath  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> (for they indeed have been made
priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;The Lord swore and will not change his mind,
<dd>'You are a priest forever,
<dd>according to the order of Melchizedek.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> By so much, Jesus has
become the collateral of a better covenant.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Many, indeed, have been made
priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> But he, because he lives forever,
has his priesthood unchangeable.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Therefore he is also able to save
to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he
lives forever to make intercession for them.
<p> <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> For such a high priest
was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners,
and made higher than the heavens;  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> who doesn't need, like those high
priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then
for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered
up himself.  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> For the law
appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath
which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Now in the things which
we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat
down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
 <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> a servant of the
sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
 <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> For every high priest is
appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary
that this high priest also have something to offer.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> For if he were on earth, he would
not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts
according to the law;  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> who
serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned
by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, &quot;See,
you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you
on the mountain.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N24">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> But now he has obtained a more
excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better
covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> For if that first covenant had
been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> For finding fault with them, he
said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Behold, the days come,&quot; says the Lord,
<dd>&quot;that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah;
<dt> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> not according to the
covenant that I made with their fathers,
<dd>in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land
of Egypt;
<dt>for they didn't continue in my covenant,
<dd>and I disregarded them,&quot; says the Lord.
<dt> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> &quot;For this is the
covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.
<dd>After those days,&quot; says the Lord;
<dt>&quot;I will put my laws into their mind,
<dd>I will also write them on their heart.
<dt>I will be their God,
<dd>and they will be my people.
<dt> <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> They will not teach
every man his <a href="#N25">fellow citizen,</a>
<dd>and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'
<dd>for all will know me,
<dd>from the least of them to the greatest of them.
<dt> <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> For I will be
merciful to their unrighteousness.
<dd>I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> In that he says,
&quot;A new covenant,&quot; he has made the first old. But that which is
becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Now indeed even the
first<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N27">*</a></sup></font>
covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
 <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> For a tabernacle was
prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show
bread; which is called the Holy Place.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> After the second veil was the
tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> having a golden altar of incense,
and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was
a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets
of the covenant;  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> and above
it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we
can't speak now in detail.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Now these things having been thus
prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle,
accomplishing the services,  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> but into the second the high
priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for
himself, and for the errors of the people.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> The Holy Spirit is indicating
this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first
tabernacle was still standing;  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> which is a symbol of the present
age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning
the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> being only (with meats and drinks
and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of
reformation.
<p> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> But Christ having come
as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more
perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this
creation,  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> nor yet through
the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once
for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> For if the blood of goats and
bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled,
sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> how much more will the blood of
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to
God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> For this reason he is the
mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption
of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who
have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
 <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> For where a last will and
testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.
 <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> For a will is in force
where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it
lives.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> Therefore even the
first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> For when every commandment had
been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the
blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop,
and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> saying, &quot;This is the blood
of the covenant which God has commanded you.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N28">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Moreover he sprinkled
the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the
blood.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> According to the
law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of
blood there is no remission.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> It was necessary therefore that
the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but
the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> For Christ hasn't entered into
holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but
into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> nor yet that he should offer
himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year
with blood not his own,  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> or else he must have suffered
often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the
ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
 <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> Inasmuch as it is
appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> so Christ also, having been
offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without
sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> For the law, having a
shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never
with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make
perfect those who draw near.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Or else wouldn't they have ceased
to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would
have had no more consciousness of sins?  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> But in those sacrifices there is
yearly reminder of sins.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> For it is impossible that the
blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Therefore when he comes into the
world, he says,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire,
<dd>but you prepared a body for me;
<dt> <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> You had no pleasure
in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
<dd> <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Then I said, 'Behold,
I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)
<dd>to do your will, O God.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N29">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Previously saying,
&quot;Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them&quot; (those which
are offered according to the law),  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> then he has said, &quot;Behold, I
have come to do your will.&quot; He takes away the first, that he may
establish the second,  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> by
which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Every priest indeed stands day
by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never
take away sins,  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> but he,
when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right
hand of God;  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> from that
time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> For by one offering he has
perfected forever those who are being sanctified.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> The Holy Spirit also testifies
to us, for after saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> &quot;This is the
covenant that I will make with them:
<dd>'After those days,' says the Lord,
<dt>'I will put my laws on their heart,
<dd>I will also write them on their mind;'&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N30">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>then he says,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> &quot;I will
remember their sins and their iniquities no more.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N31">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Now where remission
of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Having therefore, brothers,
boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> by the way which he dedicated
for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
 <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> and having a great
priest over the house of God,  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> let's draw near with a true
heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> let us hold fast the confession
of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.
<p> <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Let us consider how
to provoke one another to love and good works,  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> not forsaking our own assembling
together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much
the more, as you see the Day approaching.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> For if we sin willfully after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a
sacrifice for sins,  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> but
a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which
will devour the adversaries.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> A man who disregards Moses' law
dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> How much worse punishment, do
you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son
of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was
sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> For we know him who said,
&quot;Vengeance belongs to me,&quot; says the Lord, &quot;I will
repay.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N32">*</a></sup></font> Again, &quot;The Lord will judge his
people.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N33">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> It is a fearful thing to fall
into the hands of the living God.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> But remember the former days, in
which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with
sufferings;  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> partly,
being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming
partakers with those who were treated so.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> For you both had compassion on
me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions,
knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring
one in the heavens.  <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> Therefore don't throw away your
boldness, which has a great reward.  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> For you need endurance so that,
having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.

saving of the soul.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Now faith is assurance
of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> For by this, the elders obtained
testimony.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> By faith, we
understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that
what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> By faith, Abel offered to God a
more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given
to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts;
and through it he, being dead, still speaks.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> By faith, Enoch was taken away,
so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God
translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his
translation he had been well pleasing to God.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Without faith it is impossible to
be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he
exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> By faith, Noah, being warned
about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the
saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir
of the righteousness which is according to faith.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> By faith, Abraham, when he was
called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an
inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> By faith, he lived as an alien in
the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with
Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> For he looked for the city which
has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> By faith, even Sarah herself
received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age,
since she counted him faithful who had promised.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Therefore as many as the stars
of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the
sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> These all died in faith, not
having received the promises, but having seen<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N35">*</a></sup></font> them and embraced them from
afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> For those who say
such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
 <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> If indeed they had been
thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had
enough time to return.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> But now they desire a better
country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to
be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
<p> <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> By faith, Abraham,
being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the
promises was offering up his one and only son;  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> even he to whom it was said,

dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the
top of his staff.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> By
faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the
children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> By faith, Moses, when he was
born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he
was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
 <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> By faith, Moses, when he
had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> choosing rather to share ill
treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
time;  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> accounting the
reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he
looked to the reward.  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> By
faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured,
as seeing him who is invisible.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> By faith, he kept the Passover,

the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven

the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having

Samuel, and the prophets;  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> who, through faith subdued

around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted,
ill-treated  <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> (of whom the
world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the
holes of the earth.  <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> These all, having had testimony
given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,  <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> God having provided some better
thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Therefore let us also,
seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every
weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with
patience the race that is set before us,  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> looking to Jesus, the author and
perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the
cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the
throne of God.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> For
consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against
himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> You have not yet resisted to
blood, striving against sin;  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> and you have forgotten the
exhortation which reasons with you as with children,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord,
<dd>nor faint when you are reproved by him;
<dt> <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> For whom the Lord
loves, he chastens,
<dd>and scourges every son whom he receives.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N43">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> It is for discipline
that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is
there whom his father doesn't discipline?  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> But if you are without
discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you
illegitimate, and not children.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Furthermore, we had the fathers
of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much
rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> For they indeed, for a few days,
punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be
partakers of his holiness.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> All chastening seems for the
present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the
peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
 <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Therefore, lift up the
hands that hang down and the feeble knees,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> and make straight paths for your
feet,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>
so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> Follow after peace with all men,
and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> looking carefully lest there be
any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness
springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> lest there be any sexually
immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for
one meal.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> For you know
that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was
rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it
diligently with tears.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> For you have not come to a
mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to
blackness, darkness, storm,  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> the sound of a trumpet, and the
voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word
should be spoken to them,  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> for they could not stand that
which was commanded, &quot;If even an animal touches the mountain, it
shall be stoned<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N46">*</a></sup></font>;&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> and so fearful was the
appearance, that Moses said, &quot;I am terrified and
trembling.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N48">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> But you have come to
Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and
to innumerable multitudes of angels,  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> to the general assembly and
assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of
all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> to Jesus, the mediator of a new
covenant,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N49">*</a></sup></font> and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks
better than that of Abel.
<p> <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> See that you don't
refuse him who speaks. For if they didn't escape when they refused him who
warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from
him who warns from heaven,  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> whose voice shook the earth
then, but now he has promised, saying, &quot;Yet once more I will shake
not only the earth, but also the heavens.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N50">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> This phrase, &quot;Yet once
more,&quot; signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of
things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may
remain.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> Therefore,
receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which
we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> for our God is a consuming
fire.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N51">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Let brotherly love
continue.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Don't forget to
show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained
angels without knowing it.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Remember those who are in bonds,
as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in
the body.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Let marriage be
held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: but God will judge
the sexually immoral and adulterers.
<p> <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Be free from the love
of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, &quot;I
will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake
you.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N52">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> So that with good courage we say,

<dt>&quot;The Lord is my helper. I will not fear.
<dd>What can man do to me?&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N53">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Remember your leaders,
men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their
conduct, imitate their faith.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, today, and forever.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Don't be carried away by various
and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by
grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not
benefited.
<p> <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> We have an altar from
which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> For the bodies of those animals,
whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an
offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N54">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Therefore Jesus also, that he
might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the
gate.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Let us therefore
go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> For we don't have here an
enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Through him, then, let us offer
up a sacrifice of praise to God<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N55">*</a></sup></font> continually, that is, the fruit of lips
which proclaim allegiance to his name.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> But don't forget to be doing
good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
<p> <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Obey your leaders and
submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will
give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for
that would be unprofitable for you.
<p> <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Pray for us, for we
are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably
in all things.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> I
strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.
<p> <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Now may the God of
peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep
with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> make you complete in every good
work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his
sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> But I exhort you,
brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few
words.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> Know that our
brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see
you.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> Greet all of your
leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> Grace be with you all. Amen.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Hebrews ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web5810h.htm or web5810h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web5811h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web5810ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>

that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are<br>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
