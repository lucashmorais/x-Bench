<h1>
Paul's First Letter to the Thessalonians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, Silvanus, and
Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> We always give thanks
to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> remembering without ceasing your
work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus
Christ, before our God and Father.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> We know, <a
href="#N1">brothers</a> loved by God, that you are chosen,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> and that our Good News came to you
not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much
assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you
for your sake.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> You became
imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much
affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> so that you became an example to
all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> For from you the word of the Lord
has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every
place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say
anything.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> For they
themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you;
and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
 <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> and to wait for his Son
from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the
wrath to come.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> For you yourselves
know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> but having suffered before and
been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God
to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> For our exhortation is not of
error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> But even as we have been approved
by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing
men, but God, who tests our hearts.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For neither were we at any time
found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness
(God is witness),  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> nor
seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might
have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> But we were gentle among you, like
a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Even so, affectionately
longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News
of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to
us.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> For you remember,
brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might
not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> You are witnesses with God, how
holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who
believe.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> As you know, we
exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his
own children,  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> to the end
that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom
and glory.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For this cause
we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the
word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but,
as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
 <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> For you, brothers, became
imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for
you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they
did from the Jews;  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> who
killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and
didn't please God, and are contrary to all men;  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> forbidding us to speak to the
Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath
has come on them to the uttermost.
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> But we, brothers,
being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried
even harder to see your face with great desire,  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> because we wanted to come to
you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again--but Satan hindered us.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> For what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font> at his
coming?  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> For you are our
glory and our joy.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Therefore, when we
couldn't stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at
Athens alone,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> and sent
Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ, to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> that no one be moved by these
afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> For most certainly, when we were
with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as
it happened, and you know.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> For this cause I also, when I
couldn't stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear
that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have
been in vain.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> But when
Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your
faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to
see us, even as we also long to see you;  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> for this cause, brothers, we were
comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> For now we live, if you
stand fast in the Lord.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> For what thanksgiving can we
render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for
your sakes before our God;  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> night and day praying exceedingly
that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your
faith?  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Now may our God
and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;
 <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> and the Lord make you to
increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even
as we also do toward you,  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> to the end he may establish your
hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of
our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Finally then, brothers,
we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how
you ought to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more.
 <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> For you know what
instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For this is the will of God: your
sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> that each one of you know how to
possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> not in the passion of lust, even
as the Gentiles who don't know God;  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> that no one should take advantage
of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an
avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
 <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> For God called us not for
uncleanness, but in sanctification.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Therefore he who rejects this
doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.
<p> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> But concerning
brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves
are taught by God to love one another,  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> for indeed you do it toward all
the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that
you abound more and more;  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> and that you make it your
ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work
with your own hands, even as we instructed you;  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> that you may walk properly toward
those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> But we don't want you
to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that
you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> For if we believe that Jesus died
and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen
asleep in Jesus.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For this
we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left
to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen
asleep.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> For the Lord
himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,
 <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> then we who are alive,
who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Therefore comfort one another
with these words.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> But concerning the
times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written
to you.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> For you yourselves
know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
 <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> For when they are saying,
&quot;Peace and safety,&quot; then sudden destruction will come on them,
like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.
 <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> But you, brothers, aren't
in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> You are all children of light, and
children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,
 <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> so then let's not sleep,
as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> For those who sleep, sleep in the
night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> But let us, since we belong to the
day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a
helmet, the hope of salvation.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> For God didn't appoint us to
wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> who died for us, that,
whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Therefore exhort one another, and
build each other up, even as you also do.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> But we beg you, brothers, to know
those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
 <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> and to respect and honor
them in love for their work's sake.
<p>Be at peace among yourselves.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> We exhort you, brothers, admonish
the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient
toward all.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> See that no
one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is
good, for one another, and for all.
<p> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Rejoice always.
 <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Pray without ceasing.
 <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> In everything give
thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Don't quench the Spirit.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Don't despise prophesies.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> Test all things, and hold firmly
that which is good.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Abstain from every form of evil.
<p> <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> May the God of peace
himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be
preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> He who calls you is
faithful, who will also do it.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Brothers, pray for us.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Greet all the brothers with a
holy kiss.  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> I solemnly
command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
<p> <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.<br>
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br>
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br>
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
