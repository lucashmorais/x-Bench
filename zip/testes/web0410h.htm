 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses in
the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the
second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of
Egypt, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;Take
a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their
families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,
every male, one by one;  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> from twenty years old and upward,
all who are able to go out to war in Israel. You and Aaron shall number
them by their divisions.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> With you there shall be a man of
every tribe; everyone head of his fathers' house.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> These are the names of the men who
shall stand with you:<br>

<p> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> These are those who
were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their
fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Moses and Aaron took these men
who are mentioned by name.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> They assembled all the
congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they
declared their ancestry by their families, by their fathers' houses,
according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
one by one.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> As Yahweh
commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.

according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
all who were able to go out to war;  <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> those who were numbered of them,

of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
<p> <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> Of the children of
Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses,
according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
all who were able to go forth to war;  <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> those who were numbered of them,
of the tribe of Dan, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
<p> <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> Of the children of
Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses,
according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
all who were able to go forth to war;  <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> those who were numbered of them,
of the tribe of Asher, were forty-one thousand five hundred.
<p> <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> Of the children of

according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
all who were able to go forth to war;  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> those who were numbered of them,
of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
<p> <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> These are those who
were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel,
being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers' house.  <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> So all those who were numbered of
the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and
upward, all who were able to go out to war in Israel;  <a name="C1V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:46</font></a> even all those who were numbered
were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.  <a name="C1V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:47</font></a> But the Levites after the tribe
of their fathers were not numbered among them.  <a name="C1V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:48</font></a> For Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C1V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:49</font></a> &quot;Only the
tribe of Levi you shall not number, neither shall you take a census of
them among the children of Israel;  <a name="C1V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:50</font></a> but appoint the Levites over the
Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all
that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle, and all its
furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.
 <a name="C1V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:51</font></a> When the tabernacle is to
move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set
up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put
to death.  <a name="C1V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:52</font></a> The children of
Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man
by his own standard, according to their divisions.  <a name="C1V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:53</font></a> But the Levites shall encamp
around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the
congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be
responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:54</font></a> Thus the children of
Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
and to Aaron, saying,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> &quot;The children of Israel shall
encamp every man by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers'
houses: at a distance from the Tent of Meeting shall they encamp around
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Those who encamp on the
east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of
Judah, according to their divisions: and the prince of the children of
Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> His division, and those who were
numbered of them, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.

to him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of
Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> His division, and those who were

and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.
 <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> His division, and those

<p> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> All who were numbered
of the camp of Judah were one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred,
according to their divisions. They shall set out first.

side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their
divisions. The prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of
Shedeur.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> His division,
and those who were numbered of it, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> &quot;Those who encamp
next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon. The prince of the children of
Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> His division, and those who were
numbered of them, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

Gad: and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of
Reuel.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> His division, and
those who were numbered of them, were forty-five thousand six hundred
fifty.
<p> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> &quot;All who were
numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred fifty-one thousand four
hundred fifty, according to their armies. They shall set out second.
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> &quot;Then the Tent of
Meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the
camps. As they encamp, so shall they set out, every man in his place, by
their standards.
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> &quot;On the west side

<p> <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> &quot;All who were
numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred eight thousand one
hundred, according to their divisions. They shall set out third.
<p> <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> &quot;On the north
side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their
divisions: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son
of Ammishaddai.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> His

<p> <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> &quot;Those who encamp

Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the
son of Enan.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> His
division, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-three thousand
four hundred.
<p> <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> &quot;All who were
numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty-seven thousand six
hundred. They shall set out last by their standards.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> These are those who
were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses. All who
were numbered of the camps according to their armies were six hundred
three thousand five hundred fifty.  <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> But the Levites were not numbered
among the children of Israel; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> Thus the children of
Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they encamped
by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families,
according to their fathers' houses.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now this is the history
of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with
Moses in Mount Sinai.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> These are the names of the sons of
Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<p> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> These are the names of
the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to
minister in the priest's office.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Nadab and Abihu died before
Yahweh, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of
Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the
priest's office in the presence of Aaron their father.
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> &quot;Bring the
tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may
minister to him.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> They
shall keep his requirements, and the requirements of the whole
congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service of the
tabernacle.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> They shall
keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and the obligations of
the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> You shall give the Levites to
Aaron and to his sons. They are wholly given to him on the behalf of the
children of Israel.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> You
shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood.
The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> &quot;Behold, I
have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all
the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Israel; and the
Levites shall be mine:  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> for all the firstborn are mine.
On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I
made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They
shall be mine. I am Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> &quot;Count the children of Levi
by their fathers' houses, by their families. You shall count every male
from a month old and upward.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Moses numbered them
according to the word of Yahweh, as he was commanded.
<p> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> These were the sons of
Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
<p> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> These are the names of
the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
<p> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> The sons of Kohath by
their families: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
<p> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> The sons of Merari by
their families: Mahli and Mushi.
<p>These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers'
houses.
<p> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Of Gershon was the
family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites: these are the
families of the Gershonites.
<p> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Those who were
numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month
old and upward, even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand
five hundred.
<p> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> The families of the
Gershonites shall encamp behind the tabernacle westward.
<p> <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> The prince of the
fathers' house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
 <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> The duty of the sons of
Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, its
covering, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting,  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> and the hangings of the court,
and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and
around the altar, and its cords for all of its service.
<p> <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> Of Kohath was the
family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family
of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the
families of the Kohathites.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> According to the number of all
the males, from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand six
hundred, keeping the requirements of the sanctuary.

their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty-two

<p> <a name="C3V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:40</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a
month old and upward, and take the number of their names.  <a name="C3V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:41</font></a> You shall take the Levites for me
(I am Yahweh) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel;
and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the

<p> <a name="C3V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:42</font></a> Moses numbered, as
Yahweh commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.

who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred

<p> <a name="C3V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:44</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C3V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:45</font></a> &quot;Take the
Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the
livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall

apiece for each one; after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them
(the shekel is twenty gerahs):  <a name="C3V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:48</font></a> and you shall give the money,
with which the remainder of them is redeemed, to Aaron and to his
sons.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:49</font></a> Moses took the
redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were
redeemed by the Levites;  <a name="C3V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:50</font></a> from the firstborn of the

<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses

to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> This is the service of the sons of
Kohath in the Tent of Meeting, the most holy things.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> When the camp moves forward, Aaron

<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> &quot;Command the
children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, and everyone
who has an issue, and whoever is unclean by the dead.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Both you shall put male and female
outside of the camp; that they not defile their camp, in the midst of
which I dwell.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> The children of Israel
did so, and put them out outside of the camp; as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so
did the children of Israel.
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> &quot;Speak to the
children of Israel: When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit,
so as to trespass against Yahweh, and that soul is guilty;  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> then he shall confess his sin
which he has done, and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full,
and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom
he has been guilty.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> But if
the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the
restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh shall be the priest's;
besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for
him.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Every heave offering
of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to
the priest, shall be his.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Every man's holy things shall be
his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> &quot;Speak to
the children of Israel, and tell them: If any man's wife goes astray, and
is unfaithful to him,  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> and
a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes of her
husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled, and there is no witness
against her, and she isn't taken in the act;  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> and the spirit of jealousy comes
on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled: or if the
spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she
isn't defiled:  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> then the
man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring her offering for
her: the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil on
it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a
meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to memory.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> The priest shall bring her near,
and set her before Yahweh;  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> and the priest shall take holy
water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the
tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> The priest shall set the woman
before Yahweh, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the
meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of
jealousy. The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that
brings a curse.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> The
priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman, 'If no man has
lain with you, and if you haven't gone aside to uncleanness, being under
your husband, be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse.
 <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> But if you have gone
astray, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has
lain with you besides your husband:'  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> then the priest shall cause the
woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall tell the
woman, 'Yahweh make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh
allows your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> and this water that brings a
curse will go into your bowels, and make your body swell, and your thigh
fall away.' The woman shall say, 'Amen, Amen.'
<p> <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> &quot;The priest shall
write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of
bitterness.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> He shall make
the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the
water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.
 <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> The priest shall take the
meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal
offering before Yahweh, and bring it to the altar.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> The priest shall take a handful
of the meal offering, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, and
afterward shall make the woman drink the water.  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> When he has made her drink the
water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled, and has committed a
trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will
enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh
will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> If the woman isn't defiled, but
is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
<p> <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> &quot;This is the law
of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes astray, and is
defiled;  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> or when the
spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he
shall set the woman before Yahweh, and the priest shall execute on her all
this law.  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> The man shall
be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> &quot;Speak to the
children of Israel, and tell them: When either man or woman shall make a
special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to Yahweh,  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> he shall separate himself from
wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of
fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh
grapes or dried.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> All the
days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine,
from the seeds even to the skins.
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> &quot;All the days of
his vow of separation there shall no razor come on his head, until the
days are fulfilled, in which he separates himself to Yahweh. He shall be
holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
<p> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> &quot;All the days that
he separates himself to Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> He shall not make himself unclean
for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister,
when they die; because his separation to God is on his head.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> All the days of his separation he
is holy to Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> &quot;If any man dies
very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then
he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he
shall shave it.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> On the
eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the
priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> The priest shall offer one for a
sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for
him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy
that same day.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> He shall
separate to Yahweh the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb
a year old for a trespass offering; but the former days shall be void,
because his separation was defiled.
<p> <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> &quot;This is the law
of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall
be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting,  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> and he shall offer his offering
to Yahweh, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering,
and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one
ram without blemish for peace offerings,  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> and a basket of unleavened bread,
cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with
oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> The priest shall present them
before Yahweh, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering.
 <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> He shall offer the ram
for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh, with the basket of
unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its meal offering, and its
drink offering.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> The
Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of
Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it
on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> The priest shall take the boiled
shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one
unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after
he has shaved the head of his separation;  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> and the priest shall wave them
for a wave offering before Yahweh. This is holy for the priest, together
with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that
the Nazirite may drink wine.
<p> <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> &quot;This is the law
of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering to Yahweh for his
separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow
which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> &quot;Speak to
Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you shall bless the children
of Israel.' You shall tell them,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> 'Yahweh bless you,
and keep you.
<dd> <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> Yahweh make his face
to shine on you,
<dd>and be gracious to you.
<dt> <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> Yahweh lift up his
face toward you,
<dd>and give you peace.'
</dl>
<p> <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> &quot;So they shall
put my name on the children of Israel; and I will bless them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> It happened on the day
that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and
sanctified it, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels,
and had anointed and sanctified them;  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> that the princes of Israel, the
heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the
tribes. These are they who were over those who were numbered:  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> and they brought their offering
before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two
of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the
tabernacle.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Yahweh spoke
to Moses, saying,  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> &quot;Accept these from them, that
they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you
shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his
service.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Moses took the wagons
and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> He gave two wagons and four oxen
to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> and he gave four wagons and eight
oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the
direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> But to the sons of Kohath he gave
none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried
it on their shoulders.
<p> <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> The princes gave
offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed,
even the princes gave their offerings before the altar.
<p> <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses,
&quot;They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the
dedication of the altar.&quot;

of the altar, after it was anointed.
<p> <a name="C7V89"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:89</font></a> When Moses went into
the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh, he heard his voice speaking to
him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from
between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> &quot;Speak to
Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give
light in front of the lampstand.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Aaron did so. He lit
its lamps to light the area in front of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded
Moses.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> This was the
workmanship of the lampstand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its
flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which Yahweh had
shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
<p> <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> &quot;Take the
Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> You shall do this to them, to
cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave
their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and
cleanse themselves.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> Then
let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with
oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> You shall present the Levites
before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of
the children of Israel.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> You shall present the Levites
before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the
Levites,  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> and Aaron shall
offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering, on the behalf of the
children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.
 <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> The Levites shall lay
their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a
sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make
atonement for the Levites.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> You shall set the Levites before
Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
 <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> Thus you shall separate
the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be
mine.
<p> <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> &quot;After that, the
Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you
shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> For they are wholly given to me
from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even
the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.
 <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> For all the firstborn
among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day
that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them
for myself.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> I have taken
the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
 <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> I have given the Levites
as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to
do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to
make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among
the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the
sanctuary.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Moses, and Aaron, and
all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites.
According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so
the children of Israel did to them.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> The Levites purified themselves
from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave
offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
 <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> After that, the Levites
went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and
before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so
they did to them.
<p> <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> &quot;This is
that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of
Meeting;  <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> and from the age
of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no
more,  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> but shall minister
with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall
do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their
duties.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after
they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> &quot;Moreover let the children of
Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> On the fourteenth day of this
month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to
all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Moses spoke to the
children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> They kept the Passover in the
first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the
wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the
children of Israel did.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> There were certain men, who were
unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the
Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that
day.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Those men said to
him, &quot;We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we
kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed
season among the children of Israel?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Moses answered them,
&quot;Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> &quot;Say to the
children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your generations is unclean
by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep
the Passover to Yahweh.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> In the second month, on the
fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with
unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> They shall leave none of it until
the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the
Passover they shall keep it.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> But the man who is clean, and is
not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut
off from his people. Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its
appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> If a foreigner lives among you,
and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of
the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall
have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the
land.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> On the day that the
tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent
of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the
appearance of fire, until morning.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> So it was continually. The cloud
covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Whenever the cloud was taken up
from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and
in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel
encamped.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> At the
commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the
commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the
tabernacle they remained encamped.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> When the cloud stayed on the
tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh's command,
and didn't travel.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Sometimes the cloud was a few
days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they
remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they
traveled.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Sometimes the
cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in
the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was
taken up, they traveled.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Whether it was two days, or a
month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it,
the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it
was taken up, they traveled.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> At the commandment of Yahweh they
encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. They kept
Yahweh's command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Make two
trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work: and you shall use
them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the
camps.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> When they shall
blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door
of the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> If they blow but one, then the
princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to
you.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> When you blow an
alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
 <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> When you blow an alarm
the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their
journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> But when the assembly is to be
gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
 <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> The sons of Aaron, the
priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute
forever throughout your generations.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> When you go to war in your land
against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm
with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before Yahweh your God, and
you shall be saved from your enemies.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> Also in the day of your
gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months,
you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the
sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a
memorial before your God: I am Yahweh your God.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> It happened in the second year,
in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was
taken up from over the tent of the testimony.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> The children of Israel set
forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and
the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> They first took their journey
according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> In the first <I>place</I> the
standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to
their armies: and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> The tent was taken down; and the
sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tent, set forward.
 <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> The standard of the camp
of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his army was
Elizur the son of Shedeur.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> The Kohathites set forward,
bearing the sanctuary: and <I>the others</I> did set up the tent against
their coming.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> The
standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to
their armies: and over his army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Over the army of the tribe of
the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> The standard of the camp of the
children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward
according to their armies: and over his army was Ahiezer the son of
Ammishaddai.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Over the
army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
 <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> Over the army of the
tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Thus were the travels of the
children of Israel according to their armies; and they set forward.
 <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Moses said to Hobab, the
son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the
place of which Yahweh said, I will give it to you: come you with us, and
we will do you good; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> He said to him, I will not go;
but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> He said, Don't leave us, please;
because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you shall be
to us instead of eyes.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> It shall be, if you go with us,
yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh shall do to us, the same will
we do to you.  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> They set
forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days' journey; and the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh went before them three days' journey, to seek out a
resting place for them.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> The cloud of Yahweh was over
them by day, when they set forward from the camp.  <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> It happened, when the ark set
forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be
scattered; and let those who hate you flee before you.  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> When it rested, he said, Return,
Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> The people were as
murmurers, <I>speaking</I> evil in the ears of Yahweh: and when Yahweh
heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Yahweh burnt among them,
and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> The people cried to Moses; and
Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> The name of that place was called
Taberah, because the fire of Yahweh burnt among them.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> The mixed multitude that was
among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again,
and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> We remember the fish, which we
ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks,
and the onions, and the garlic:  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> but now our soul is dried away;
there is nothing at all save this manna to look on.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> The manna was like coriander
seed, and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> The people went about, and
gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it
in pots, and made cakes of it: and its taste was as the taste of fresh
oil.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> When the dew fell on
the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Moses heard the people weeping
throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the
anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Moses said to Yahweh, Why have
you dealt ill with your servant? and why haven't I found favor in your
sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Have I conceived all this
people? Have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, Carry them in
your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you
swore to their fathers?  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Where should I get meat to give
to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us meat, that we may
eat.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> I am not able to
bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> If you deal thus with me, please
kill me out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not
see my wretchedness.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to
me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of
the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting,
that they may stand there with you.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> I will come down and talk with
you there: and I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it
on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you
not bear it yourself alone.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Say you to the people, Sanctify
yourselves against tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in
the ears of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was
well with us in Egypt: therefore Yahweh will give you flesh, and you shall
eat.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> You shall not eat
one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
 <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> but a whole month, until
it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you; because that you
have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
Why came we forth out of Egypt?  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Moses said, The people, among
whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will
give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Shall flocks and herds be slain
for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered
together for them, to suffice them?  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Has
Yahweh's hand grown short? now you will see whether my word shall happen
to you or not.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Moses
went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh: and he gathered seventy
men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Yahweh came down in the cloud,
and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on
the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them,
they prophesied, but they did so no more.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> But there remained two men in
the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad:
and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written,
but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> There ran a young man, and told
Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> Joshua the son of Nun, the
minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid
them.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Moses said to him,
Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh's people were
prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Moses got him into the camp, he
and the elders of Israel.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> There went forth a wind from
Yahweh, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp,
about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side,
around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.
 <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> The people rose up all
that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the
quails: he who gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them
all abroad for themselves around the camp.  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> While the flesh was yet between
their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against
the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> The name of that place was
called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
 <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> From Kibrothhattaavah
the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Miriam and Aaron spoke
against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had
married a Cushite woman.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> They said, Has Yahweh indeed
spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he spoken also with us? Yahweh heard it.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Now the man Moses was
very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.
 <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Yahweh spoke suddenly to
Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out you three to the Tent of
Meeting. They three came out.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Yahweh came down in a pillar of
cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and
they both came forth.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> He
said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Yahweh will
make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
 <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> My servant Moses is not
so; he is faithful in all my house:  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> with him will I speak mouth to
mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh
shall he see: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant,
against Moses?  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> The anger
of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> The cloud removed from over the
Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as <I>white as</I> snow: and Aaron
looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my
lord, please don't lay sin on us, for that we have done foolishly, and for
that we have sinned.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Let
her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when
he comes out of his mother's womb.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> Moses cried to Yahweh, saying,
Heal her, God, I beg you.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, If her
father had but spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? let
her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be
brought in again.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Miriam
was shut up outside of the camp seven days: and the people didn't travel
until Miriam was brought in again.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> Afterward the people traveled
from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Send you men,
that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of
Israel: of every tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, everyone a
prince among them.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Moses
sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of
Yahweh: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> These were their names: Of the
tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat
the son of Hori.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Of the
tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal
the son of Joseph.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Of the
tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti
the son of Raphu.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> Of the
tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Of the tribe of Joseph,
<I>namely</I>, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the
son of Gemalli.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Of the
tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi
the son of Vophsi.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Of
the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> These are the names of the men
who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun
Joshua.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Moses sent them
to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way by the
South, and go up into the hill country:  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> and see the land, what it is;
and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether
they are few or many;  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> and what the land is that they
dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they
dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> and what the land is, whether it
is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be of good courage,
and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
first-ripe grapes.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> So
they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob,
to the entrance of Hamath.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> They went up by the South, and
came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak,
were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
 <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> They came to the valley
of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes,
and they bore it on a staff between two; <I>they brought</I> also of the
pomegranates, and of the figs.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> That place was called the valley
of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down
from there.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> They
returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> They went and came to Moses, and
to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the
wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all
the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> They told him, and said, We came
to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey;
and this is its fruit.  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> However the people who dwell in
the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, <I>and</I> very great:
and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> Amalek dwells in the land of the
South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the
hill country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side
of the Jordan.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Caleb
stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and
possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> But the men who went up with him
said, We aren't able to go up against the people; for they are stronger
than we.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> They brought up
an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of
Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a
land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are
men of great stature.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> There we saw the Nephilim, the
sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as
grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> All the congregation
lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> All the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said
to them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had
died in this wilderness!  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Why does Yahweh bring us to this
land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey:
wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> They said one to another, Let us
make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Then Moses and Aaron fell on
their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of
Israel.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> Joshua the son of
Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the
land, tore their clothes:  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> and they spoke to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed
through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> If Yahweh delight in us, then he
will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with
milk and honey.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Only
don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they
are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is
with us: don't fear them.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> But all the congregation bade
stone them with stones. The glory of Yahweh appeared in the Tent of
Meeting to all the children of Israel.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, How long
will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for
all the signs which I have worked among them?  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> I will strike them with the
pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and
mightier than they.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Moses said to Yahweh, Then the
Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from
among them;  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> and they
will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you
Yahweh are in the midst of this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to
face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar
of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Now if you shall kill this
people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will
speak, saying,  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> Because
Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to
them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> Now please let the power of the
Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> Yahweh is slow to anger, and
abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that
will by no means clear <I>the guilty</I>, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.
 <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> Pardon, Please, the
iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving
kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even
until now.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> Yahweh said,
I have pardoned according to your word:  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> but in very deed, as I live, and
as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Yahweh;  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> because all those men who have
seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the
wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to
my voice;  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> surely they
shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any
of those who despised me see it:  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> but my servant Caleb, because he
had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring
into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> Now the Amalekite and the
Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn you, and get you into the
wilderness by the way to the <a href="#N1">Red Sea</a>.  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to
Aaron, saying,  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> How long
<I>shall I bear</I> with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I
have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur
against me.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> Tell them,
As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do
to you:  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> your dead bodies
shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according
to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured
against me,  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> surely you
shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make
you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of
Nun.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> But your little
ones, that you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall
know the land which you have rejected.  <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> But as for you, your dead bodies
shall fall in this wilderness.  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> Your children shall be wanderers
in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until
your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.  <a name="C14V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:34</font></a> After the number of the days in
which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you
will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my
alienation.  <a name="C14V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:35</font></a> I, Yahweh,
have spoken, surely this will I do to all this evil congregation, who are
gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed,
and there they shall die.  <a name="C14V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:36</font></a> The men, whom Moses sent to spy
out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur
against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,  <a name="C14V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:37</font></a> even those men who did bring up
an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.  <a name="C14V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:38</font></a> But Joshua the son of Nun, and
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy
out the land.  <a name="C14V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:39</font></a> Moses told
these words to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
 <a name="C14V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:40</font></a> They rose up early in
the morning, and got them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold,
we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised: for we
have sinned.  <a name="C14V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:41</font></a> Moses said,
Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, seeing it shall not
prosper?  <a name="C14V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:42</font></a> Don't go up,
for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck down before your
enemies.  <a name="C14V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:43</font></a> For there the
Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you shall fall by the
sword: because you are turned back from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh
will not be with you.  <a name="C14V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:44</font></a> But they presumed to go up to
the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
and Moses, didn't depart out of the camp.  <a name="C14V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:45</font></a> Then the Amalekite came down,
and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat
them down, even to Hormah.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Speak to the
children of Israel, and tell them, When you are come into the land of your
habitations, which I give to you,  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> and will make an offering by fire
to Yahweh, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a
freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to
Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock;  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> then he who offers his offering
shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part <I>of an ephah</I>
of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil:  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> and wine for the drink offering,
the fourth part of a hin, you shall prepare with the burnt offering, or
for the sacrifice, for each lamb.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Or for a ram, you shall prepare
for a meal offering two tenth parts <I>of an ephah</I> of fine flour mixed
with the third part of a hin of oil:  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> and for the drink offering you
shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to
Yahweh.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> When you prepare
a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or
for peace offerings to Yahweh;  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> then shall he offer with the bull
a meal offering of three tenth parts <I>of an ephah</I> of fine flour
mixed with half a hin of oil:  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> and you shall offer for the
drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a
pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Thus shall it be done for each
bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young
goats.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> According to the
number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to
their number.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> All who
are native-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an
offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> If a stranger lives as a
foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your
generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma
to Yahweh; as you do, so he shall do.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> For the assembly, there shall be
one statute for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner <I>with
you</I>, a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are, so
shall the foreigner be before Yahweh.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> One law and one ordinance shall
be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.
 <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> Speak to the
children of Israel, and tell them, When you come into the land where I
bring you,  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> then it shall
be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave
offering to Yahweh.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> Of
the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering: as
the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> Of the first of your dough you
shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> When you shall err, and not
observe all these commandments, which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> even all that Yahweh has
commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment, and
onward throughout your generations;  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> then it shall be, if it be done
unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the
congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a
pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with the meal offering of it, and the drink
offering of it, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin
offering.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> The priest
shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel,
and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought
their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering
before Yahweh, for their error:  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> and all the congregation of the
children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a
foreigner among them; for in respect of all the people it was done
unwittingly.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> If one
person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for
a sin offering.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> The
priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins
unwittingly, before Yahweh, to make atonement for him; and he shall be
forgiven.  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> You shall have
one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born
among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a
foreigner among them.  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> But the soul who does anything
with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same
blasphemes Yahweh; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
 <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> Because he has despised
the word of Yahweh, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall
utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> While the children of Israel
were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath
day.  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> Those who found him
gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the
congregation.  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> They put
him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to
him.  <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> Yahweh said to
Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall
stone him with stones outside of the camp.  <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> All the congregation brought him
outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Yahweh
commanded Moses.  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> Yahweh
spoke to Moses, saying,  <a name="C15V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:38</font></a> Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them that they should make them <a href="#N2">fringes</a> in the
borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put
on the <a href="#N3">fringe</a> of each border a cord of blue:  <a name="C15V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:39</font></a> and it shall be to you for a <a
href="#N4">fringe</a>, that you may look on it, and remember all the
commandments of Yahweh, and do them; and that you not follow after your
own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute;
 <a name="C15V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:40</font></a> that you may remember
and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.  <a name="C15V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:41</font></a> I am Yahweh your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Now Korah, the son of
Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the
sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <I>men</I>:
 <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> and they rose up before
Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes
of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> and they assembled themselves
together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too
much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and
Yahweh is among them: why then lift yourselves up above the assembly of
Yahweh?  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> When Moses heard
it, he fell on his face:  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> and he spoke to Korah and to all
his company, saying, In the morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who
is holy, and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he shall
choose he will cause to come near to him.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> This do: take you censers, Korah,
and all his company;  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> and
put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow: and it
shall be that the man whom Yahweh does choose, he <I>shall be</I> holy:
you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Moses said to Korah, Hear now,
you sons of Levi:  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> <I>seems it but</I> a small thing
to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of
Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tent of
Yahweh, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> and that he has brought you
near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? and seek you the
priesthood also?  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Therefore you and all your
company are gathered together against Yahweh: and Aaron, what is he who
you murmur against him?  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> Moses sent to call Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We won't come up:  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> is it a small thing that you
have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us
in the wilderness, but you must needs make yourself also a prince over us?
 <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Moreover you haven't
brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us
inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these
men? we won't come up.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> Moses was very angry, and said
to Yahweh, &quot;Don't respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey
from them, neither have I hurt one of them.&quot;  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> Moses said to Korah, You and all
your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> and take every man his censer,
and put incense on them, and bring you before Yahweh every man his censer,
two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> They took every man his censer,
and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of
the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> Korah assembled all the
congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the
glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to
Aaron, saying,  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> Separate
yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a
moment.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> They fell on
their faces, and said, God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one
man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> Speak to the
congregation, saying, Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> Moses rose up
and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
 <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> He spoke to the
congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked
men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.
 <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> So they got them up from
the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and
Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives,
and their sons, and their little ones.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> Moses said, Hereby you shall
know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for <I>I have</I> not
<I>done them</I> of my own mind.  <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> If these men die the common
death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men;
then Yahweh hasn't sent me.  <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> But if Yahweh make a new thing,
and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that
appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall
understand that these men have despised Yahweh.  <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> It happened, as he made an end
of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under
them;  <a name="C16V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:32</font></a> and the earth
opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the
men who appertained to Korah, and all their goods.  <a name="C16V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:33</font></a> So they, and all that
appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on
them, and they perished from among the assembly.  <a name="C16V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:34</font></a> All Israel that were around them
fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
 <a name="C16V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:35</font></a> Fire came forth from
Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
 <a name="C16V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:36</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C16V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:37</font></a> Speak to Eleazar
the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the
burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are holy,  <a name="C16V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:38</font></a> even the censers of these
sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a
covering of the altar: for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they
are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.  <a name="C16V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:39</font></a> Eleazar the priest took the
bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them
out for a covering of the altar,  <a name="C16V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:40</font></a> to be a memorial to the children
of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron,
comes near to burn incense before Yahweh; that he not be as Korah, and as
his company: as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.  <a name="C16V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:41</font></a> But on the next day all the
congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of Yahweh.  <a name="C16V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:42</font></a> It happened, when the
congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they
looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and
the glory of Yahweh appeared.  <a name="C16V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:43</font></a> Moses and Aaron came to the
front of the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C16V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:44</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C16V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:45</font></a> Get away from among this
congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. They fell on their
faces.  <a name="C16V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:46</font></a> Moses said to
Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay
incense thereon, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make
atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Yahweh; the plague is
begun.  <a name="C16V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:47</font></a> Aaron took as
Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the
plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made
atonement for the people.  <a name="C16V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:48</font></a> He stood between the dead and
the living; and the plague was stayed.  <a name="C16V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:49</font></a> Now those who died by the plague
were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the
matter of Korah.  <a name="C16V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:50</font></a> Aaron
returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the plague was
stayed.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> Speak to the
children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of
all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write
you every man's name on his rod.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> You shall write Aaron's name on
the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their
fathers' houses.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> You
shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I
meet with you.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> It shall
happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will
make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they
murmur against you.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> Moses
spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for
each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and
the rod of Aaron was among their rods.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Moses laid up the rods before
Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> It happened on the next day, that
Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron
for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced
blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Moses brought out all the rods
from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and
took every man his rod.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Put back
the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the
children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings
against me, that they not die.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> Moses did so. As Yahweh
commanded him, so he did.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> The children of Israel spoke to
Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
 <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Everyone who comes near,
who comes near to the tent of Yahweh, dies: shall we perish all of us?
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Aaron,
You and your sons and your fathers' house with you shall bear the iniquity
of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity
of your priesthood.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Your
brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you near
with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and
your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> They shall keep your commands,
and the duty of all the Tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels
of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor
you.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> They shall be joined
to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the
service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come near to you.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> You shall perform the duty of the
sanctuary, and the duty of the altar; that there be wrath no more on the
children of Israel.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> I,
behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of
Israel: to you they are a gift, given to Yahweh, to do the service of the
Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> You and
your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar,
and for that within the veil; and you shall serve: I give you the
priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near shall be
put to death.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> Yahweh
spoke to Aaron, I, behold, I have given you the command of my wave
offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel; to you have
I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion
forever.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> This shall be
your of the most holy things, <I>reserved</I> from the fire: every
offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin
offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they
shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> You shall eat of it like the
most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
 <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> This is yours, too: the
wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children
of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your
daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your
house shall eat of it.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> All the best of the oil, and all
the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which
they give to Yahweh, to you have I given them.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> The first-ripe fruits of all
that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, shall be yours;
everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Everything devoted in Israel
shall be yours.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Everything that opens the womb,
of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal shall be
yours: nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you
shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> You shall redeem those who are
to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for
five shekels of money, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is
twenty gerahs).  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> But you
shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or
the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on
the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a
pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Their flesh shall be yours, as
the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.
 <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> All the wave offerings
of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Yahweh, have I
given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion
forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to your
seed with you.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> Yahweh
said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall
you have any portion among them: I am your portion and your inheritance
among the children of Israel.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> To the children of Levi, behold,
I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for
their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting.
 <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Henceforth the children
of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and
die.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> But the Levites
shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their
iniquity: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations; and
among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> For the tithe of the children of
Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the
Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, Among the
children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> Moreover you shall speak
to the Levites, and tell them, When you take of the children of Israel the
tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you
shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.
 <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> Your wave offering shall
be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor,
and as the fullness of the winepress.  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> Thus you also shall offer a wave
offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you receive of the children
of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh's wave offering to Aaron the
priest.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> Out of all your
gifts you shall offer every wave offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even
the holy part of it out of it.  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> Therefore you shall tell them,
When you heave its best from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites
as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the
winepress.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> You shall eat
it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in
return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> You shall bear no sin by reason
of it, when you have heaved from it its best: and you shall not profane
the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
and to Aaron, saying,  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> This is the statute of the law
which Yahweh has commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that
they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish,
<I>and</I> on which never came yoke.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> You shall give her to Eleazar the
priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall
kill her before his face:  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> and Eleazar the priest shall take
of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of
the Tent of Meeting seven times.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> One shall burn the heifer in his
sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he
burn:  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> and the priest
shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst
of the burning of the heifer.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Then the priest shall wash his
clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall
come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
 <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> He who burns her shall
wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be
unclean until the even.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> A
man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up
outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the
congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a
sin offering.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> He who
gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean
until the even: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the
stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
 <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> He who touches the dead
body of any man shall be unclean seven days:  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> the same shall purify himself
therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but
if he doesn't purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall
not be clean.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> Whoever
touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't purify
himself, defiles the tent of Yahweh; and that soul shall be cut off from
Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall
be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> This is the law when a man dies
in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the
tent, shall be unclean seven days.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> Every open vessel, which has no
covering bound on it, is unclean.  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> Whoever in the open field
touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man,
or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> For the unclean they shall take
of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall
be put thereto in a vessel:  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> and a clean person shall take
hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all
the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the
bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> and the clean person shall
sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on
the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> But the man who shall be
unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the
midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh: the
water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> It shall be a perpetual statute
to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his
clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until
even.  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Whatever the
unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it
shall be unclean until even.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> The children of
Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in
the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there,
and was buried there.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> There was no water for the
congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and
against Aaron.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> The people
strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our
brothers died before Yahweh!  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> Why have you brought the assembly
of Yahweh into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our
animals?  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Why have you
made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? it is
no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is
there any water to drink.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> Moses and Aaron went from the
presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on
their faces: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> Take the rod, and
assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak you to
the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall
bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the
congregation and their livestock drink.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> Moses took the rod from before
Yahweh, as he commanded him.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> Moses and Aaron gathered the
assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you
rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> Moses lifted up his hand, and
struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and
the congregation drank, and their livestock.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,
Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the
children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the
land which I have given them.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> These are the waters of Meribah;
because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified
in them.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Moses sent
messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says your brother Israel,
You know all the travail that has happened to us:  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> how our fathers went down into
Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with
us, and our fathers:  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> and
when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and
brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the
uttermost of your border.  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> Please let us pass through your
land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we
drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we
will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have
passed your border.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Edom
said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword
against you.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> The
children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway; and if we
drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let
me only, without <I>doing</I> anything <I>else</I>, pass through on my
feet.  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> He said, You shall
not pass through. Edom came out against him with much people, and with a
strong hand.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> Thus Edom
refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away
from him.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> They traveled
from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came
to Mount Hor.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> Yahweh
spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom,
saying,  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> Aaron shall be
gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have
given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at
the waters of Meribah.  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son,
and bring them up to Mount Hor;  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> and strip Aaron of his garments,
and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered <I>to his
people</I>, and shall die there.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> Moses did as Yahweh commanded:
and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
 <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> Moses stripped Aaron of
his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the
top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
 <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> When all the
congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days,
even all the house of Israel.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> The Canaanite, the
king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the
way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them
captive.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Israel vowed a
vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my
hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Yahweh listened to the voice of
Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them
and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> They traveled from Mount Hor by
the way to the <a href="#N5">Red Sea</a>, to compass the land of Edom: and
the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> The people spoke against God, and
against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul
loathes this light bread.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> Yahweh sent fiery serpents among
the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
 <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> The people came to Moses,
and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh, and
against you; pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us. Moses
prayed for the people.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Make you a
fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that
everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Moses made a serpent of brass,
and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten
any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> The children of Israel traveled,
and encamped in Oboth.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> They traveled from Oboth, and
encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the
sunrise.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> From there they
traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> From there they traveled, and
encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that
comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of
Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> Therefore it is said in the book
of the Wars of Yahweh, &quot;Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,
 <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> the slope of the valleys
that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> From there they
traveled to Beer: that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather
the people together, and I will give them water.
<p> <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> Then sang Israel this
song:
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Spring up, well; sing to it:
<dd> <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> the well, which the
princes dug,
<dd>which the nobles of the people dug,
<dt>with the scepter, and with their poles.&quot;
<dt>
</dl>
<p>From the wilderness <I>they traveled</I> to Mattanah;  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel;
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> and from Bamoth to the valley
that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on
the desert.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Israel sent
messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> Let me pass through your land:
we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of
the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have
passed your border.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Sihon would not allow Israel to
pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and
went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he
fought against Israel.  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> Israel struck him with the edge
of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to
the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
 <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> Israel took all these
cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon,
and in all its towns.  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> For Heshbon was the city of
Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of
Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> Therefore those who speak in
proverbs say,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Come to Heshbon.
<dd>Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
<dt> <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> for a fire has gone
out of Heshbon,
<dd>a flame from the city of Sihon.
<dt>It has devoured Ar of Moab,
<dd>The lords of the high places of the Arnon.
<dt> <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> Woe to you, Moab!
<dd>You are undone, people of Chemosh!
<dt>He has given his sons as fugitives,
<dd>and his daughters into captivity,
<dd>to Sihon king of the Amorites.
<dt> <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> We have shot at them.
<dd>Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.
<dt>We have laid waste even to Nophah,
<dd>Which reaches to Medeba.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> Thus Israel lived in
the land of the Amorites.  <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and
they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.  <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> They turned and went up by the
way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all
his people, to battle at Edrei.  <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear
him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his
land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
who lived at Heshbon.  <a name="C21V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:35</font></a> So
they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none
left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> The children of Israel
traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
 <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> Balak the son of Zippor
saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> Moab was sore afraid of the
people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the
children of Israel.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> Moab
said to the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is
around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. Balak the son of
Zippor was king of Moab at that time.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> He sent messengers to Balaam the
son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children
of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out
from Egypt: behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they abide
over against me.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> Please
come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me:
peradventure I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may
drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed,
and he whom you curse is cursed.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> The elders of Moab and the elders
of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they
came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> He said to them, Lodge here this
night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me: and
the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> God came to Balaam, and said,
What men are these with you?  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Balaam said to God, Balak the
son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, <I>saying</I>,  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> Behold, the people that is come
out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them;
peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them
out.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> God said to Balaam,
You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people; for they are
blessed.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> Balaam rose up
in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land;
for Yahweh refuses to give me leave to go with you.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> The princes of Moab rose up, and
they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> Balak sent yet again princes,
more, and more honorable than they.  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> They came to Balaam, and said to
him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from
coming to me:  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> for I will
promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do.
Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> Balaam answered the servants of
Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't
go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> Now therefore, please wait also
here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.
 <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> God came to Balaam at
night, and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with
them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> Balaam rose up in the morning,
and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> God's anger was kindled because
he went; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an
adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two
servants were with him.  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> The donkey saw the angel of
Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the
donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam
struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> Then the angel of Yahweh stood
in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a
wall on that side.  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> The
donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself to the wall, and
crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> The angel of Yahweh went
further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn
either to the right hand or to the left.  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> The donkey saw the angel of
Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and
he struck the donkey with his staff.  <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> Yahweh opened the mouth of the
donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have
struck me these three times?  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> Balaam said to the donkey,
Because you have mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now
I had killed you.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> The
donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all
your life long to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? and he said,
No.  <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> Then Yahweh opened
the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way,
with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his
face.  <a name="C22V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:32</font></a> The angel of
Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times?
behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because your way is perverse
before me:  <a name="C22V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:33</font></a> and the
donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she
had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain you, and saved her
alive.  <a name="C22V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:34</font></a> Balaam said to
the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in
the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back
again.  <a name="C22V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:35</font></a> The angel of
Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall
speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of
Balak.  <a name="C22V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:36</font></a> When Balak heard
that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which
is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
 <a name="C22V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:37</font></a> Balak said to Balaam,
Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? why didn't you come to me? am
I not able indeed to promote you to honor?  <a name="C22V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:38</font></a> Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I
have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word
that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.  <a name="C22V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:39</font></a> Balaam went with Balak, and they
came to Kiriath Huzoth.  <a name="C22V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:40</font></a> Balak sacrificed cattle and
sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.  <a name="C22V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:41</font></a> It happened in the morning, that
Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he
saw from there the utmost part of the people.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Balaam said to Balak,
Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven
rams.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> Balak did as Balaam
had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.
 <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> Balaam said to Balak,
Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps Yahweh will come to
meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you. He went to a bare
height.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> God met Balaam:
and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered
up a bull and a ram on every altar.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Yahweh put a word in Balaam's
mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> He returned to him, and behold,
he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
 <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> He took up his parable,
and said, From Aram has Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the
mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, Come, defy Israel.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> How shall I curse, whom God has
not cursed? How shall I defy, whom Yahweh has not defied?  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> For from the top of the rocks I
see him, From the hills I see him: behold, it is a people that dwells
alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> Who can count the dust of Jacob,
Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the
righteous, Let my last end be like his!  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> Balak said to Balaam, What have
you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have
blessed them altogether.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> He answered and said, Must I not
take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> Balak said to him, Please come
with me to another place, from whence you may see them; you shall see but
the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them
from there.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> He took him
into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars,
and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> He said to Balak, Stand here by
your burnt offering, while I meet <I>Yahweh</I> yonder.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> Yahweh met Balaam, and put a
word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and say this.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> He came to him, and behold, he
was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him.
Balak said to him, What has Yahweh spoken?  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> He took up his parable, and said,
<dl>
<dt>Rise up, Balak, and hear!
<dd>Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
<dt> <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> God is not a man,
that he should lie,
<dd>nor the son of man, that he should repent.
<dt>Has he said, and will he not do it?
<dd>Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
<dt> <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> Behold, I have
received a command to bless.
<dd>He has blessed, and I can't reverse it.
<dt> <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> He has not seen
iniquity in Jacob.
<dd>Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.
<dt>Yahweh his God is with him.
<dd>The shout of a king is among them.
<dt> <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> God brings them out
of Egypt.
<dd>He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
<dt> <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> Surely there is no
enchantment with Jacob;
<dd>Neither is there any divination with Israel.
<dt>Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
<dd>What has God done!
<dt> <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> Behold, the people
rises up as a lioness,
<dd>As a lion he lifts himself up.
<dt>He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
<dd>and drinks the blood of the slain.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> Balak said to Balaam,
Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.  <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> But Balaam answered Balak,
Didn't I tell you, saying, All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?  <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> Balak said to Balaam, Come now,
I will take you to another place; peradventure it will please God that you
may curse me them from there.  <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> Balak took Balaam to the top of
Peor, that looks down on the desert.  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> Balaam said to Balak, Build me
here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams.  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> Balak did as Balaam had said,
and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> When Balaam saw that
it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to
meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he
saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came
on him.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> He took up his
parable, and said,

</dl>
<p> <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> Balak's anger was
kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said
to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have
altogether blessed them these three times.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> Therefore now flee you to your
place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has
kept you back from honor.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I
also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> If Balak would give me his house
full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do
either good or bad of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?
 <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> Now, behold, I go to my
people: come, <I>and</I> I will advertise you what this people shall do to
your people in the latter days.  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> He took up his parable, and said,

<p> <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> He looked at Amalek,

<p> <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> He looked at the

</dl>
<p> <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> Balaam rose up, and
went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Israel abode in
Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of
Moab:  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> for they called the
people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down
to their gods.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Israel
joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against
Israel.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> Yahweh said to
Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh
before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.
 <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> Moses said to the judges
of Israel, Kill you everyone his men who have joined themselves to Baal
Peor.
<p> <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> Behold, one of the
children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in
the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the
children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of
Meeting.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> When Phinehas,
the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from
the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> and he went after the man of
Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of
Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the
children of Israel.  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> Those
who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the
children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so
that I didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> Therefore say, Behold, I give to
him my covenant of peace:  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> and it shall be to him, and to
his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he
was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
 <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> Now the name of the man
of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was
Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.
 <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> The name of the
Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head
of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> Harass the Midianites,
and strike them;  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> for
they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in
the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince
of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the
matter of Peor.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> It happened after the
plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest, saying,  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> Take the
sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years
old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all who are able to go forth to
war in Israel.  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> Moses and
Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at
Jericho, saying,  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> <I>Take
the sum of the people</I>, from twenty years old and upward; as Yahweh
commanded Moses and the children of Israel, that came forth out of the
land of Egypt.  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> Reuben,
the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: <I>of</I> Hanoch, the family
of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> of Hezron, the family of the

sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and
Abiram, who were called of the congregation, who strove against Moses and
against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against Yahweh,
 <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> and the earth opened its
mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died;
what time the fire devoured two hundred fifty men, and they became a sign.
 <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Notwithstanding, the
sons of Korah didn't die.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> The sons of Simeon after their

be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers
they shall inherit.  <a name="C26V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:56</font></a> According to the lot shall their

offered strange fire before Yahweh.  <a name="C26V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:62</font></a> Those who were numbered of them
were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for
they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no
inheritance given them among the children of Israel.  <a name="C26V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:63</font></a> These are those who were
numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of
Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.  <a name="C26V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:64</font></a> But among these there was not a
man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered
the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.  <a name="C26V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:65</font></a> For Yahweh had said of them,
They shall surely die in the wilderness. There was not left a man of them,
save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> Then drew near the

wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered
themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah: but he died in
his own sin; and he had no sons.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> Why should the name of our father
be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a
possession among the brothers of our father.  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> Moses brought their cause before
Yahweh.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> The
daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you shall surely give them a
possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you shall
cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> You shall speak to the children
of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then you shall cause his
inheritance to pass to his daughter.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> If he have no daughter, then you
shall give his inheritance to his brothers.  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> If he have no brothers, then you
shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.  <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> If his father have no brothers,
then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of
his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be to the children of
Israel a statute <I>and</I> ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> Yahweh said to Moses, Go up into
this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the
children of Israel.  <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> When
you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your
brother was gathered;  <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> because you rebelled against my
word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to
sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of
Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)  <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,
 <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> Let Yahweh, the God of
the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> who may go out before them, and
who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring
them in; that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no
shepherd.  <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> Yahweh said to
Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay
your hand on him;  <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> and
set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and
commission him in their sight.  <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> You shall put of your honor on
him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.  <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> He shall stand before Eleazar
the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before
Yahweh: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in,
both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the
congregation.  <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> Moses did
as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar
the priest, and before all the congregation:  <a name="C27V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:23</font></a> and he laid his hands on him,
and commissioned him, as Yahweh spoke by Moses.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Command the
children of Israel, and tell them, My offering, my food for my offerings
made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to me, you shall observe to offer to me
in their due season.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> You
shall tell them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer
to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a
continual burnt offering.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> You shall offer the one lamb in
the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening;  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> with the tenth part of an ephah
of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of
beaten oil.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> It is a
continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant
aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Its drink offering shall be the
fourth part of a hin for the one lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering
of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> The other lamb you shall offer at
evening: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering of
it, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to
Yahweh.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> On the Sabbath
day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts <I>of
an ephah</I> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and the
drink offering of it:  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> this is the burnt offering of
every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink
offering of it.  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> In the
beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two
young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
 <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> and three tenth parts
<I>of an ephah</I> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for
each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed
with oil, for the one ram;  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> and a tenth part of fine flour
mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of
a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> Their drink offerings shall be
half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram,
and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
every month throughout the months of the year.  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> One male goat for a sin offering
to Yahweh; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and
the drink offering of it.  <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> In the first month, on the
fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh's Passover.  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> On the fifteenth day of this
month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
 <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> In the first day shall
be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work;  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> but you shall offer an offering
made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram,
and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;
 <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> and their meal offering,
fine flour mixed with oil: you shall offer three tenth parts for a bull,
and two tenth parts for the ram.  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> You shall offer a tenth part for
every lamb of the seven lambs;  <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> and one male goat for a sin
offering, to make atonement for you.  <a name="C28V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:23</font></a> You shall offer these besides
the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt
offering.  <a name="C28V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:24</font></a> After this
manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering
made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: it shall be offered besides
the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.  <a name="C28V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:25</font></a> On the seventh day you shall
have a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work.  <a name="C28V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:26</font></a> Also in the day of the first
fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your <I>feast
of</I> weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile
work;  <a name="C28V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:27</font></a> but you shall

one ram, seven male lambs a year old;  <a name="C28V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:28</font></a> and their meal offering, fine
flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for each bull, two tenth parts for
the one ram,  <a name="C28V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:29</font></a> a tenth

for you.  <a name="C28V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:31</font></a> Besides the
continual burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, you shall offer
them (they shall be to you without blemish), and their drink offerings.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> In the seventh month,
on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation; you
shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you.

 <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> On the tenth day of this
seventh month you shall have a holy convocation; and you shall afflict
your souls: you shall do no manner of work;  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> but you shall offer a burnt

in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your freewill offerings, for
your burnt offerings, and for your meal offerings, and for your drink
offerings, and for your peace offerings.  <a name="C29V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:40</font></a> Moses told the children of
Israel according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> Moses spoke to the
heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing
which Yahweh has commanded.  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> When a man vows a vow to Yahweh,
or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his
word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.  <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> Also when a woman vows a vow to
Yahweh, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her
youth,  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> and her father
hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her
father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every
bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.  <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> But if her father disallow her in
the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she
has bound her soul, shall stand: and Yahweh will forgive her, because her
father disallowed her.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> If
she be <I>married</I> to a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash
utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul,  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> and her husband hear it, and hold
his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand,
and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> But if her husband disallow her
in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on
her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her
soul: and Yahweh will forgive her.  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> But the vow of a widow, or of her
who is divorced, <I>even</I> everything with which she has bound her soul,
shall stand against her.  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> If she vowed in her husband's
house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,  <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> and her husband heard it, and
held his peace at her, and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall
stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.  <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> But if her husband made them
null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out
of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
not stand: her husband has made them void; and Yahweh will forgive her.
 <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> Every vow, and every
binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her
husband may make it void.  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> But if her husband altogether
hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows,
or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he
held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> But if he shall make them null
and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
 <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> These are the statutes,
which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father
and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> Avenge the
children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward you shall be gathered to
your people.  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> Moses spoke
to the people, saying, Arm you men from among you for the war, that they
may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.  <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> Of every tribe one thousand,
throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.  <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> So there were delivered, out of
the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed
for war.  <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> Moses sent them,
one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of
Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the
trumpets for the alarm in his hand.  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> They warred against Midian, as
Yahweh commanded Moses; and they killed every male.  <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> They killed the kings of Midian
with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba,
the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the
sword.  <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> The children of
Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all
their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for
a prey.  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> All their cities
in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt
with fire.  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> They took all
the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal.  <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> They brought the captives, and
the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the
congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab,
which are by the Jordan at Jericho.  <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> Moses, and Eleazar the priest,
and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside
of the camp.  <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> Moses was
angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the
captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Moses said to them, Have you
saved all the women alive?  <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> Behold, these caused the
children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass
against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the
congregation of Yahweh.  <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> Now therefore kill every male
among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying
with him.  <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> But all the
girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for
yourselves.  <a name="C31V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:19</font></a> Encamp you
outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever
has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the
seventh day, you and your captives.  <a name="C31V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:20</font></a> As to every garment, and all
that is made of skin, and all work of goats' <I>hair</I>, and all things
made of wood, you shall purify yourselves.  <a name="C31V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:21</font></a> Eleazar the priest said to the
men of war who went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which
Yahweh has commanded Moses:  <a name="C31V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:22</font></a> however the gold, and the
silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,  <a name="C31V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:23</font></a> everything that may abide the
fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean;
nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all
that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.
 <a name="C31V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:24</font></a> You shall wash your
clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you
shall come into the camp.  <a name="C31V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:25</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C31V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:26</font></a> Take the sum of the prey
that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest,
and the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the congregation;  <a name="C31V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:27</font></a> and divide the prey into two
parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the
congregation.  <a name="C31V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:28</font></a> Levy a
tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of
five hundred, <I>both</I> of the persons, and of the cattle, and of the
donkeys, and of the flocks:  <a name="C31V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:29</font></a> take it of their half, and give
it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh's wave offering.  <a name="C31V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:30</font></a> Of the children of Israel's
half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the
cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, <I>even</I> of all the
livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the tent
of Yahweh.  <a name="C31V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:31</font></a> Moses and
Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C31V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:32</font></a> Now the prey, over and above the
booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand
sheep,  <a name="C31V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:33</font></a> and seventy-two
thousand head of cattle,  <a name="C31V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:34</font></a> and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
 <a name="C31V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:35</font></a> and thirty-two thousand
persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.
 <a name="C31V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:36</font></a> The half, which was the
portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred
thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:  <a name="C31V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:37</font></a> and Yahweh's tribute of the
sheep was six hundred seventy-five.  <a name="C31V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:38</font></a> The cattle were thirty-six
thousand; of which Yahweh's tribute was seventy-two.  <a name="C31V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:39</font></a> The donkeys were thirty thousand
five hundred; of which Yahweh's tribute was sixty-one.  <a name="C31V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:40</font></a> The persons were sixteen
thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute was thirty-two persons.  <a name="C31V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:41</font></a> Moses gave the tribute, which
was Yahweh's wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded
Moses.  <a name="C31V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:42</font></a> Of the children
of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred  <a name="C31V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:43</font></a> (now the congregation's half was
three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,  <a name="C31V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:44</font></a> and thirty-six thousand head of
cattle,  <a name="C31V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:45</font></a> and thirty
thousand five hundred donkeys,  <a name="C31V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:46</font></a> and sixteen thousand persons),
 <a name="C31V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:47</font></a> even of the children of
Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of
animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the tent
of Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C31V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:48</font></a> The officers who were over the
thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of
hundreds, came near to Moses;  <a name="C31V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:49</font></a> and they said to Moses, Your
servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command,
and there lacks not one man of us.  <a name="C31V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:50</font></a> We have brought Yahweh's
offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and
bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for
our souls before Yahweh.  <a name="C31V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:51</font></a> Moses and Eleazar the priest
took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.  <a name="C31V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:52</font></a> All the gold of the wave
offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and
of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty
shekels.  <a name="C31V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:53</font></a> (<I>For</I> the
men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)  <a name="C31V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:54</font></a> Moses and Eleazar the priest
took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it
into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before
Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C32V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:1</font></a> Now the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock:
and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold,
the place was a place for livestock;  <a name="C32V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:2</font></a> the children of Gad and the
children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and
to the princes of the congregation, saying,  <a name="C32V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:3</font></a> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer,
and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
 <a name="C32V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:4</font></a> the land which Yahweh
struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and
your servants have livestock.  <a name="C32V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:5</font></a> They said, If we have found favor
in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession;
don't bring us over the Jordan.  <a name="C32V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:6</font></a> Moses said to the children of
Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and
shall you sit here?  <a name="C32V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:7</font></a> Why
discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into
the land which Yahweh has given them?  <a name="C32V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:8</font></a> Your fathers did so when I sent
them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.  <a name="C32V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:9</font></a> For when they went up to the
valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the
children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had
given them.  <a name="C32V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:10</font></a> Yahweh's
anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,  <a name="C32V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:11</font></a> Surely none of the men who came
up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land
which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not
wholly followed me:  <a name="C32V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:12</font></a> save
Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun;
because they have wholly followed Yahweh.  <a name="C32V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:13</font></a> Yahweh's anger was kindled
against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness
forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of
Yahweh, was consumed.  <a name="C32V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:14</font></a> Behold, you are risen up in your
fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger
of Yahweh toward Israel.  <a name="C32V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:15</font></a> For if you turn away from after
him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy
all this people.  <a name="C32V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:16</font></a> They
came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our
livestock, and cities for our little ones:  <a name="C32V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:17</font></a> but we ourselves will be ready
armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to
their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities
because of the inhabitants of the land.  <a name="C32V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:18</font></a> We will not return to our
houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his
inheritance.  <a name="C32V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:19</font></a> For we will
not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward;
because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan
eastward.  <a name="C32V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:20</font></a> Moses said to
them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before
Yahweh to the war,  <a name="C32V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:21</font></a> and
every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he
has driven out his enemies from before him,  <a name="C32V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:22</font></a> and the land is subdued before
Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh,
and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before
Yahweh.  <a name="C32V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:23</font></a> But if you will
not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin
will find you out.  <a name="C32V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:24</font></a> Build
you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that
which has proceeded out of your mouth.  <a name="C32V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:25</font></a> The children of Gad and the
children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my
lord commands.  <a name="C32V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:26</font></a> Our
little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there
in the cities of Gilead;  <a name="C32V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:27</font></a> but your servants will pass
over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord
says.  <a name="C32V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:28</font></a> So Moses commanded
concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and
to the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the tribes of the children
of Israel.  <a name="C32V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:29</font></a> Moses said to
them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you
over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the
land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of
Gilead for a possession:  <a name="C32V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:30</font></a> but if they will not pass over
with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of
Canaan.  <a name="C32V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:31</font></a> The children of
Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Yahweh has said to
your servants, so will we do.  <a name="C32V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:32</font></a> We will pass over armed before
Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance
<I>shall remain</I> with us beyond the Jordan.  <a name="C32V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:33</font></a> Moses gave to them, even to the
children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of
Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and
the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it
with <I>their</I> borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.
 <a name="C32V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:34</font></a> The children of Gad
built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,  <a name="C32V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:35</font></a> and Atrothshophan, and Jazer,
and Jogbehah,  <a name="C32V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:36</font></a> and Beth
Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.  <a name="C32V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:37</font></a> The children of Reuben built
Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,  <a name="C32V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:38</font></a> and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their
names being changed), and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities
which they built.  <a name="C32V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:39</font></a> The
children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and
dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.  <a name="C32V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:40</font></a> Moses gave Gilead to Machir the
son of Manasseh; and he lived therein.  <a name="C32V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:41</font></a> Jair the son of Manasseh went
and took its towns, and called them Havvoth Jair.  <a name="C32V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:42</font></a> Nobah went and took Kenath, and
its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> These are the journeys
of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt
by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.  <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> Moses wrote their goings out
according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh: and these are
their journeys according to their goings out.  <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> They traveled from Rameses in the
first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day
after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the
sight of all the Egyptians,  <a name="C33V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:4</font></a> while the Egyptians were burying
all their firstborn, whom Yahweh had struck among them: on their gods also
Yahweh executed judgments.  <a name="C33V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:5</font></a> The children of Israel traveled
from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.  <a name="C33V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:6</font></a> They traveled from Succoth, and
encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.  <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> They traveled from Etham, and
turned back to Pihahiroth, which is before Baal Zephon: and they encamped
before Migdol.  <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> They
traveled from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea
into the wilderness: and they went three days' journey in the wilderness
of Etham, and encamped in Marah.  <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> They traveled from Marah, and
came to Elim: and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm
trees; and they encamped there.  <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> They traveled from Elim, and
encamped by the <a href="#N6">Red Sea</a>.  <a name="C33V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:11</font></a> They traveled from the <a
href="#N7">Red Sea</a>, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.  <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> They traveled from the
wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.  <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> They traveled from Dophkah, and
encamped in Alush.  <a name="C33V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:14</font></a> They
traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where there was no water
for the people to drink.  <a name="C33V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:15</font></a> They traveled from Rephidim, and
encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.  <a name="C33V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:16</font></a> They traveled from the
wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth Hattaavah.  <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> They traveled from Kibroth
Hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.  <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> They traveled from Hazeroth, and
encamped in Rithmah.  <a name="C33V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:19</font></a> They traveled from Rithmah, and
encamped in Rimmon Perez.  <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> They traveled from Rimmon Perez,
and encamped in Libnah.  <a name="C33V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:21</font></a> They traveled from Libnah, and
encamped in Rissah.  <a name="C33V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:22</font></a> They
traveled from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.  <a name="C33V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:23</font></a> They traveled from Kehelathah,
and encamped in Mount Shepher.  <a name="C33V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:24</font></a> They traveled from Mount
Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.  <a name="C33V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:25</font></a> They traveled from Haradah, and
encamped in Makheloth.  <a name="C33V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:26</font></a> They traveled from Makheloth,
and encamped in Tahath.  <a name="C33V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:27</font></a> They traveled from Tahath, and
encamped in Terah.  <a name="C33V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:28</font></a> They

and encamped in Hor Haggidgad.  <a name="C33V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:33</font></a> They traveled from Hor
Haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.  <a name="C33V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:34</font></a> They traveled from Jotbathah,

and encamped in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh).  <a name="C33V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:37</font></a> They traveled from Kadesh, and
encamped in Mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.  <a name="C33V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:38</font></a> Aaron the priest went up into
Mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth
year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in
the fifth month, on the first day of the month.  <a name="C33V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:39</font></a> Aaron was one hundred
twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor.  <a name="C33V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:40</font></a> The Canaanite, the king of Arad,
who lived in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the
children of Israel.  <a name="C33V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:41</font></a> They
traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.  <a name="C33V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:42</font></a> They traveled from Zalmonah, and
encamped in Punon.  <a name="C33V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:43</font></a> They

Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.  <a name="C33V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:48</font></a> They traveled from the mountains
of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
 <a name="C33V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:49</font></a> They encamped by the
Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
 <a name="C33V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:50</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses in
the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,  <a name="C33V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:51</font></a> Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them, When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
 <a name="C33V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:52</font></a> then you shall drive out
all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their
figured <I>stones</I>, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish
all their high places:  <a name="C33V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:53</font></a> and you shall take possession of
the land, and dwell therein; for to you have I given the land to possess
it.  <a name="C33V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:54</font></a> You shall inherit
the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the
more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:
wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit
according to the tribes of your fathers.  <a name="C33V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:55</font></a> But if you do not drive out the
inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them
will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will
harass you in the land in which you dwell.  <a name="C33V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:56</font></a> It shall happen that as I
thought to do to them, so will I do to you.
<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,  <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> Command the
children of Israel, and tell them, When you come into the land of Canaan
(this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land
of Canaan according to its borders),  <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> then your south quarter shall be
from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south
border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;  <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> and your border shall turn about
southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings
out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth to
Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon;  <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> and the border shall turn about
from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the
sea.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> For the western
border, you shall have the great sea and the border <I>of it</I>: this
shall be your west border.  <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> This shall be your north border:
from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor;  <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> from Mount Hor you shall mark out
to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at
Zedad;  <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> and the border
shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar
Enan: this shall be your north border.  <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> You shall mark out your east
border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;  <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> and the border shall go down
from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go
down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
 <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> and the border shall go
down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea.
This shall be your land according to its borders around it.  <a name="C34V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:13</font></a> Moses commanded the children of
Israel, saying, This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which
Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
 <a name="C34V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:14</font></a> for the tribe of the
children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of
the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:  <a name="C34V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:15</font></a> the two tribes and the
half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho
eastward, toward the sunrise.  <a name="C34V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:16</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
 <a name="C34V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:17</font></a> These are the names of
the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the
priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.  <a name="C34V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:18</font></a> You shall take one prince of
every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.  <a name="C34V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:19</font></a> These are the names of the men:
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.  <a name="C34V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:20</font></a> Of the tribe of the children of
Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.  <a name="C34V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:21</font></a> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad
the son of Chislon.  <a name="C34V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:22</font></a> Of
the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.  <a name="C34V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:23</font></a> Of the children of Joseph: of
the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
 <a name="C34V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:24</font></a> Of the tribe of the
children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.  <a name="C34V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:25</font></a> Of the tribe of the children of
Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.  <a name="C34V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:26</font></a> Of the tribe of the children of
Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.  <a name="C34V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:27</font></a> Of the tribe of the children of
Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.  <a name="C34V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:28</font></a> Of the tribe of the children of
Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.  <a name="C34V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:29</font></a> These are they whom Yahweh
commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land
of Canaan.
<p> <a name="C35V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to Moses
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,  <a name="C35V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:2</font></a> Command the children of Israel
that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession
cities to dwell in; and You shall give suburbs for the cities around them
to the Levites.  <a name="C35V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:3</font></a> The
cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their
livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.  <a name="C35V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:4</font></a> The suburbs of the cities, which
you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and
outward one thousand cubits around it.  <a name="C35V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:5</font></a> You shall measure outside of the
city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two
thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the
north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be
to them the suburbs of the cities.  <a name="C35V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:6</font></a> The cities which you shall give
to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall
give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give
forty-two cities.  <a name="C35V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:7</font></a> All the
cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities
together with their suburbs.  <a name="C35V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:8</font></a> Concerning the cities which you
shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you
shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according
to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the
Levites.  <a name="C35V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:9</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying,  <a name="C35V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:10</font></a> Speak to
the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass over the Jordan into
the land of Canaan,  <a name="C35V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:11</font></a> then
you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the
manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.  <a name="C35V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:12</font></a> The cities shall be to you for
refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands
before the congregation for judgment.  <a name="C35V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:13</font></a> The cities which you shall give
shall be for you six cities of refuge.  <a name="C35V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:14</font></a> You shall give three cities
beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan;
they shall be cities of refuge.  <a name="C35V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:15</font></a> For the children of Israel, and
for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six
cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may
flee there.  <a name="C35V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:16</font></a> But if he
struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer:
the murderer shall surely be put to death.  <a name="C35V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:17</font></a> If he struck him with a stone in
the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the
murderer shall surely be put to death.  <a name="C35V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:18</font></a> Or if he struck him with a
weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a
murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  <a name="C35V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:19</font></a> The avenger of blood shall
himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to
death.  <a name="C35V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:20</font></a> If he thrust him
of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,  <a name="C35V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:21</font></a> or in enmity struck him with his
hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he
is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when
he meets him.  <a name="C35V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:22</font></a> But if he
thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without
lying in wait,  <a name="C35V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:23</font></a> or with
any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so
that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;  <a name="C35V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:24</font></a> then the congregation shall
judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these
ordinances;  <a name="C35V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:25</font></a> and the
congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of
blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where
he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high
priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.  <a name="C35V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:26</font></a> But if the manslayer shall at
any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,
 <a name="C35V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:27</font></a> and the avenger of blood
find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of
blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,  <a name="C35V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:28</font></a> because he should have remained
in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the
death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his
possession.  <a name="C35V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:29</font></a> These things
shall be for a statute <I>and</I> ordinance to you throughout your
generations in all your dwellings.  <a name="C35V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:30</font></a> Whoever kills any person, the
murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall
not testify against any person that he die.  <a name="C35V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:31</font></a> Moreover you shall take no
ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall
surely be put to death.  <a name="C35V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:32</font></a> You shall take no ransom for him
who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the
land, until the death of the priest.  <a name="C35V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:33</font></a> So you shall not pollute the
land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation
can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the
blood of him who shed it.  <a name="C35V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:34</font></a> You shall not defile the land
which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Yahweh, dwell in
the midst of the children of Israel.
<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> The heads of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came
near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of the children of Israel:  <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> and they said, Yahweh commanded
my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:
and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad
our brother to his daughters.  <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> If they be married to any of the
sons of the <I>other</I> tribes of the children of Israel, then will their
inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be
added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will
it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> When the jubilee of the children
of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their
inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
fathers.  <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> Moses commanded
the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh, saying, The tribe
of the sons of Joseph speaks right.  <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> This is the thing which Yahweh
does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be
married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of
their father shall they be married.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> So shall no inheritance of the
children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel
shall cleave everyone to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
 <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> Every daughter, who
possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be
wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of
Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.  <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> So shall no inheritance remove
from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel
shall cleave everyone to his own inheritance.  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> Even as Yahweh commanded Moses,
so did the daughters of Zelophehad:  <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah,
and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their
father's brothers' sons.  <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> They were married into the
families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance
remained in the tribe of the family of their father.  <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> These are the commandments and
the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the children of Israel
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
