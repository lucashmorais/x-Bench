<h1>
Ezra
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Now in the first year of
Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah
might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and
<I>put it</I> also in writing, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Thus says Cyrus king of Persia,
All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and
he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
 <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Whoever there is among you
of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem,
which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is
God), which is in Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Whoever is left, in any place
where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with
gold, and with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for
the house of God which is in Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Then rose up the heads of fathers'
<I>houses</I> of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites,
even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of
Yahweh which is in Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> All those who were around them
strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods,
and with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly
offered.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Also Cyrus the
king brought forth the vessels of the house of Yahweh, which
Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the
house of his gods;  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> even
those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the
treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> This is the number of them: thirty
platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,
 <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> thirty bowls of gold,
silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels one
thousand.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> All the vessels
of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did
Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from
Babylon to Jerusalem.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now these are the
children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who
had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried
away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his
city;  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> who came with
Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan,
Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of
Israel:  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> The children of

hundred twenty-three.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> The

children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim, the children of
Ami.  <a name="C2V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:58</font></a> All the Nethinim,
and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety-two.
 <a name="C2V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:59</font></a> These were those who went
up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, <I>and</I> Immer; but they
could not show their fathers' houses, and their seed, whether they were of
Israel:  <a name="C2V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:60</font></a> the children of
Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred
fifty-two.  <a name="C2V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:61</font></a> Of the
children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz,
the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai
the Gileadite, and was called after their name.  <a name="C2V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:62</font></a> These sought their register
<I>among</I> those who were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not
found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
 <a name="C2V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:63</font></a> The governor said to
them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, until there stood
up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.  <a name="C2V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:64</font></a> The whole assembly together was
forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,  <a name="C2V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:65</font></a> besides their male servants and
their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred
thirty-seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
 <a name="C2V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:66</font></a> Their horses were seven
hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;  <a name="C2V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:67</font></a> their camels, four hundred
thirty-five; <I>their</I> donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
 <a name="C2V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:68</font></a> Some of the heads of
fathers' <I>houses</I>, when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in
Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its
place:  <a name="C2V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:69</font></a> they gave after
their ability into the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of
gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priests'
garments.  <a name="C2V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:70</font></a> So the priests,
and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters,
and the Nethinim, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> When the seventh month
was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people
gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Then stood up Jeshua the son of
Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to
offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the
man of God.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> They set the
altar on its base; for fear was on them because of the peoples of the
countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh, even burnt
offerings morning and evening.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> They kept the feast of tents, as
it is written, and <I>offered</I> the daily burnt offerings by number,
according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> and afterward the continual burnt
offering, and <I>the offerings</I> of the new moons, and of all the set
feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly
offered a freewill offering to Yahweh.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> From the first day of the seventh
month began they to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh: but the foundation of
the temple of Yahweh was not yet laid.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> They gave money also to the
masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, to them of
Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea,
to Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Now in the second year of
their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the
rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who were
come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from
twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Then
stood Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the
sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house
of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the
Levites.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> When the
builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, they set the priests
in their clothing with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with
cymbals, to praise Yahweh, after the order of David king of Israel.
 <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> They sang one to another
in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, <I>saying</I>, For he is good,
for his loving kindness endures forever toward Israel. All the people
shouted with a great shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the
foundation of the house of Yahweh was laid.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> But many of the priests and
Levites and heads of fathers' <I>houses</I>, the old men who had seen the
first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes,
wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> so that the people could not
discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the
people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard
afar off.
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Now when the
adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity
were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel;  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> then they drew near to Zerubbabel,
and to the heads of fathers' <I>houses</I>, and said to them, Let us build
with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we sacrifice to him since
the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and
the rest of the heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> of Israel, said to them,
You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we
ourselves together will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus
the king of Persia has commanded us.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Then the people of the land
weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
 <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> and hired counselors
against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of
Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the
beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> In
the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of
his companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the
letter was written in the Syrian <I>character</I>, and set forth in the
Syrian <I>language</I>.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai
the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this
sort:  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> then <I>wrote</I>
Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their
companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the
Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the
Dehaites, the Elamites,  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> and the rest of the nations whom
the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria,
and in the rest <I>of the country</I> beyond the River, and so forth.
 <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> This is the copy of the
letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants the men beyond
the River, and so forth.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Be it known to the king, that the
Jews who came up from you are come to us to Jerusalem; they are building
the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired
the foundations.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Be it
known now to the king that if this city is built, and the walls finished,
they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be
hurtful to the kings.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Now
because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to
see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;
 <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> that search may be made
in the book of the records of your fathers: so you shall find in the book
of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful
to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same
of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> We inform the king that, if this
city be built, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no
portion beyond the River.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> <I>Then</I> sent the king an
answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the
rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest <I>of the
country</I> beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> The letter which you sent to us
has been plainly read before me.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> I decreed, and search has been
made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection
against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
 <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> There have been mighty
kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all <I>the country</I>
beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Make you now a decree to cause
these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree shall
be made by me.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Take heed
that you not be slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the
kings?  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> Then when the copy
of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe,
and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and
made them to cease by force and power.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> Then ceased the work of the house
of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the
reign of Darius king of Persia.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Now the prophets,
Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews
who were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel
<I>prophesied they</I> to them.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of
God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping
them.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> At the same time
came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai,
and their companions, and said thus to them, Who gave you a decree to
build this house, and to finish this wall?  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Then we told them after this
manner, what the names of the men were who were making this building.
 <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> But the eye of their God
was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, until the
matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter
concerning it.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> The copy of
the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and
Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the
River, sent to Darius the king;  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> they sent a letter to him, in
which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Be it known to the king, that we
went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is
built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work
goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Then asked we those elders, and
said to them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to
finish this wall?  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> We
asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names
of the men who were at the head of them.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Thus they returned us answer,
saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are
building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king
of Israel built and finished.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> But after that our fathers had
provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house,
and carried the people away into Babylon.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> But in the first year of Cyrus
king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.
 <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> The gold and silver
vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the
temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon,
those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were
delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
 <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> and he said to him, Take
these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let
the house of God be built in its place.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Then came the same Sheshbazzar,
and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and
since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not
completed.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Now therefore,
if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's
treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree
was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and
let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
<p>  <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Then Darius the king
made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the
treasures were laid up in Babylon.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> There was found at Achmetha, in
the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll, and therein was
thus written for a record:  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> In the first year of Cyrus the
king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at
Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices,
and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height sixty cubits, and its
breadth sixty cubits;  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> with
three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the
expenses be given out of the king's house.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Also let the gold and silver
vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the
temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and
brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everyone to its place;
and you shall put them in the house of God.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Now therefore, Tattenai, governor
beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites,
who are beyond the River, be you far from there:  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> let the work of this house of God
alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this
house of God in its place.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Moreover I make a decree what you
shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of
God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River,
expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they be not
hindered.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> That which they
have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings
to the God of heaven; <I>also</I> wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to
the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by
day without fail;  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> that
they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray
for the life of the king, and of his sons.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Also I have made a decree, that
whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house,
and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a
dunghill for this:  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> and
the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and
peoples who shall put forth their hand to alter <I>the same</I>, to
destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a
decree; let it be done with all diligence.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Then Tattenai, the governor
beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions, because that
Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> The elders of the Jews built and
prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the
son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of
the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and
Artaxerxes king of Persia.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> This house was finished on the
third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of
Darius the king.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> The
children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the
children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with
joy.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> They offered at the
dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four
hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats,
according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> They set the priests in their
divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which
is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> The children of the captivity
kept the Passover on the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the first month.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> For the priests and the Levites
had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed
the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers
the priests, and for themselves.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> The children of Israel who had
come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves
to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Yahweh,
the God of Israel, ate,  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> and kept the feast of unleavened
bread seven days with joy: for Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned
the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the
work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Now after these
things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of
Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> the son of Shallum, the son of
Zadok, the son of Ahitub,  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> the son of Amariah, the son of
Azariah, the son of Meraioth,  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> the son of Zerahiah, the son of
Uzzi, the son of Bukki,  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> the son of Abishua, the son of
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> this Ezra went up from Babylon:
and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of
Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to
the hand of Yahweh his God on him.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> There went up some of the children
of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the
porters, and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes
the king.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> He came to
Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
 <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> For on the first
<I>day</I> of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the
first <I>day</I> of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the
good hand of his God on him.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> For Ezra had set his heart to
seek the law of Yahweh, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and
ordinances.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Now this is
the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest,
the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh,
and of his statutes to Israel:  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Artaxerxes, king of kings, to
Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and
so forth.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> I make a
decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the
Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own free will to go to
Jerusalem, go with you.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> Because you are sent of the king
and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
according to the law of your God which is in your hand,  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> and to carry the silver and gold,
which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of
Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> and all the silver and gold that
you shall find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering
of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of
their God which is in Jerusalem;  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> therefore you shall with all
diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal
offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of
the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> Whatever shall seem good to you
and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that
do you after the will of your God.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> The vessels that are given you
for the service of the house of your God, deliver you before the God of
Jerusalem.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Whatever more
shall be needful for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion
to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do
make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that
whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven,
shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> to one hundred talents of silver,
and to one hundred measures of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine,
and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
 <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Whatever is commanded by
the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of
heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and
his sons?  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Also we inform
you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters,
Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to
impose tribute, custom, or toll, on them.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> You, Ezra, after the wisdom of
your God who is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may
judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws
of your God; and teach you him who doesn't know them.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> Whoever will not do the law of
your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with
all diligence, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to
confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our
fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify
the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem;  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> and has extended loving kindness
to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's
mighty princes. I was strengthened according to the hand of Yahweh my God
on me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Now these are the
heads of their fathers' <I>houses</I>, and this is the genealogy of those
who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
 <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Of the sons of Phinehas,
Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush.
 <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Of the sons of Shecaniah,
of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy
of the males one hundred fifty.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Of the sons of Pahathmoab,
Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son
of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son
of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the
son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> Of the sons of Shephatiah,
Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him eighty males.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the
son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Of the sons of Shelomith, the son
of Josiphiah; and with him one hundred sixty males.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah
the son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the
son of Hakkatan; and with him one hundred ten males.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Of the sons of Adonikam, <I>who
were</I> the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and
Shemaiah; and with them sixty males.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and
Zabbud; and with them seventy males.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> I gathered them together to the
river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed
the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
 <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Then sent I for Eliezer,
for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for
Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men;
also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> I sent them forth to Iddo the
chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo,
<I>and</I> his brothers the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they
should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> According to the good hand of our
God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the
son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his
brothers, eighteen;  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> and
Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and
their sons, twenty;  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> and
of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of
the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned
by name.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Then I
proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble
ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for
our little ones, and for all our substance.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> For I was ashamed to ask of the
king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the
way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on
all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against
all those who forsake him.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> So we fasted and begged our God
for this: and he was entreated of us.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Then I set apart twelve of the
chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their
brothers with them,  <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> and
weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the
offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and
his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> I weighed into their hand six
hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels one hundred talents;
of gold one hundred talents;  <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> and twenty bowls of gold, of one
thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.
 <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> I said to them, You are
holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are
a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> Watch you, and keep them, until
you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the
princes of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the
chambers of the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> So the priests and the Levites
received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring
them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> Then we departed from the river
Ahava on the twelfth <I>day</I> of the first month, to go to Jerusalem:
and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of
the enemy and the bandit by the way.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> We came to Jerusalem, and abode
there three days.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> On the
fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the
house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest;
and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad
the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> the whole by number and by
weight: and all the weight was written at that time.  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> The children of the captivity,
who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel,
twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and
twelve male goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to
Yahweh.  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> They delivered
the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond
the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Now when these things
were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and
the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the
peoples of the lands, <I>doing</I> according to their abominations, even
of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> For they have taken of their
daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have
mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands: yes, the hand of the
princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> When I heard this thing, I tore my
garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard,
and sat down confounded.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Then were assembled to me everyone
who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of
them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering.
 <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> At the evening offering I
arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I
fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> and I said, my God, I am ashamed
and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities are
increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up to the heavens.
 <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Since the days of our
fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our iniquities
have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the
kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to
confusion of face, as it is this day.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Now for a little moment grace has
been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to
give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and
give us a little reviving in our bondage.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> For we are bondservants; yet our
God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness
to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set
up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in
Judah and in Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> Now, our God, what shall we say
after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> which you have commanded by your
servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is
an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands,
through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another
with their filthiness:  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> now therefore don't give your
daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor
seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and
eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
forever.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> After all that
is come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you
our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given
us such a remnant,  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> shall
we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples
that do these abominations? would not you be angry with us until you had
consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Yahweh, the God of
Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as
it is this day: behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for none can
stand before you because of this.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now while Ezra prayed
and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of
God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great
assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
 <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Shecaniah the son of
Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, We have trespassed against
our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet
now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Now therefore let us make a
covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of
them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the
commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Arise; for the matter belongs to
you, and we are with you: be of good courage, and do it.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Then arose Ezra, and made the
chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they
would do according to this word. So they swore.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Then Ezra rose up from before the
house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib:
and <I>when</I> he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he
mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> They made proclamation throughout
Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should
gather themselves together to Jerusalem;  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> and that whoever didn't come
within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders,
all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
assembly of the captivity.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Then all the men of Judah and
Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days;
it was the ninth month, on the twentieth <I>day</I> of the month: and all
the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling
because of this matter, and for the great rain.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> Ezra the priest stood up, and
said to them, You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to
increase the guilt of Israel.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Now therefore make confession to
Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate
yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
 <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Then all the assembly
answered with a loud voice, As you have said concerning us, so must we do.
 <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> But the people are many,
and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside:
neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed
in this matter.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Let now
our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are
in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and
with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath
of our God be turned from us, until this matter be dispatched.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Only Jonathan the son of Asahel
and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this <I>matter</I>: and
Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> The children of the captivity
did so. Ezra the priest, <I>with</I> certain heads of fathers'
<I>houses</I>, after their fathers' houses, and all of them by their
names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth
month to examine the matter.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> They made an end with all the
men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
 <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Among the sons of the
priests there were found who had married foreign women: <I>namely</I>, of
the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and
Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> They gave their hand that they
would put away their wives; and being guilty, <I>they offered</I> a ram of
the flock for their guilt.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and
Zebadiah.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> Of the sons of

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
