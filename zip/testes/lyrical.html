<pre>
    WHAT! no way left to shun th' inglorious stage,
    And save from infamy my sinking age!
    Scarce half alive, oppress'd with many a year,
    What in the name of dotage drives me here?
    A time there was, when glory was my guide,             5
    Nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside;
    Unaw'd by pow'r, and unappall'd by fear,
    With honest thrift I held my honour dear;
    But this vile hour disperses all my store,
    And all my hoard of honour is no more.                10
    For ah! too partial to my life's decline,
    Caesar persuades, submission must be mine;
    Him I obey, whom heaven itself obeys,
    Hopeless of pleasing, yet inclin'd to please.
    Here then at once, I welcome every shame,             15
    And cancel at threescore a life of fame;
    No more my titles shall my children tell,
    The old buffoon will fit my name as well;
    This day beyond its term my fate extends,
    For life is ended when our honour ends.               20

<center><b>THE GIFT</b><br>
<br>
 <small>TO IRIS, IN BOW STREET, CONVENT GARDEN</small><br>
<br>
</center>

<pre>
        SAY, cruel IRIS, pretty rake,
          Dear mercenary beauty,
        What annual offering shall I make,
          Expressive of my duty?
        
        My heart, a victim to thine eyes,               5
          Should I at once deliver,
        Say, would the angry fair one prize
          The gift, who slights the giver?
        
        A bill, a jewel, watch, or toy,
          My rivals give&mdash;and let 'em;                  10
        If gems, or gold, impart a joy,
          I'll give them&mdash;when I get 'em.
        
        I'll give&mdash;but not the full-blown rose,
          Or rose-bud more in fashion;
        Such short-liv'd offerings but disclose        15
          A transitory passion.
        
        I'll give thee something yet unpaid,
          Not less sincere, than civil:
        I'll give thee&mdash;Ah! too charming maid,
          <u>I'll give thee</u>&mdash;To the devil.                 30

<center><b>THE LOGICIANS REFUTED</b><br>
<br>
 <small>IN IMITATION OF DEAN SWIFT</small><br>
<br>
</center>

<pre>
    LOGICIANS have but ill defin'd
    As rational, the human kind;
    Reason, they say, belongs to man,
    But let them prove it if they can.
    <u>Wise Aristotle and Smiglecius,</u>                         5
    By ratiocinations specious,
    Have strove to prove with great precision,
    With definition and division,
    <i>Homo est ratione praeditum,</i>&mdash;
    But for my soul I cannot credit 'em;                  10
    And must in spite of them maintain,
    That man and all his ways are vain;
    And that this boasted lord of nature
    Is both a weak and erring creature;
    That instinct is a surer guide                        15
    <u>Than reason-boasting mortals' pride;</u>
    And that brute beasts are far before 'em,
    <u><i>Deus est anima brutorum</i>.</u>
    Who ever knew an honest brute
    At law his neighbour prosecute,                       20
    Bring action for assault and battery,
    Or friend beguile with lies and flattery?
    O'er plains they ramble unconfin'd,
    No politics disturb their mind;
    They eat their meals, and take their sport,           25
    Nor know who's in or out at court;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
    They never to the levee go
    To treat as dearest friend, a foe;
    They never importune his grace,
    Nor ever cringe to men in place;                      30
    Nor undertake a dirty job,
    Nor draw the quill to write for <u>B&mdash;&mdash;b.</u>
    Fraught with invective they ne'er go
    To folks at Pater-Noster-Row;
    No judges, fiddlers, dancing-masters,                 35
    No pick-pockets, or poetasters,
    Are known to honest quadrupeds;
    No single brute his fellow leads.
    Brutes never meet in bloody fray,
    Nor cut each others' throats, for pay.                40
    Of beasts, it is confess'd, the ape
    Comes nearest us in human shape;
    Like man he imitates each fashion,
    And malice is his ruling passion;
    But both in malice and grimaces                       45
    <u>A courtier any ape surpasses.</u>
    Behold him humbly cringing wait
    Upon a minister of state;
    View him soon after to inferiors,
    Aping the conduct of superiors;                       50
    He promises with equal air,
    And to perform takes equal care.
    He in his turn finds imitators;
    At court, the porters, lacqueys, waiters,
    Their master's manners still contract,                55
    <u>And footmen, lords and dukes can act.</u>
    Thus at the court both great an small
    Behave alike&mdash;for all ape all.

<pre>
    AMIDST the clamour of exulting joys,
      Which triumph forces from the patriot heart,
    Grief dares to mingle her soul-piercing voice,

      And saw thee fall with joy-pronouncing eyes:        10
    Yet they shall know thou conquerest, though dead&mdash;

</center>

<pre>
        GOOD people all, with one accord,
          Lament for Madam BLAIZE,
        Who never wanted a good word&mdash;
          <i>From those who spoke her praise.</i>
        
        The needy seldom pass'd her door,              5
          And always found her kind;
        She freely lent to all the poor,&mdash;
          <u><i>Who left a pledge behind.</i></u>
        
        She strove the neighbourhood to please,
          With manners wond'rous winning,             10
        And never follow'd wicked ways,&mdash;
          <i>Unless when she was sinning.</i>
        
        At church, in silks and satins new,
          With hoop of monstrous size,
        She never slumber'd in her pew,&mdash;              15
          <i>But when she shut her eyes.</i>
        
        Her love was sought, I do aver,
          By twenty beaux and more;
        The king himself has follow'd her,&mdash;
          <u><i>When she has walk'd before.</i></u>                 20
        
        But now her wealth and finery fled,
          Her hangers-on cut short all;
        The doctors found, when she was dead,&mdash;
          <u><i>Her last disorder mortal.</i></u>
        
        Let us lament, in sorrow sore,                25
          For <u>Kent-street</u> well may say,
        That had she liv'd a twelve-month more,&mdash;

<pre>
    WHERE the Red Lion flaring o'er the way,
    Invites each passing stranger that can pay;
    <u>Where Calvert's butt, and Parsons' black champagne,</u>
    Regale the drabs and bloods of Drury-lane;
    There in a lonely room, from bailiffs snug,             5
    The Muse found Scroggen stretch'd beneath a rug;
    A window, patch'd with paper, lent a ray,
    That dimly show'd the state in which he lay;
    The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread;
    <u>The humid wall with paltry pictures spread:</u>            10
    <u>The royal game of goose was there in view,</u>
    <u>And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew;</u>
    <u>The seasons, fram'd with listing, found a place,</u>
    <u>And brave prince William</u> show'd his lamp-black face:
    The morn was cold, he views with keen desire           15
    The rusty grate unconscious of a fire;
    <u>With beer and milk arrears</u> the frieze was scor'd,
    And five crack'd teacups dress'd the chimney board;
    A nightcap deck'd his brows instead of bay,
    <u>A cap by night&mdash;a stocking all the day!</u>                 20

    The heartfelt power of every charm divine,

    See how she moves along with every grace,              5
    While soul-brought tears steal down each shining face.
    She speaks! 'tis rapture all, and nameless bliss,
    Ye gods! what transport e'er compared to this.
    As when in Paphian groves the Queen of Love
    With fond complaint addressed the listening Jove,     10
    'Twas joy, and endless blisses all around,
    And rocks forgot their hardness at the sound.
    Then first, at last even Jove was taken in,
    And felt her charms, without disguise, within.

<center><b>THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
 <small>A TALE</small><br>
</center>

<pre>
    SECLUDED from domestic strife,
    <u>Jack Book-worm led a college life;</u>
    A fellowship at twenty-five
    Made him the happiest man alive;
    He drank his glass and crack'd his joke,           5
    <u>And freshmen wonder'd as he spoke.</u>
    
      Such pleasures, unalloy'd with care,
    Could any accident impair?
    Could Cupid's shaft at length transfix
    Our swain, arriv'd at thirty-six?                 10
    O had the archer ne'er come down
    To ravage in a country town!
    Or Flavia been content to stop
    At triumphs in a Fleet-street shop.
    O had her eyes forgot to blaze!                   15
    Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze.
    O!&mdash;&mdash;But let exclamation cease,
    <u>Her presence banish'd all his peace.</u>
    So with decorum all things carried;
    Miss frown'd, and blush'd, and then was&mdash;married.  20
    
      Need we expose to vulgar sight
    The raptures of the bridal night?
    Need we intrude on hallow'd ground,
    Or draw the curtains clos'd around?
    Let it suffice, that each had charms;             25
    He clasp'd a goddess in his arms;

    And though she felt his <u>usage</u> rough,
    Yet in a man 'twas well enough.
    
      The honey-moon like lightning flew,
    The second brought its transports too.            30
    A third, a fourth, were not amiss,
    The fifth was friendship mix'd with bliss:
    But when a twelvemonth pass'd away,
    Jack found his goddess made of clay;
    Found half the charms that deck'd her face        35
    Arose from powder, shreds, or lace;
    But still the worst remain'd behind,
    That very face had robb'd her mind.
    
      <u>Skill'd in no other arts was she</u>
    But dressing, patching, repartee;                 40
    And, just as humour rose or fell,
    By turns a slattern or a belle;
    'Tis true she dress'd with modern grace,
    Half naked at a ball or race;
    But when at home, at board or bed,                45
    <u>Five greasy nightcaps wrapp'd her head.</u>
    Could so much beauty condescend
    To be a dull domestic friend?
    Could any curtain-lectures bring
    To decency so fine a thing?                       50
    In short, by night, 'twas fits or fretting;
    <u>By day, 'twas gadding or coquetting.</u>
    Fond to be seen, she kept a bevy

    Jack suck'd his pipe, and often broke
    <u>A sigh in suffocating smoke;</u>
    While all their hours were pass'd between
    Insulting repartee or spleen.                     60
    
      <u>Thus as her faults each day were known,</u>
    He thinks her features coarser grown;
    He fancies every vice she shows,
    Or thins her lip, or points her nose:
    Whenever rage or envy rise,                       65
    How wide her mouth, how wild her eyes!
    He knows not how, but so it is,
    Her face is grown a knowing phiz;
    And, though her fops are wond'rous civil,
    He thinks her ugly as the devil.                  70
    
      <u>Now, to perplex</u> the ravell'd noose,
    As each a different way pursues,
    While sullen or loquacious strife,
    Promis'd to hold them on for life,
    That dire disease, whose ruthless power           75
    Withers the beauty's transient flower:
    Lo!  the small-pox, whose horrid glare
    Levell'd its terrors at the fair;
    And, rifling ev'ry youthful grace,
    Left but the remnant of a face.                   80
    
      The glass, grown hateful to her sight,
    Reflected now a perfect fright:
    Each former art she vainly tries
    To bring back lustre to her eyes.
    In vain she tries her <u>paste</u> and creams,           85
    To smooth her skin, or hide its seams;

    Her country beaux and city cousins,
    Lovers no more, flew off by dozens:
    The 'squire himself was seen to yield,
    And e'en the captain quit the field.              90
    
      Poor Madam, now <u>condemn'd to hack</u>
    The rest of life with anxious Jack,
    Perceiving others fairly flown,
    Attempted pleasing him alone.
    Jack soon was dazzl'd to behold                   95
    Her present face surpass the old;
    With modesty her cheeks are dy'd,
    Humility displaces pride;
    For tawdry finery is seen
    A person ever neatly clean:                      100
    No more presuming on her sway,
    She learns good-nature every day;
    Serenely gay, and strict in duty,
    Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty.

<center><b>A NEW SIMILE</b><br>
<br>
 <small>IN THE MANNER OF SWIFT</small><br>
<br>
</center>

<pre>
    <u>LONG had I sought in vain to find</u>
    A likeness for the scribbling kind;
    The modern scribbling kind, who write
    In wit, and sense, and nature's spite:
    Till reading, I forget what day on,                5
    A chapter out of <u>Tooke's Pantheon,</u>
    I think I met with something there,
    To suit my purpose to a hair;
    But let us not proceed too furious,
    First please to turn to god Mercurius;            10
    You'll find him pictur'd at full length
    In book the second, page the tenth:
    The stress of all my proofs on him I lay,
    And now proceed we to our simile.
    
      Imprimis, pray observe his hat,                 15
    <u>Wings upon either side&mdash;mark that.</u>
    Well! what is it from thence we gather?
    Why these denote a brain of feather.
    A brain of feather! very right,
    With wit that's flighty, learning light;          20
    Such as to modern bard's decreed:
    A just comparison,&mdash;proceed.
    
      In the next place, his feet peruse,
    Wings grow again from both his shoes;
    Design'd, no doubt, their part to bear,           25
    And waft his godship through the air;

    And here my simile unites,
    For in a modern poet's flights,
    I'm sure it may be justly said,
    His feet are useful as his head.                  30
    
      Lastly, vouchsafe t'observe his hand,
    Filled with a snake-encircl'd wand;
    By classic authors term'd caduceus,
    And highly fam'd for several uses.
    To wit&mdash;most wond'rously endu'd,                   35
    <u>No poppy water half so good;</u>
    For let folks only get a touch,
    Its soporific virtue's such,
    Though ne'er so much awake before,
    That quickly they begin to snore.                 40
    Add too, what certain writers tell,
    <u>With this he drives men's souls to hell.</u>
    
      Now to apply, begin we then;
    His wand's a modern author's pen;
    The serpents round about it twin'd                45
    Denote him of the reptile kind;
    Denote the rage with which he writes,
    His frothy slaver, venom'd bites;
    An equal semblance still to keep,
    Alike too both conduce to sleep.                  50
    This diff'rence only, as the god
    Drove souls to Tart'rus with his rod,
    With his goosequill the scribbling elf,
    Instead of others, damns himself.
    
      And here my simile almost tript,                55
    Yet grant a word by way of postscript.

    Well! what of that? out with it&mdash;stealing;
    <u>In which all modern bards agree,</u>
    Being each as great a thief as he:                60
    But ev'n this deity's existence
    Shall lend my simile assistance.
    Our modern bards! why what a pox
    Are they but senseless stones and blocks?

        Good people all, of every sort,
          Give ear unto my song;
        And if you find it wond'rous short,
          It cannot hold you long.
        
        <u>In Islington there was a man,</u>                  5
          Of whom the world might say,
        That still a godly race he ran,
          Whene'er he went to pray.
        
        A kind and gentle heart he had,
          To comfort friends and foes;                10
        The naked every day he clad,
          When he put on his clothes.
        
        And in that town a dog was found,
          As many dogs there be,
        Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,        15
          And curs of low degree.
        
        This dog and man at first were friends;
          But when a pique began,
        <u>The dog, to gain some private ends,</u>
          Went mad and bit the man.                   20
        
        Around from all the neighbouring streets
          The wond'ring neighbours ran,
        And swore the dog had lost his wits,
          To bite so good a man.

        WHEN lovely woman stoops to folly,

</center>

<pre>
    <u>As puffing quacks</u> some caitiff wretch procure
    To swear the pill, or drop, has wrought a cure;
    Thus on the stage, our play-wrights still depend
    For Epilogues and Prologues on some friend,
    Who knows each art of coaxing up the town,             5
    And make full many a bitter pill go down.
    Conscious of this, our bard has gone about,
    And teas'd each rhyming friend to help him out.
    'An Epilogue&mdash;things can't go on without it;
    It could not fail, would you but set about it.'       10
    'Young man,' cries one&mdash;a bard laid up in clover&mdash;
    'Alas, young man, my writing days are over;
    Let boys play tricks, and kick the straw; not I:
    Your brother Doctor there, perhaps, may try.'
    'What I? dear Sir,' the Doctor interposes             15
    'What plant my thistle, Sir, among his roses!
    <u>No, no; I've other contests to maintain;</u>
    To-night I head our troops at Warwick Lane:
    <u>Go, ask your manager.'</u> 'Who, me? Your pardon;
    Those things are not our forte at Covent Garden.'     20
    Our Author's friends, thus plac'd at happy distance,
    Give him good words indeed, but no assistance.
    As some unhappy wight, at some new play,
    At the Pit door stands elbowing a way,
    While oft, with many a smile, and many a shrug,       25
    He eyes the centre, where his friends sit snug;

    Sink as he sinks, and as he rises rise;
    He nods, they nod; he cringes, they grimace;
    But not a soul will budge to give him place.          30
    Since then, unhelp'd, our bard must now conform
    <u>'To 'bide the pelting of this pitiless storm'&mdash;</u>
    Blame where you must, be candid where you can;
    <u>And be each critic the <i>Good Natur'd Man.</i></u>

    WHAT! five long acts&mdash;and all to make us wiser!
    Our authoress sure has wanted an adviser.
    Had she consulted <i>me</i>, she should have made
    Her moral play a speaking masquerade;
    Warm'd up each bustling scene, and in her rage            5
    Have emptied all the green-room on the stage.
    My life on't, this had kept her play from sinking;
    Have pleas'd our eyes, and sav'd the pain of thinking.
    Well! since she thus has shown her want of skill,
    What if I give a masquerade?&mdash;I will.                     10
    But how? ay, there's the rub! (<i>pausing</i>)&mdash;I've got my cue:
    The world's a masquerade! the maskers, you, you, you.
                                (<i>To Boxes, Pit, and Gallery.</i>)
    &mdash;&mdash;, what a group the motley scene discloses!
    False wits, false wives, false virgins, and false spouses!
    Statesmen with bridles on; and, close beside 'em,        15
    Patriots, in party-coloured suits, that ride 'em.
    There Hebes, turn'd of fifty, try once more
    To raise a flame in Cupids of threescore.
    These in their turn, with appetites as keen,
    Deserting fifty, fasten on fifteen,                      20
    Miss, not yet full fifteen, with fire uncommon,
    Flings down her sampler, and takes up the woman:
    The little urchin smiles, and spreads her lure,
    And tries to kill, ere she's got power to cure.
    Thus 'tis with all&mdash;their chief and constant care         25
    Is to seem everything but what they are.

    You'll find his lionship a very lamb.

    He bows, turns round, and whip&mdash;the man's a black!        40
    Yon critic, too&mdash;but whither do I run?
    If I proceed, our bard will be undone!
    Well then a truce, since she requests it too:
    Do you spare her, and I'll for once spare you.

    First of the train the patient rustic came,
      Whose callous hand had form'd the scene,
    Bending at once with sorrow and with age,              30
      With many a tear and many a sigh between;
    'And where,' he cried, 'shall now my babes have bread,
      Or how shall age support its feeble fire?
    No lord will take me now, my vigour fled,
      Nor can my strength perform what they require;       35
    Each grudging master keeps the labourer bare&mdash;
    A sleek and idle race is all their care.
    My noble mistress thought not so:
      Her bounty, like the morning dew,
    Unseen, though constant, used to flow;                 40

    By use and daily meditation worn;                      45

<pre>
    LET school-masters puzzle their brain,
      With grammar, and nonsense, and learning;
    Good liquor, I stoutly maintain,
      Gives 'genus' a better discerning.
    Let them brag of their heathenish gods,                5
      Their Lethes, their Styxes, and Stygians:
    Their Quis, and their Quaes, and their Quods,
      They're all but a parcel of Pigeons.

      A-preaching that drinking is sinful,                10

      They always preach best with a skinful.
    But when you come down with your pence,
      For a slice of their scurvy religion,
    I'll leave it to all men of sense,                    15

    Then come, put the jorum about,
      And let us be merry and clever;
    Our hearts and our liquors are stout;
      Here's the Three Jolly Pigeons for ever.            20
    Let some cry up woodcock or hare,
      Your bustards, your ducks, and your widgeons;
    <u>But of all the birds in the air,</u>
      Here's a health to the Three Jolly Pigeons.

<center><b>EPILOGUE TO 'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER'</b><br>
</center>

<pre>
    WELL, having stoop'd to conquer with success,
    And gain'd a husband without aid from dress,
    Still, as a Bar-maid, I could wish it too,
    As I have conquer'd him, to conquer you:
    And let me say, for all your resolution,               5
    <u>That pretty Bar-maids have done execution.</u>
    Our life is all a play, compos'd to please,
    'We have our exits and our entrances.'
    The First Act shows the simple country maid,
    Harmless and young, of ev'ry thing afraid;            10
    Blushes when hir'd, and, with unmeaning action,
    'I hopes as how to give you satisfaction.'
    Her Second Act displays a livelier scene&mdash;
    Th' unblushing Bar-maid of a country inn,
    Who whisks about the house, at market caters,         15
    Talks loud, <u>coquets the guests,</u> and scolds the waiters.
    Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,
    The chop-house toast of ogling connoisseurs.
    On 'Squires and Cits she there displays her arts,
    And on the gridiron broils her lovers' hearts:        20
    And as she smiles, her triumphs to complete,
    Even Common-Councilmen forget to eat.
    The Fourth Act shows her wedded to the 'Squire,
    And Madam now begins to hold it higher;
    Pretends to taste, at Operas cries <i>caro</i>,              25
    And quits her <u><i>Nancy Dawson</i>,</u> for <u><i>Che faro</i>,</u>
    Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,
    Swims round the room, <u>the Heinel of Cheapside;</u>

    Such, through our lives, the eventful history&mdash;
    The Fifth and Last Act still remains for me.
    The Bar-maid now for your protection prays.
    Turns Female Barrister, and pleads for <u>Bayes.</u>     35

<br>
 <small>A POEM</small><br>

<pre>
<u>OF old, when Scarron his companions invited,</u>
<u>Each guest brought his dish,</u> and the feast was united;
<u>If our landlord</u> supplies us with beef, and with fish,
Let each guest bring himself, and he brings the best dish:
<u>Our Dean</u> shall be venison, just fresh from the plains;      5
<u>Our Burke</u> shall be tongue, with a garnish of brains;
<u>Our Will</u> shall be wild-fowl, of excellent flavour,
<u>And Dick</u> with his pepper shall heighten their savour:
<u>Our Cumberland's sweet-bread</u> its place shall obtain,
And <u>Douglas</u> is pudding, substantial and plain:             10
Our Garrick's a salad; for in him we see
Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree:
To make out the dinner, full certain I am,
That <u>Ridge</u> is anchovy, and Reynolds is lamb;
That <u>Hickey's</u> a capon, and by the same rule,               15
<u>Magnanimous Goldsmith</u> a gooseberry fool.
At a dinner so various, at such a repast,
Who'd not be a glutton, and stick to the last?
Here, waiter! more wine, let me sit while I'm able,
Till all my companions sink under the table;               20
Then, with chaos and blunders encircling my head,
Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead.
    
  Here lies the good Dean, re-united to earth,
Who mix'd reason with pleasure, and wisdom with mirth:
If he had any faults, he has left us in doubt,             25
At least, in six weeks, I could not find 'em out;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
Yet some have declar'd, and it can't be denied 'em,
That sly-boots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em.
    
  Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such,
We scarcely can praise it, or blame it too much;           30
Who, born for the Universe, narrow'd his mind,
And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.
Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat
To persuade <u>Tommy Townshend</u> to lend him a vote;
Who, <u>too deep for his hearers,</u> still went on refining,     35
<u>And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;</u>
Though equal to all things, for all things unfit,
Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit:
For a patriot, too cool; for a drudge, disobedient;
And too fond of the <i>right</i> to pursue the <i>expedient.</i>         40
In short, 'twas his fate, unemploy'd, or in place, Sir,
<u>To eat mutton cold,</u> and cut blocks with a razor.
    
  Here lies <u>honest William,</u> whose heart was a mint,
While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't;
The pupil of impulse, it forc'd him along,                 45
His conduct still right, with his argument wrong;
Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam,
The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home;
Would you ask for his merits? alas! he had none;
What was good was spontaneous, his faults were his own.    50
    
  Here lies honest Richard, whose fate I must sigh at;
Alas, that such frolic should now be so quiet!
What spirits were his! what wit and what whim!
<u>Now breaking a jest, and now breaking a limb;</u>

Now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball,           55
Now teasing and vexing, yet laughing at all!
In short, so provoking a devil was Dick,
That we wish'd him full ten times a day at Old Nick;
But, missing his mirth and agreeable vein,
As often we wish'd to have Dick back again.                60

  <u>Here Cumberland lies,</u> having acted his parts,
The Terence of England, the mender of hearts;
A flattering painter, who made it his care
To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are.
His gallants are all faultless, his women divine,          65
<u>And comedy wonders at being so fine;</u>
Like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,
Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.
His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd
Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud;           70
And coxcombs, alike in their failings alone,
Adopting his portraits, are pleas'd with their own.
Say, where has our poet this malady caught?
Or, wherefore his characters thus without fault?
Say, was it that vainly directing his view                 75
To find out men's virtues, and finding them few,
Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,
He grew lazy at last, and drew from himself?

  Here Douglas retires, from his toils to relax,
<u>The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks:</u>            80
Come, all ye quack bards, and ye quacking divines,
Come, and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines:
When Satire and Censure encircl'd his throne,
I fear'd for your safety, I fear'd for my own;

But now he is gone, and we want a detector,                85
<u>Our Dodds shall be pious,</u> <u>our Kenricks</u> shall lecture;
<u>Macpherson</u> write bombast, and call it a style,
<u>Our Townshend</u> make speeches, and I shall compile;
<u>New Lauders and Bowers</u> the Tweed shall cross over,
No countryman living their tricks to discover;             90
Detection her taper shall quench to a spark,
<u>And Scotchman meet Scotchman, and cheat in the dark.</u>

  <u>Here lies David Garrick,</u> describe me, who can,
An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;
As an actor, confess'd without rival to shine:             95
As a wit, if not first, in the very first line:
Yet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart,
The man had his failings, a dupe to his art.
Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread,
And beplaster'd with rouge his own natural red.           100
On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;
'Twas only that when he was off he was acting.
With no reason on earth to go out of his way,
He turn'd and he varied full ten times a day.
Though secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick        105
If they were not his own by finessing and trick,
He cast off his friends, as a huntsman his pack,
For he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back.
Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what came,
And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;           110
Till his relish grown callous, almost to disease,
Who pepper'd the highest was surest to please.

But let us be candid, and speak out our mind,
If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.
<u>Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys,</u> and <u>Woodfalls</u> so grave,           115
What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave!
How did Grub-street re-echo the shouts you rais'd,
While he was be-Roscius'd, and you were be-prais'd!
But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,
<u>To act as an angel,</u> and mix with the skies:               120
Those poets, who owe their best fame to his skill,
Shall still be his flatterers, go where he will.
Old Shakespeare, receive him, with praise and with love,
And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.
                   
  <u>Here Hickey reclines,</u> a most blunt, pleasant creature,  125
And slander itself must allow him good nature:
He cherish'd his friend, and he relish'd a bumper;
Yet one fault he had, and that one was a thumper.
Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser!
I answer, no, no, for he always was wiser:                130
Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat?
His very worst foe can't accuse him of that:
Perhaps he confided in men as they go,
And so was too foolishly honest! Ah no!
Then what was his failing? come, tell it, and <u>burn ye!</u>    135
He was, could he help it?&mdash;<u>a special attorney.</u>
         
  <u>Here Reynolds is laid,</u> and, to tell you my mind,
He has not left a better or wiser behind:
His pencil was striking, resistless, and grand;
His manners were gentle, complying, and <u>bland</u>;            140

Still born to improve us in every part,
His pencil our faces, his manners our heart:
To coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,

When they talk'd of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff, 145
<u>He shifted his trumpet,</u> <u>and only took snuff.</u>

<center>POSTSCRIPT<br>
</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">After the Fourth Edition of this Poem was
printed, the Publisher received an Epitaph on Mr. Whitefoord, from
a friend of the late Doctor Goldsmith, inclosed in a letter, of
which the following is an abstract:&mdash;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">'I have in my possession a sheet of paper,
containing near forty lines in the Doctor's own hand-writing: there
are many scattered, broken verses, on Sir Jos. Reynolds, Counsellor
Ridge, Mr. Beauclerk, and Mr. Whitefoord. The Epitaph on the
last-mentioned gentleman is the only one that is finished, and
therefore I have copied it, that you may add it to the next
edition. It is a striking proof of Doctor Goldsmith's good-nature.

     AH me! when shall I marry me?
       Lovers are plenty; but fail to relieve me:
     He, fond youth, that could carry me,
       Offers to love, but means to deceive me.
     
     But I will rally, and combat the ruiner:                5
       Not a look, not a smile shall my passion discover:

       Makes but a penitent, loses a lover.

     CHASTE are their instincts, faithful is their fire,
     No foreign beauty tempts to false desire;
     The snow-white vesture, and the glittering crown,
     The simple plumage, or the glossy down
     Prompt not their loves:&mdash;the patriot bird pursues         5
     His well acquainted tints, and kindred hues.
     Hence through their tribes no mix'd polluted flame,
     No monster-breed to mark the groves with shame;
     But the chaste blackbird, to its partner true,
     Thinks black alone is beauty's favourite hue.           10
     The nightingale, with mutual passion blest,
     Sings to its mate, and nightly charms the nest;
     While the dark owl to court its partner flies,
     And owns its offspring in their yellow eyes.

<center><b>THE HAUNCH OF VENISON</b><br>
<br>
 <small>A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE</small><br>
</center>

<pre>
THANKS, my Lord, for your venison, for finer or fatter
Never rang'd in a forest, or smok'd in a platter;
The haunch was a picture for painters to study,
<u>The fat was so white,</u> and the lean was so ruddy.
<u>Though my stomach was sharp,</u> I could scarce help regretting  5
To spoil such a delicate picture by eating;
I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,
To be shown to my friends as a piece of <i>virt&ugrave;</i>;
As in some Irish houses, where things are so so,
<u>One gammon of bacon</u> hangs up for a show:                    10
But for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,
They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in.
But hold&mdash;let me pause&mdash;Don't I hear you pronounce
This tale of the bacon a damnable bounce?
Well, suppose it <u>a bounce</u>&mdash;sure a poet may try,              15
By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.

  But, my Lord, it's no bounce:  I protest in my turn,
It's a truth&mdash;and your Lordship may ask <u>Mr. Byrne.</u>
To go on with my tale&mdash;as I gaz'd on the haunch,
I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch;          20
So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undress'd,
To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik'd best.
Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;
'Twas a neck and a breast&mdash;that might rival
<u>M&mdash;r&mdash;'s</u>:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
But in parting with these I was puzzled again,              25
With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when.
<u>There's H&mdash;d, and C&mdash;y, and H&mdash;rth, and H&mdash;ff,</u>
I think they love venison&mdash;I know they love beef;
There's my countryman <u>H&mdash;gg&mdash;ns</u>&mdash;Oh! let him
alone,
For making a blunder, or picking a bone.                    30
But hang it&mdash;to poets who seldom can eat,
Your very good mutton's a very good treat;
<u>Such dainties to them,</u> their health it might hurt,
It's like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.
While thus I debated, in reverie centred,                   35
An acquaintance, a friend as he call'd himself, enter'd;
<u>An under-bred, fine-spoken fellow was he,</u>
And he smil'd as he look'd at the venison and me.
'What have we got here?&mdash;Why, this is good eating!
Your own, I suppose&mdash;or is it in waiting?'                   40
'Why, whose should it be?' cried I with a flounce,
'I get these things often;'&mdash;but that was a bounce:
'Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,
Are pleas'd to be kind&mdash;<u>but I hate ostentation.</u>'

  'If that be the case, then,' cried he, very gay,          45
'I'm glad I have taken this house in my way.
To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;
No words&mdash;I insist on't&mdash;precisely at three:
<u>We'll have Johnson, and Burke;</u> all the wits will be there;
My acquaintance is slight, or I'd ask my Lord Clare.        50
And now that I think on't, as I am a sinner!
We wanted this venison to make out the dinner.

<u>What say you&mdash;a pasty? it shall, and it must,</u>
And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust.
Here, porter!&mdash;this venison with me to Mile-end;             55
<u>No stirring&mdash;I beg&mdash;my dear friend&mdash;my dear friend!</u>
Thus snatching his hat, he brush'd off like the wind,
And the porter and eatables follow'd behind.

  Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,
<u>'And nobody with me at sea but myself';</u>                     60
Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,
Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,
Were things that I never dislik'd in my life,
Though clogg'd with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife.
So next day, in due splendour to make my approach,          65
I drove to his door in my own hackney coach.

  <u>When come to the place</u> where we all were to dine,
(A chair-lumber'd closet just twelve feet by nine:)
My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb,
With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come;         70
'For I knew it,' he cried, 'both eternally fail,
The one with his speeches, <u>and t'other with Thrale;</u>
But no matter, I'll warrant we'll make up the party
With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.
The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,                    75
<u>They['re] both of them merry and authors like you;</u>
The one writes the <i>Snarler</i>, the other the <i>Scourge</i>;
<u>Some think he writes <i>Cinna</i>&mdash;he owns to <i>Panurge.</i></u>'
While thus he describ'd them by trade, and by name,
They enter'd and dinner was serv'd as they came.            80

  At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen,
At the bottom was tripe in a <u>swinging</u> tureen;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot;
In the middle a place where the <u>pasty</u>&mdash;was not.
Now, my Lord as for tripe, it's my utter aversion,          85
And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;
<u>So there I sat</u> stuck, like a horse in a pound,
While the bacon and liver went merrily round.
But what vex'd me most was that d&mdash;'d Scottish rogue,
With his long-winded speeches, his smiles and his brogue;   90
<u>And, 'Madam,' quoth he,</u> <u>'may this bit be my poison,</u>
A prettier dinner I never set eyes on;
Pray a slice of your liver, though may I be curs'd,
But I've eat of your tripe till I'm ready to burst.'
<u>'The tripe,' quoth the Jew,</u> with his chocolate cheek,       95
'I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week:
I like these here dinners so pretty and small;
But your friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.'
'O&mdash;Oh!' quoth my friend, 'he'll come on in a trice,
He's keeping a corner for something that's nice:           100
There's a pasty'&mdash;'A pasty!' repeated the Jew,
'I don't care if I keep a corner for't too.'
'What the de'il, mon, a pasty!' <u>re-echoed</u> the Scot,
'Though splitting, I'll still keep a corner for <u>thot.</u>'
'We'll all keep a corner,' the lady cried out;             105
'We'll all keep a corner,' was echoed about.
While thus we resolv'd, and the pasty delay'd,
With look that quite petrified, enter'd the maid;
A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,
<u>Wak'd Priam</u> in drawing his curtains by night.              110
But we quickly found out, for who could mistake her?
That she came with some terrible news from the baker:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
And so it fell out, for that negligent sloven
Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven
Sad Philomel thus&mdash;but let similes drop&mdash;                    115
And now that I think on't, the story may stop.
To be plain, my good Lord, it's but labour misplac'd
To send such good verses to one of your taste;
You've got an odd something&mdash;a kind of discerning&mdash;
A relish&mdash;a taste&mdash;<u>sicken'd over by learning;</u>               
120
At least, it's your temper, <u>as very well known,</u>
That you think very slightly of all that's your own:
So, perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiss,
You may make a mistake, and think slightly of this.

<center><b>EPILOGUE FOR MR. LEE LEWES</b><br>
</center>

<pre>
     HOLD! Prompter, hold! a word before your nonsense;
     I'd speak a word or two, to ease my conscience.
     My pride forbids it ever should be said,
     My heels eclips'd the honours of my head;
     That I found humour in a piebald vest,                  5
     Or ever thought that jumping was a jest.
                                (<i>Takes off his mask.</i>)
     Whence, and what art thou, visionary birth?
     Nature disowns, and reason scorns thy mirth,
     <u>In thy black aspect</u> every passion sleeps,
     The joy that dimples, and the woe that weeps.          10
     How has thou fill'd the scene with all thy brood,
     Of fools pursuing, and of fools pursu'd!
     Whose ins and outs no ray of sense discloses,
     Whose only plot it is to break our noses;
     Whilst from below the trap-door Demons rise,           15
     And from above the dangling deities;
     And shall I mix in this unhallow'd crew?
     May <u>rosined lightning</u> blast me, if I do!
     No&mdash;I will act, I'll vindicate the stage:
     Shakespeare himself shall feel my tragic rage.         20
     Off! off! vile trappings! a new passion reigns!
     The madd'ning monarch revels in my veins.
     Oh! for a Richard's voice to catch the theme:
     'Give me another horse! bind up my wounds!&mdash;soft&mdash;
       'twas but a dream.'
     Aye, 'twas but a dream, for now there's no retreating: 25
     If I cease Harlequin, I cease from eating.

     'Twas thus that Aesop's stag, a creature blameless,
     Yet something vain, like one that shall be nameless,
     Once on the margin of a fountain stood,
     And cavill'd at his image in the flood.                30
     'The deuce confound,' he cries, 'these drumstick shanks,
     They never have my gratitude nor thanks;
     They're perfectly disgraceful! strike me dead!
     But for a head, yes, yes, I have a head.
     How piercing is that eye! how sleek that brow!         35
     My horns! I'm told horns are the fashion now.'
     Whilst thus he spoke, astonish'd, to his view,
     Near, and more near, the hounds and huntsmen drew.
     'Hoicks! hark forward!' came thund'ring from behind,
     He bounds aloft, outstrips the fleeting wind:          40
     He quits the woods, and tries the beaten ways;
     He starts, he pants, he takes the circling maze.
     At length his silly head, so priz'd before,
     Is taught his former folly to deplore;
     Whilst his strong limbs conspire to set him free,      45
     And at one bound he saves himself,&mdash;like me.

          Lend me your hands.&mdash;Oh! fatal news to tell:          35

          Ay, take your travellers, travellers indeed!
          Give me my bonny Scot, that travels from the Tweed.
          Where are the chiels? Ah! Ah, I well discern
          The smiling looks of each bewitching bairn.          40

          My voice shall be ready to carol away

          Ye brave Irish lads, hark away to the crack,

<center><b>EPILOGUE</b><br>
<br>
 <small>INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN FOR<br>
'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER'</small></center>

<pre>
     <u>THERE is a place, so Ariosto sings,</u>
     A treasury for lost and missing things;
     Lost human wits have places assign'd them,
     And they, who lose their senses, there may find them.
     But where's this place, this storehouse of the age?        5
     The Moon, says he:&mdash;but <i>I</i> affirm the Stage:
     At least in many things, I think, I see
     His lunar, and our mimic world agree.
     Both shine at night, for, but <u>at Foote's alone,</u>
     We scarce exhibit till the sun goes down.                 10
     Both prone to change, no settled limits fix,
     And sure the folks of both are lunatics.
     But in this parallel my best pretence is,
     That mortals visit both to find their senses.
     To this strange spot, Rakes, Macaronies, Cits             15
     Come thronging to collect their scatter'd wits.
     The gay coquette, who ogles all the day,
     Comes here at night, and goes a prude away.
     Hither the affected city dame advancing,
     Who sighs for operas, and dotes on dancing,               20
     Taught by our art her ridicule to pause on,
     Quits the <i>Ballet</i>, and calls for <i>Nancy Dawson.</i>
     The Gamester too, whose wit's all high or low,
     Oft risks his fortune on one desperate throw,
     Comes here to saunter, having made his bets,              25
     Finds his lost senses out, and pay his debts.

     <u>The Mohawk</u> too&mdash;with angry phrases stored,
     As 'D&mdash; &mdash;, Sir,' and 'Sir, I wear a sword';
     Here lesson'd for a while, and hence retreating,
     Goes out, affronts his man, and takes a beating.         30
     Here come the sons of scandal and of news,
     But find no sense&mdash;for they had none to lose.
     Of all the tribe here wanting an adviser
     Our Author's the least likely to grow wiser;
     Has he not seen how you your favour place,               35
     On sentimental Queens and Lords in lace?
     Without a star, a coronet or garter,
     How can the piece expect or hope for quarter?
     No high-life scenes, no sentiment:&mdash;the creature
     <u>Still stoops among the low to copy nature.</u>               40
     Yes, he's far gone:&mdash;and yet some pity fix,
     The English laws forbid to punish lunatics.
