<p>
<H2>Psalm 1</H2>

<p>
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Blessed is the man who
doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked,
<dd>nor stand in the way of sinners,
<dd>nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> but his delight is in
Yahweh's law.
<dd>On his law he meditates day and night.
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> He will be like a tree
planted by the streams of water,
<dd>that brings forth its fruit in its season,
<dd>whose leaf also does not wither.
<dd>Whatever he does shall prosper.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> The wicked are not so,
<dd>but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Therefore the wicked
shall not stand in the judgment,
<dd>nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> For Yahweh knows the
way of the righteous,
<dd>but the way of the wicked shall perish.

<p>
<H2>Psalm 2</H2>
<dl><dt> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Why do the nations
rage,
<dd>and the peoples plot a vain thing?
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The kings of the earth
take a stand,
<dd>and the rulers take counsel together,
<dd>against Yahweh, and against his <a href="#N1">Anointed,</a> saying,
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> &quot;Let's break
their bonds apart,
<dd>and cast their cords from us.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> He who sits in the
heavens will laugh.
<dd>The Lord will have them in derision.
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Then he will speak to
them in his anger,
<dd>and terrify them in his wrath:
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> &quot;Yet I have set
my king on my holy hill of Zion.&quot;
<dd> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> I will tell of the
decree.
<dt>Yahweh said to me, &quot;You are my son.
<dd>Today I have become your father.
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Ask of me, and I will
give the nations for your inheritance,
<dd>the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> You shall break them
with a rod of iron.
<dd>You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Now therefore be
wise, you kings.
<dd>Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Serve Yahweh with
fear,
<dd>and rejoice with trembling.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> <a href="#N2">Give
sincere homage</a>, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
<dd>for his wrath will soon be kindled.

of my soul,

<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> But you, Yahweh, are a
shield around me,
<dd>my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> I cry to Yahweh with
my voice,
<dd>and he answers me out of his holy hill.
<dt>Selah.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> I laid myself down and
slept.
<dd>I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> I will not be afraid
of tens of thousands of people
<dd>who have set themselves against me on every side.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Arise, Yahweh!
<dd>Save me, my God!
<dt>For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.

<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Salvation belongs to
Yahweh.

<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> You sons of men, how
long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
<dd>Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
<dt>Selah.
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> But know that Yahweh
has set apart for himself him who is godly:
<dd>Yahweh will hear when I call to him.
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Stand in awe, and
don't sin.
<dd>Search your own heart on your bed, and be still.
<dt>Selah.
<dt> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Offer the sacrifices
of righteousness.

<dt> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Many say, &quot;Who
will show us any good?&quot;
<dd>Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.
<dt> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> You have put gladness
in my heart,
<dd>more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> In peace I will both
lay myself down and sleep,

<p>For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.
<p>
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Give ear to my words,
Yahweh.
<dd>Consider my meditation.
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Listen to the voice of
my cry, my King and my God;
<dd>for to you do I pray.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Yahweh, in the morning
you shall hear my voice.
<dd>In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch
expectantly.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> For you are not a God
who has pleasure in wickedness.
<dd>Evil can't live with you.
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> The arrogant shall not
stand in your sight.
<dd>You hate all workers of iniquity.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> You will destroy those
who speak lies.
<dd>Yahweh abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> But as for me, in the
abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.
<dd>I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Lead me, Yahweh, in
your righteousness because of my enemies.
<dd>Make your way straight before my face.
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> For there is no
faithfulness in their mouth.
<dd>Their heart is destruction.
<dd>Their throat is an open tomb.
<dd>They flatter with their tongue.
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Hold them guilty, God.
<dd>Let them fall by their own counsels;
<dt>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,
<dd>for they have rebelled against you.
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> But let all those who
take refuge in you rejoice,
<dd>Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.
<dt>Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
<dd> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> For you will bless
the righteous.

great anguish.

Deliver my soul,
<dd>and save me for your loving kindness' sake.
<dt> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> For in death there is
no memory of you.
<dd>In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?
<dt> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> I am weary with my
groaning.
<dd>Every night I flood my bed.
<dd>I drench my couch with my tears.
<dt> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> My eye wastes away
because of grief.
<dd>It grows old because of all my adversaries.
<dt> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Depart from me, all
you workers of iniquity,

<dt> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> May all my enemies be
ashamed and dismayed.
<dd>They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

refuge in you.
<dd>Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
<dt> <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> lest they tear apart
my soul like a lion,

anger.

<dt> <a name="C78V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:56</font></a> Yet they tempted and
rebelled against the Most High God,
<dd>and didn't keep his testimonies;
<dt> <a name="C78V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:57</font></a> but turned back, and
dealt treacherously like their fathers.
<dd>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
<dt> <a name="C78V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:58</font></a> For they provoked
him to anger with their high places,

<dt> <a name="C78V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:59</font></a> When God heard this,
he was angry,

the tent of Shiloh,

strength into captivity,

awakened as one out of sleep,

adversaries backward.
<dd>He put them to a perpetual reproach.
<dt> <a name="C78V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:67</font></a> Moreover he rejected
the tent of Joseph,
<dd>and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,

sanctuary like the heights,

<dt> <a name="C78V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">78:70</font></a> He also chose David

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>

that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>

efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
