<h1>
Paul's Letter to the Colossians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to the saints and faithful <a
href="#N1">brothers</a> in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from
God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> We give thanks to God
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> having heard of your faith in
Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
 <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> because of the hope which
is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word
of the truth of the Good News,  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> which has come to you; even as it
is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you
also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> even as you learned of Epaphras
our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our
behalf,  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> who also declared
to us your love in the Spirit.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> For this cause, we also, since the
day we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that
you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom
and understanding,  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> that
you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing
fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> strengthened with all power,
according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance
with joy;  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> giving thanks
to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the
saints in light;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> who
delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the
Kingdom of the Son of his love;  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> in whom we have our
redemption,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font> the forgiveness of our sins;  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> who is the image of the invisible
God, the firstborn of all creation.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> For by him all things were
created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things
invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all
things have been created through him, and for him.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> He is before all things, and in
him all things are held together.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> He is the head of the body, the
assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all
things he might have the preeminence.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> For all the fullness was pleased
to dwell in him;  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> and
through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on
the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood
of his cross.
<p> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> You, being in past
times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> yet now he has reconciled in the
body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish
and blameless before him,  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> if it is so that you continue in
the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under
heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
<p> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Now I rejoice in my
sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of
the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the
assembly;  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> of which I was
made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me
toward you, to fulfill the word of God,  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> the mystery which has been hidden
for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,
 <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> to whom God was pleased
to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the
Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> whom we proclaim, admonishing
every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every
man perfect in Christ Jesus;  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> for which I also labor, striving
according to his working, which works in me mightily.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> For I desire to have
you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and
for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> that their hearts may be
comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the
full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God,
both of the Father and of Christ,  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> in whom are all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge hidden.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Now this I say that no one may
delude you with persuasiveness of speech.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For though I am absent in the
flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order,
and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> As therefore you received Christ
Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> rooted and built up in him, and
established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in
thanksgiving.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Be careful
that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit,
after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after
Christ.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> For in him all the
fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> and in him you are made full, who
is the head of all principality and power;  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> in whom you were also circumcised
with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of
the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> having been buried with him in
baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the
working of God, who raised him from the dead.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> You were dead through your
trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive
together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> wiping out the handwriting in
ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way,
nailing it to the cross;  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> having stripped the
principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing
over them in it.
<p> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Let no man therefore
judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a
new moon or a Sabbath day,  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> which are a shadow of the things
to come; but the body is Christ's.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Let no one rob you of your prize
by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the
things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
 <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> and not holding firmly to
the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through
the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> If you died with Christ from the
elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject
yourselves to ordinances,  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> &quot;Don't handle, nor taste,
nor touch&quot;  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> (all of
which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?
 <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Which things indeed
appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to
the body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> If then you were raised
together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is,
seated on the right hand of God.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Set your mind on the things that
are above, not on the things that are on the earth.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> For you died, and your life is
hidden with Christ in God.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> When Christ, our life, is
revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Put to death therefore your
members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved
passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> for which things' sake the wrath
of God comes on the children of disobedience.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> You also once walked in those,
when you lived in them;  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> but now you also put them all
away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your
mouth.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Don't lie to one
another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> and have put on the new man, who
is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> where there can't be Greek and
Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant,
freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Put on therefore, as
God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness,
lowliness, humility, and perseverance;  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> bearing with one another, and
forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as
Christ forgave you, so you also do.
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Above all these
things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> And let the peace of God rule in
your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.
 <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Let the word of Christ
dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another
with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart
to the Lord.
<p> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Whatever you do, in
word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
God the Father, through him.
<p> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Wives, be in
subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
<p> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Husbands, love your
wives, and don't be bitter against them.
<p> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> Children, obey your
parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.
<p> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Fathers, don't provoke
your children, so that they won't be discouraged.
<p> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Servants, obey in all
things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when
they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing
God.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> And whatever you do,
work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> knowing that from the Lord you
will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
 <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> But he who does wrong
will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no
partiality.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Masters, give to your
servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master
in heaven.
<p> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Continue steadfastly in
prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> praying together for us also, that
God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ,
for which I am also in bonds;  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> that I may reveal it as I ought to
speak.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Walk in wisdom
toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Let your speech always be with
grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each
one.
<p> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> All my affairs will be
made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and
fellow bondservant in the Lord.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> I am sending him to you for this
very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,
 <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> together with Onesimus,
the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known
to you everything that is going on here.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner
greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received
commandments, &quot;if he comes to you, receive him&quot;),  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> and Jesus who is called Justus,
who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the
Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.
<p> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Epaphras, who is one
of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his
prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
 <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> For I testify about him,
that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those
in Hierapolis.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Luke, the
beloved physician, and Demas greet you.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Greet the brothers who are in
Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> When this letter has been read
among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and
that you also read the letter from Laodicea.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Tell Archippus, &quot;Take heed
to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> The salutation of me,
Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web5110h.htm or web5110h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web5111h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web5110ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>

<p>Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment<br>
method other than by check or money order.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by<br>
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be<br>
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.<br>
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

receive it electronically.</p>
