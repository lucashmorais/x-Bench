<h1>
Isaiah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The vision of Isaiah the
son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Hear, heavens,
<dd>and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
<dt>I have nourished and brought up children,
<dd>and they have rebelled against me.
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> The ox knows his owner,
<dd>and the donkey his master's crib;
<dd>but Israel doesn't know,
<dd>my people don't consider.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Ah sinful nation,
<dd>a people loaded with iniquity,
<dd>a seed of evil-doers,
<dd>children who deal corruptly!
<dt>They have forsaken Yahweh.
<dd>They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
<dd>They are estranged and backward.
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Why should you be
beaten more,
<dd>that you revolt more and more?
<dt>The whole head is sick,
<dd>and the whole heart faint.
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> From the sole of the
foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:
<dd>wounds, welts, and open sores.
<dd>They haven't been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Your country is
desolate.
<dd>Your cities are burned with fire.
<dd>Strangers devour your land in your presence,
<dd>and it is desolate,
<dd>as overthrown by strangers.
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> The daughter of Zion
is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
<dd>like a hut in a field of melons,
<dd>like a besieged city.
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Unless Yahweh of
Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
<dd>we would have been as Sodom;
<dd>we would have been like Gomorrah.
<dt> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Hear the word of
Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!
<dd>Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> &quot;What are the
multitude of your sacrifices to me?,&quot; says Yahweh.
<dd>&quot;I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,
<dd>and the fat of fed animals.
<dd>I don't delight in the blood of bulls,
<dd>or of lambs,
<dd>or of male goats.
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> When you come to
appear before me,
<dd>who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
<dt> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Bring no more vain
offerings.
<dd>Incense is an abomination to me;
<dd>new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:
<dd>I can't bear with evil assemblies.
<dt> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> My soul hates your
New Moons and your appointed feasts.
<dd>They are a burden to me.
<dd>I am weary of bearing them.
<dt> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> When you spread forth
your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
<dd>Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
<dd>Your hands are full of blood.
<dt> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Wash yourselves, make
yourself clean.
<dd>Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.
<dd>Cease to do evil.
<dt> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Learn to do well.
<dd>Seek justice.
<dd>Relieve the oppressed.
<dd>Judge the fatherless.
<dd>Plead for the widow.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> &quot;Come now, and
let us reason together,&quot; says Yahweh:
<dd>&quot;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
<dd>Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<dt> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> If you are willing
and obedient,
<dd>you shall eat the good of the land;
<dd> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> but if you refuse and
rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
<dd>for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> How the faithful city
has become a prostitute!
<dd>She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her,
<dd>but now murderers.
<dt> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Your silver has
become dross,
<dd>your wine mixed with water.
<dt> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> Your princes are
rebellious, and companions of thieves.
<dd>Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
<dd>They don't judge the fatherless,
<dd>neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
<dt> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Therefore the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies,
<dd>the Mighty One of Israel, says:
<dt>&quot;Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
<dd>and avenge myself of my enemies;
<dt> <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> and I will turn my
hand on you,
<dd>thoroughly purge away your dross,
<dd>and will take away all your tin.
<dt> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> I will restore your
judges as at the first,
<dd>and your counselors as at the beginning.
<dt>Afterward you shall be called 'The city of righteousness,
<dd>a faithful town.'
<dt> <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> Zion shall be
redeemed with justice,
<dd>and her converts with righteousness.
<dt> <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> But the destruction
of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
<dd>and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
<dt> <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> For they shall be
ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
<dd>and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
<dt> <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> For you shall be as
an oak whose leaf fades,
<dd>and as a garden that has no water.
<dt> <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> The strong will be
like tinder,
<dd>and his work like a spark.
<dt>They will both burn together,
<dd>and no one will quench them.&quot;
<dt>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> This is what Isaiah the
son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> It shall happen in the
latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's house shall be established on
the top of the mountains,
<dd>and shall be raised above the hills;
<dd>and all nations shall flow to it.
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Many peoples shall go
and say,
<dd>&quot;Come, let's go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
<dd>to the house of the God of Jacob;
<dd>and he will teach us of his ways,
<dd>and we will walk in his paths.&quot;
<dt>For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
<dd>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> He will judge between
the nations,
<dd>and will decide concerning many peoples;
<dd>and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
<dd>and their spears into pruning hooks.
<dt>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
<dd>neither shall they learn war any more.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> House of Jacob, come,
and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> For you have forsaken
your people, the house of Jacob,
<dd>because they are filled from the east,
<dd>with those who practice divination like the Philistines,
<dd>and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Their land is full of
silver and gold,
<dd>neither is there any end of their treasures.
<dt>Their land also is full of horses,
<dd>neither is there any end of their chariots.
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Their land also is
full of idols.
<dd>They worship the work of their own hands,
<dd>that which their own fingers have made.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Man is brought low,
<dd>and mankind is humbled;
<dd>therefore don't forgive them.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Enter into the rock,
<dd>and hide in the dust,
<dt>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> The lofty looks of
man will be brought low,
<dd>the haughtiness of men will be bowed down,
<dd>and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> For there will be a
day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty,
<dd>and for all that is lifted up;
<dd>and it shall be brought low:
<dd> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For all the cedars of
Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
<dd>for all the oaks of Bashan,
<dd> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> For all the high
mountains,
<dd>for all the hills that are lifted up,
<dd> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> For every lofty tower,
<dd>for every fortified wall,
<dd> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> For all the ships of
Tarshish,
<dd>and for all pleasant imagery.
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> The loftiness of man
shall be bowed down,
<dd>and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
<dd>and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> The idols shall
utterly pass away.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Men shall go into the
caves of the rocks,
<dd>and into the holes of the earth,
<dd>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty,
<dd>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> In that day, men
shall cast away their idols of silver,
<dd>and their idols of gold,
<dd>which have been made for themselves to worship,
<dd>to the moles and to the bats;
<dd> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> To go into the
caverns of the rocks,
<dd>and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
<dd>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty,
<dd>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
<dt> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Stop trusting in man,
whose breath is in his nostrils;
<dd>for of what account is he?
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> For, behold, the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and
support,
<dd>the whole supply of bread,
<dd>and the whole supply of water;
<dd> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> the mighty man,
<dd>the man of war,
<dd>the judge,
<dd>the prophet,
<dd>the diviner,
<dd>the elder,
<dd> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> the captain of fifty,
<dd>the honorable man,
<dd>the counselor,
<dd>the skilled craftsman,
<dd>and the clever enchanter.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> I will give boys to be
their princes,
<dd>and children shall rule over them.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> The people will be
oppressed,
<dd>everyone by another,
<dd>and everyone by his neighbor.
<dt>The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,
<dd>and the base against the honorable.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Indeed a man shall
take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,
<dd>&quot;You have clothing, you be our ruler,
<dd>and let this ruin be under your hand.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> In that day he will
cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;
<dd>for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
<dd>You shall not make me ruler of the people.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> For Jerusalem is
ruined, and Judah is fallen;
<dd>because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,
<dt>to provoke the eyes of his glory.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> The look of their
faces testify against them.
<dd>They parade their sin like Sodom.
<dd>They don't hide it.
<dd>Woe to their soul!
<dd>For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Tell the righteous
&quot;Good!&quot;
<dd>For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Woe to the wicked!
<dd>Disaster is upon them;
<dd>for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> As for my people,
children are their oppressors,
<dd>and women rule over them.
<dd>My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
<dd>and destroy the way of your paths.
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Yahweh stands up to
contend,
<dd>and stands to judge the peoples.
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Yahweh will enter
into judgment with the elders of his people,
<dd>and their leaders:
<dd>&quot;It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
<dd>The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
<dd> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> What do you mean that
you crush my people,
<dd>and grind the face of the poor?&quot; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Moreover Yahweh said,
&quot;Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
<dd>and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
<dd>walking to trip as they go,
<dd>jingling ornaments on their feet;
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> therefore the Lord
brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,
<dd>and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> In that day the Lord
will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent
necklaces,  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> the earrings,
the bracelets, the veils,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> the headdresses, the ankle
chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> the signet rings, the nose rings,
 <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> the fine robes, the
capes, the cloaks, the purses,  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> the hand mirrors, the fine linen
garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> It shall happen that
instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;
<dd>instead of a belt, a rope;
<dd>instead of well set hair, baldness;
<dd>instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth;
<dd>and branding instead of beauty.
<dt> <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Your men shall fall
by the sword,
<dd>and your mighty in the war.
<dt> <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> Her gates shall
lament and mourn;
<dd>and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Seven women shall take
hold of one man in that day, saying, &quot;We will eat our own bread, and
wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our
reproach.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> In that day, Yahweh's
branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be
the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> It will happen, that he who is
left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> when the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood
of Jerusalem from its midst, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit
of burning.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Yahweh will
create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a
cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for
over all the glory will be a canopy.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> There will be a pavilion for a
shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter
from storm and from rain.
<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Let me sing for my
well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.
<dd>My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> He dug it up,
<dd>gathered out its stones,
<dd>planted it with the choicest vine,
<dd>built a tower in its midst,
<dd>and also cut out a winepress therein.
<dt>He looked for it to yield grapes,
<dd>but it yielded wild grapes.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> &quot;Now, inhabitants
of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
<dd>please judge between me and my vineyard.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> What could have been
done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
<dd>Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Now I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard.
<dd>I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
<dd>I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> I will lay it a
wasteland.
<dd>It won't be pruned nor hoed,
<dd>but it will grow briers and thorns.
<dd>I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> For the vineyard of
Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
<dd>and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
<dd>and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;
<dd>for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Woe to those who join
house to house,
<dd>who lay field to field, until there is no room,
<dd>and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> In my ears, Yahweh of
Armies says: &quot;Surely many houses will be desolate,
<dd>even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> For <a href="#N1">ten
acres</a> of vineyard shall yield <a href="#N2">one bath,</a>
<dd>and a <a href="#N3">homer</a> of seed shall yield an <a
href="#N4">ephah.</a>&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Woe to those who rise
up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink;
<dd>who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> The harp, lyre,
tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;
<dd>but they don't regard the work of Yahweh,
<dd>neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Therefore my people
go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
<dd>Their honorable men are famished,
<dd>and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
<dt> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Therefore <a
href="#N5">Sheol</a> has enlarged its desire,
<dd>and opened its mouth without measure;
<dd>and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices
among them, descend into it.
<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> So man is brought low,
<dd>mankind is humbled,
<dd>and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
<dt> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> but Yahweh of Armies
is exalted in justice,
<dd>and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
<dt> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Then the lambs will
graze as in their pasture,
<dd>and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Woe to those who draw
iniquity with cords of falsehood,
<dd>and wickedness as with cart rope;
<dt> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Who say, &quot;Let
him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;
<dd>and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
<dd>that we may know it!&quot;
<dt> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Woe to those who call
evil good, and good evil;

<dt>because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
<dd>and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Therefore Yahweh's
anger burns against his people,
<dd>and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.
<dt>The mountains tremble,
<dd>and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets.
<dt>For all this, his anger is not turned away,

<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> In the year that king
Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and
his train filled the temple.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Above him stood the seraphim. Each
one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his
feet. With two he flew.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> One called to another, and said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!
<dd>The whole earth is full of his glory!&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> The foundations of the
thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled
with smoke.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Then I said,
&quot;Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and
I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen
the King, Yahweh of Armies!&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Then one of the
seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken
with the tongs from off the altar.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> He touched my mouth with it, and
said, &quot;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken
away, and your sin forgiven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> I heard the Lord's
voice, saying, &quot;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&quot;
<p>Then I said, &quot;Here I am. Send me!&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> He said, &quot;Go, and
tell this people,
<dl>
<dt>'You hear indeed,
<dd>but don't understand;
<dt>and you see indeed,
<dd>but don't perceive.'
<dt> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Make the heart of
this people fat.
<dd>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
<dt>lest they see with their eyes,
<dd>and hear with their ears,
<dd>and understand with their heart,
<dd>and turn again, and be healed.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Then I said,
&quot;Lord, how long?&quot;
<p>He answered,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Until cities are waste without inhabitant,
<dd>and houses without man,
<dd>and the land becomes utterly waste,
<dd> <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> And Yahweh has
removed men far away,
<dd>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
<dt> <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> If there is a tenth
left in it,
<dd>that also will in turn be consumed:
<dt>as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are
felled;
<dd>so the holy seed is its stock.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> It happened in the days
of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin
the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up
to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> It was told the house of David,
saying, &quot;Syria is allied with Ephraim.&quot; His heart trembled, and
the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
 <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Then Yahweh said to
Isaiah, &quot;Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at
the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's
field.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Tell him, 'Be
careful, and keep calm. Don't be afraid, neither let your heart be faint
because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of
Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the
son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> &quot;Let's go up against Judah,
and tear it apart, and let's divide it among ourselves, and set up a king
in its midst, even the son of Tabeel.&quot;  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> This is what the Lord Yahweh says:
&quot;It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.&quot;  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> For the head of Syria is Damascus,
and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim
shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people;  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> and the head of Ephraim is
Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not
believe, surely you shall not be established.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Yahweh spoke again to
Ahaz, saying,  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> &quot;Ask a
sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height
above.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> But Ahaz said, &quot;I
will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> He said, &quot;Listen
now, house of David: Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men,
that you will try the patience of my God also?  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> Therefore the Lord himself will
give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and
shall call his name <a href="#N6">Immanuel.</a>  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> He shall eat butter and honey
when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> For before the child knows to
refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor
shall be forsaken.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Yahweh
will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house, days that
have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the
king of Assyria.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> It will
happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the
uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land
of Assyria.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> They shall
come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the
rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> In that day the Lord will shave
with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the
king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also
consume the beard.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> It
shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two
sheep;  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> and it shall
happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he
shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in
the midst of the land.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> It
will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines
at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> People will go there with arrows
and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> All the hills that were
cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and
thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the
treading of sheep.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Yahweh said to me,
&quot;Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man's pen, '<a
href="#N7">For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;</a>'  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> and I will take for myself
faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of
Jeberechiah.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> I went to the
prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said Yahweh to me,
&quot;Call his name 'Maher Shalal Hash Baz.'  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> For before the child knows how to
say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus and the spoil
of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Yahweh spoke to me yet
again, saying,  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> &quot;Because this people have
refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and
Remaliah's son;  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> now
therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of
the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all
its channels, and go over all its banks.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> It will sweep onward into Judah.
It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the
stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.
 <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Make an uproar, you
peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries:
dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!
 <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Take counsel together,
and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand:
for God is with us.&quot;  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> For Yahweh spoke thus to me with
a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people,
saying,  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> &quot;Don't say,
'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this people say, 'A
conspiracy!' neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Yahweh of Armies is who you must
regard as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.
 <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> He will be a sanctuary,
but for both houses of Israel, he will be a trap and a snare for the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> Many will stumble over it, fall,
be broken, be snared, and be captured.&quot;  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Wrap up the testimony. Seal the
law among my disciples.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> I
will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I
will look for him.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Behold, I and the children whom
Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of
Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.
<p> <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> When they tell you,
&quot;Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards,
who chirp and who mutter:&quot; shouldn't a people consult with their God?
Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Turn to the law and to the
testimony! If they don't speak according to this word, surely there is no
morning for them.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> They
will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it will happen that
when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by
their God. They will turn their faces upward,  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> and look to the earth, and see
distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into
thick darkness.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> But there shall be no
more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into
contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter
time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
Galilee of the nations.
<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> The people who walked
in darkness have seen a great light.
<dd>Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light
has shined.
<dt> <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> You have multiplied
the nation.
<dd>You have increased their joy.
</dl>
<p>They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice
when they divide the spoil.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> For the yoke of his burden, and
the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in
the day of Midian.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> For all
the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in
blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> For to us a child is born. To us a
son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will
be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
Peace.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Of the increase of
his government and of peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David,
and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and
with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of
Armies will perform this.
<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> The Lord sent a word
into Jacob,
<dd>and it falls on Israel.
<dt> <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> All the people will

<dt>The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
<dd>but we will put cedars in their place.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> Therefore Yahweh will

not turned to him who struck them,

<dt> <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Therefore Yahweh will
cut off from Israel head and tail,

needy from justice, and to rob the poor among my people of their rights,
that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless

he doesn't mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his
heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> For he says, &quot;Aren't all of
my princes kings?  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Isn't
Calno like Carchemish? Isn't Hamath like Arpad? Isn't Samaria like
Damascus?&quot;  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> As my

those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> shall I not, as I have done to
Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Therefore it will happen that,
when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem,
I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria,
and the insolence of his haughty looks.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> For he has said, &quot;By the
strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have
understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have
robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their
rulers.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> My hand has
found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs
that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. There was no one who
moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Should an axe brag
against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who
saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a
staff should lift up someone who is not wood.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of
Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a
burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> The light of Israel will be for
a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his
thorns and his briers in one day.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> He will consume the glory of his
forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when
a standard bearer faints.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> The remnant of the trees of his
forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.
<p> <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> It will come to pass
in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from
the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but
shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> A remnant will return, even the
remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> For though your people, Israel,
are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A
destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
will make a full end, and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
 <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Therefore the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, says &quot;My people who dwell in Zion, don't be afraid
of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff
against you, as Egypt did.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> For yet a very little while, and
the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be
directed to his destruction.&quot;  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Yahweh of Armies will stir up a
scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.
His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against
Egypt.  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> It will happen in
that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke
from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
anointing oil.
<p> <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> He has come to Aiath.
He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> They have gone over the pass.
They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul
has fled.  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> Cry aloud with
your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!
 <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> Madmenah is a fugitive.
The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> This very day he will halt at
Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill
of Jerusalem.  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> Behold,
the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will
be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> He will cut down the thickets of
the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> 
<dl><dt>A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse,
<dd>and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.
<dt> <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh
will rest on him:
<dd>the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
<dd>the spirit of counsel and might,
<dd>the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> His delight will be
in the fear of Yahweh.
<dt>He will not judge by the sight of his eyes,
<dd>neither decide by the hearing of his ears;
<dt> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> but with
righteousness he will judge the poor,
<dd>and decide with equity for the humble of the earth.
<dt>He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
<dd>and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.
<dt> <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Righteousness will be
the belt of his waist,
<dd>and faithfulness the belt of his waist.
<dt> <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> The wolf will live
with the lamb,
<dd>and the leopard will lie down with the young goat;
<dd>The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together;

</dl>
<p> <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> It will happen in
that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a
banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> It will happen in that day that
the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant
that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from
Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the
sea.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> He will set up a
banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and
gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
 <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> The envy also of Ephraim
will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won't
envy Judah, and Judah won't persecute Ephraim.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> They will fly down on the
shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the
children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and
the children of Ammon will obey them.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> Yahweh will utterly destroy the
tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his
hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men
to march over in sandals.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> There will be a highway for the
remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel
in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> In that day you will
say, &quot;I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry
with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> Behold, God is my salvation. I
will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and
song; and he has become my salvation.&quot;  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Therefore with joy you will draw
water out of the wells of salvation.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> In that day you will say,
&quot;Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among
the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Sing to Yahweh, for he has done
excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Cry aloud and shout, you
inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great in the midst of
you!&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> The burden of Babylon,
which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Set up a banner on the bare
mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go
into the gates of the nobles.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> I have commanded my consecrated
ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly
exulting ones.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> The noise
of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an
uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh of Armies
is mustering the army for the battle.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> They come from a far country,
from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his
indignation, to destroy the whole land.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at
hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Therefore all hands will be
feeble, and everyone's heart will melt.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> They will be dismayed. Pangs and
sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They
will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame.
 <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Behold, the day of Yahweh
comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation,
and to destroy its sinners out of it.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> For the stars of the sky and its
constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its
going forth, and the moon will not cause its light to shine.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> I will punish the world for
their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance
of the proud to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
 <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> I will make people more
rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Therefore I will make the
heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the
wrath of Yahweh of Armies, and in the day of his fierce anger.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> It will happen that like a a
hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to
their own people, and will each flee to their own land.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Everyone who is found will be
thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Their infants also will be
dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and
their wives raped.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Behold, I will stir up the Medes
against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not
delight in it.  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Their
bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the
fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom
and Gomorrah.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> It will
never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to
generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will
shepherds make their flocks lie down there.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> But wild animals of the desert
will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will
dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> Wolves will cry in their
castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come,
and her days will not be prolonged.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> For Yahweh will have
compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own
land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with
the house of Jacob.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> The
peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel
will possess them in Yahweh's land for servants and for handmaids. They
will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule
over their oppressors.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> It
will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow,
from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to
serve,  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> that you will take
up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, &quot;How the
oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!&quot;  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Yahweh has broken the staff of
the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> who struck the peoples in wrath
with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a
persecution that none restrained.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> The whole earth is at rest, and
is quiet. They break out song.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> Yes, the fir trees rejoice with
you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, &quot;Since you are humbled, no
lumberjack has come up against us.&quot;  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Sheol from beneath has moved for
you to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the dead for you, even all the
rulers of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of
the nations.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> They all
will answer and ask you, &quot;Have you also become as weak as we are?
Have you become like us?&quot;  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Your pomp is brought down to
Sheol, with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out
under you, and worms cover you.
<p> <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> How you have fallen
from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the
ground, who laid the nations low!  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> You said in your heart, &quot;I
will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I
will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!&quot;  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Yet you shall be brought down to
Sheol, to the depths of the pit.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> Those who see you will stare at
you. They will ponder you, saying, &quot;Is this the man who made the
earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms;  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> who made the world like a
wilderness, and overthrew its cities; who didn't release his prisoners to
their home?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> All the kings of the
nations, sleep in glory, everyone in his own house.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> But you are cast away from your
tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust
through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead
body trodden under foot.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> You will not join them in
burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people.
The seed of evil-doers will not be named forever.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> Prepare for slaughter of his
children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up
and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities.
 <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> &quot;I will rise up
against them,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and cut off from Babylon
name and remnant, and son and son's son,&quot; says Yahweh.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> &quot;I will also make it a
possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the
broom of destruction,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> Yahweh of Armies has sworn,
saying, &quot;Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have
purposed, so shall it stand:  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> that I will break the Assyrian
in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will
leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders.  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> This is the plan that is
determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out
over all the nations.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> For Yahweh of Armies has
planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn
it back?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> This burden was in
the year that king Ahaz died.  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Don't rejoice, O Philistia, all
of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the
serpent's root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying
serpent.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> The firstborn
of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will
kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.
<p> <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Howl, gate! Cry,
city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of
the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.  <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> What will they answer the
messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the
afflicted of his people will take refuge.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> The burden of Moab:
for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing; for in a
night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> They have gone up to Bayith, and
to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over
Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> In their streets, they dress
themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone
wails, weeping abundantly.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.
Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry
aloud. Their souls tremble within them.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> My heart cries out for Moab! Her
nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent
of Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim, they raise up a cry of
destruction.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> For the
waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the
tender grass fails, there is no green thing.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> Therefore they will carry away
the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over
the brook of the willows.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> For the cry has gone around the
borders of Moab; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> For the waters of Dimon
are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of
Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Send the lambs for the
ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the
daughter of Zion.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> For it
will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the
daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> Give counsel! Execute justice!
Make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday! Hide the
outcasts! Don't betray the fugitive!  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> Let my outcasts dwell with you!
As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For
the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors
are consumed out of the land.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> A throne will be established in
loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David,
judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.
<p> <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> We have heard of the
pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride,
and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Therefore Moab will wail for
Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir
Hareseth, utterly stricken.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> For the fields of Heshbon
languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken
down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into
the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.
 <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Therefore I will weep
with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my
tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest
the battle shout has fallen.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> Gladness is taken away, and joy
out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing,
neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have
made the shouting stop.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Therefore my heart sounds like a
harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> It will happen that when Moab
presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to
his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> This is the word that Yahweh
spoke concerning Moab in time past.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> But now Yahweh has spoken,
saying, &quot;Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would
count them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his
great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> The burden of
Damascus: &quot;Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it
will be a ruinous heap.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> The cities of Aroer are forsaken.
They will be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them
afraid.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> The fortress
shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant
of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,&quot; says
Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> &quot;It will happen in that day
that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh
will become lean.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> It will
be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain.
Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim.
 <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> Yet gleanings will be
left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the
top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a
fruitful tree,&quot; says Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> In that day, people will look to
their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
 <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> They will not look to the
altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which
their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the incense altars.
 <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> In that day, their strong
cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain
top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will
be a desolation.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> For you
have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock
of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign
seedlings.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> In the day of
your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed
blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate
sorrow.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> Ah, the uproar
of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of
nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> The nations will rush like the
rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far
off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
and like the whirling dust before the storm.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> At evening, behold, terror!
Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who
plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> Ah, the land of the
rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> that sends ambassadors by the
sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, saying, &quot;Go, you swift
messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their
beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land
the rivers divide!&quot;  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> All you inhabitants of the world,
and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the
mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> For Yahweh said to me, &quot;I
will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in
sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.&quot;  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> For before the harvest, when the
blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the
spreading branches.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> They
will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the
animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the
animals of the earth will winter on them.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> In that time, a present will be
brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people tall and smooth, even from a
people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and
treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of
Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> The burden of Egypt:
&quot;Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols
of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt in
its midst.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> I will stir up
the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against
his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and
kingdom against kingdom.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> The spirit of Egypt will fail in
its midst. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the
charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> I will give over the Egyptians
into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,&quot;
says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> The waters will fail from the
sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> The rivers will become foul. The
streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will
wither away.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> The meadows
by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the
Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> The fishermen will lament, and
all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on
the waters will languish.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> Moreover those who work in combed
flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> The pillars will be broken in
pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> The princes of Zoan are utterly
foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become
stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, &quot;I am the son of the wise, the son
of ancient kings?&quot;  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> Where then are your wise men?
Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has
purposed concerning Egypt.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> The princes of Zoan have become
fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go
astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> Yahweh has mixed a spirit of
perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray
in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> Neither shall there be for Egypt
any work, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> In that day the Egyptians will
be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the
hand of Yahweh of Armies, which he shakes over them.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> The land of Judah will become a
terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid,
because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.
 <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> In that day, there will
be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and
swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called &quot;The city of
destruction.&quot;  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> In
that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of
Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> It will be for a sign and for a
witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to
Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a
defender, and he will deliver them.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> Yahweh will be known to Egypt,
and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship
with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will
perform it.  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Yahweh will
strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he
will be entreated by them, and will heal them.  <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> In that day there will be a
highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt,
and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the
Assyrians.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> In that day,
Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the
midst of the earth;  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> because Yahweh of Armies has
blessed them, saying, &quot;Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work
of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> In the year that
Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he
fought against Ashdod and took it;  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> at that time Yahweh spoke by
Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, &quot;Go, and loosen the sackcloth from
off your waist, and take your shoes from off your feet.&quot; He did so,
walking naked and barefoot.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;As my servant
Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder
concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> so the king of Assyria will lead
away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old,
naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
 <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> They will be dismayed and
confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their
glory.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> The inhabitants of
this coast land will say in that day, 'Behold, this is our expectation,
where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we,
how will we escape?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> The burden of the
wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes
from the wilderness, from an awesome land.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> A grievous vision is declared to
me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys.
Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media's sighing.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Therefore my thighs are filled
with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in
labor. I am in so much pain that I can't hear. I so am dismayed that I
can't see.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> My heart
flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been
turned into trembling for me.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> They prepare the table. They set
the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
 <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> For the Lord said to me,
&quot;Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> When he sees a troop, horsemen in
pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently
with great attentiveness.&quot;  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> He cried like a lion: &quot;Lord,
I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I
stay at my post.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Behold,
here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.&quot; He answered,
&quot;Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods
are broken to the ground.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> You are my threshing, and the
grain of my floor!&quot; That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel, I have declared to you.
<p> <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> The burden of Dumah.
One calls to me out of Seir, &quot;Watchman, what of the night? Watchman,
what of the night?&quot;  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> The watchman said, &quot;The
morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back
again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> The burden on Arabia.
In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> They brought water to him who
was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with
their bread.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> For they
fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and
from the heat of battle.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> For the Lord said to me,
&quot;Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the
glory of Kedar will fail,  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> and the residue of the number of
the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for
Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> The burden of the
valley of vision. What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the
housetops?  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> You that are
full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not
slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> All your rulers fled away
together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were
bound together. They fled far away.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> Therefore I said, &quot;Look away
from me. I will weep bitterly. Don't labor to comfort me for the
destruction of the daughter of my people.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> For it is a day of confusion, and
of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in
the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the
mountains.&quot;  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> Elam
carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered
the shield.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> It happened
that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set
themselves in array at the gate.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> He took away the covering of
Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.
 <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> You saw the breaches of
the city of David, that they were many; and you gathered together the
waters of the lower pool.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> You numbered the houses of
Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> You also made a reservoir
between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn't look
to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who
purposed it long ago.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> In
that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, and to mourning,
and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> and behold, joy and gladness,
killing cattle and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine:
&quot;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.&quot;  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> Yahweh of Armies revealed
himself in my ears, &quot;Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you
until you die,&quot; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
<p> <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> Thus says the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, &quot;Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to
Shebna, who is over the house, and say,  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> 'What are you doing here? Who
has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?' Cutting himself out a
tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!&quot;
 <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> Behold, Yahweh will
overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.
 <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> He will surely wind you
around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There
you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of
your lord's house.  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> I
will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your
station.
<p> <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> It will happen in
that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> and I will clothe him with your
robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government
into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and to the house of Judah.  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> I will lay the key of the house
of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will
shut, and no one will open.  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> I will fasten him like a nail in
a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
 <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> They will hang on him
all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every
small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> &quot;In that day,&quot; says
Yahweh of Armies, &quot;the nail that was fastened in a sure place will
give way. It will be cut down, and fall. The burden that was on it will be
cut off, for Yahweh has spoken it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> The burden of Tyre.
Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no
house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
 <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> Be still, you inhabitants
of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea,
have replenished.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> On
great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her
revenue. She was the market of nations.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea
has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, &quot;I have not travailed,
nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up
virgins.&quot;  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> When the
report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
 <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> Pass over to Tarshish!
Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> Is this your joyous city, whose
antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?
 <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> Who has planned this
against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose
traffickers are the honorable of the earth?  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> Yahweh of Armies has planned it,
to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable
of the earth.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> Pass
through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no
restraint any more.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> He
has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms.
Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan's strongholds.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> He said, &quot;You shall rejoice
no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to
Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> Behold, the land of
the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who
dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its
palaces. They made it a ruin.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for
your stronghold is laid waste!  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> It will come to pass in that day
that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one
king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song
of the prostitute.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> Take
a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make
sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> It will happen after the end of
seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her
wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on
the surface of the earth.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> Her merchandise and her wages
will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her
merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat
sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Behold, Yahweh makes
the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its
inhabitants.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> It will be
as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his
master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with
the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of
interest, so with the giver of interest.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> The earth will be utterly emptied
and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> The earth mourns and fades away.
The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth
languish.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> The earth also
is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the
laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> Therefore the curse has devoured
the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the
inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> The new wine mourns. The vine
languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> The mirth of tambourines ceases.
The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> They will not drink wine with a
song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> The confused city is broken
down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> There is a crying in the streets
because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.
 <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> The city is left in
desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> For it will be so in the midst
of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the
gleanings when the vintage is done.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> These shall lift up their voice.
They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.
 <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> Therefore glorify Yahweh
in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of
the sea!  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> From the
uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!
But I said, &quot;I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!&quot; The
treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very
treacherously.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> Fear, the
pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> It will happen that he who flees
from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out
of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on
high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> The earth is utterly broken. The
earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> The earth will stagger like a
drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience
will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> It shall happen in that day that
Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the
earth on the earth.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> They
shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and
shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.
 <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> Then the moon shall be
confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount
Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Yahweh, you are my
God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done
wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and
truth.  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> For you have made
a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to
be no city. It will never be built.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Therefore a strong people will
glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> For you have been a stronghold to
the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the
storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a
storm against the wall.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> As the heat in a dry place will
you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a
cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> In this mountain, Yahweh of
Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of choice
wines, of fat things full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> He will destroy in this mountain
the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is
spread over all nations.  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> He has swallowed up death
forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will
take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh
has spoken it.  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> It shall
be said in that day, &quot;Behold, this is our God! We have waited for
him, and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will
be glad and rejoice in his salvation!&quot;  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> For in this mountain the hand of
Yahweh will rest.
<p>Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down
in the water of the dunghill.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> He will spread out his hands in
its midst, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride
will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> He has brought the high fortress
of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> In that day, this song
will be sung in the land of Judah:
<p>
<dl><dt>&quot;We have a strong city.
<dd>God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
<dt> <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> Open the gates, that
the righteous nation may enter:
<dd>the one which keeps faith.
<dt> <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> You will keep
whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
<dd>because he trusts in you.
<dt> <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> Trust in Yahweh
forever;
<dd>for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
<dt> <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> For he has brought
down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
<dd>He lays it low.
<dd>He lays it low even to the ground.
<dd>He brings it even to the dust.
<dt> <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> The foot shall tread
it down;
<dd>Even the feet of the poor,
<dd>and the steps of the needy.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> The way of the just
is uprightness.
<dd>You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.
<dt> <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> 
</dl>Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> With my soul have I desired you
in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for
when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn
righteousness.  <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> Let favor
be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land
of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh's majesty.
 <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Yahweh, your hand is
lifted up, yet they don't see; but they will see your zeal for the people,
and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> Yahweh, you will ordain peace
for us, for you have also worked all our works for us.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> Yahweh our God, other lords
besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make
mention of your name.  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> The dead shall not live. The
deceased shall not rise. Therefore have you visited and destroyed them,
and caused all memory of them to perish.  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> You have increased the nation, O
Yahweh. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have
enlarged all the borders of the land.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> Yahweh, in trouble they have
visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
 <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> Like as a woman with
child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out
in her pangs; so we have been before you, Yahweh.  <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> We have been with child. We have
been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked
any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
fallen.  <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> Your dead shall
live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the
dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth
the dead.
<p> <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> Come, my people,
enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself
for a little moment, until the indignation is past.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> For, behold, Yahweh comes forth
out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
iniquity. The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover
her slain.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> In that day, Yahweh
with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the
fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the
dragon that is in the sea.  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> In that day, sing to her, &quot;A
pleasant vineyard!  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> I,
Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage
it, I will keep it night and day.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> Wrath is not in me, but if I
should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them
and I would burn them together.  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> Or else let him take hold of my
strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> In days to come, Jacob
will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of
the world with fruit.  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> Has
he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like
those who killed them were killed?  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> In measure, when you send them
away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in
the day of the east wind.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> Therefore, by this the iniquity
of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his
sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are
beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense altars shall rise no
more.  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> For the fortified
city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness.
The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its
branches.  <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> When its
boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set
them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who
made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will
show them no favor.  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> It
will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream
of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by
one, children of Israel.  <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> It will happen in that day that
a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the
land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall
come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> Woe to the crown of
pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his
glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who
are overcome with wine!  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Behold, the Lord has a mighty and
strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of
mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his
hand.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> The crown of pride
of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> The fading flower of his glorious
beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the
first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as
he sees it.  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> In that day,
Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to
the residue of his people;  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> and a spirit of justice to him
who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at
the gate.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> They also reel
with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel
with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong
drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> For all tables are completely
full of filthy vomit and filthiness.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> Whom will he teach knowledge? To
whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and
drawn from the breasts?  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> For it is precept on precept,
precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a
little.  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> But he will
speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language;  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> to whom he said, &quot;This is
the resting place. Give rest to weary;&quot; and &quot;This is the
refreshing;&quot; yet they would not hear.  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> Therefore the word of Yahweh
will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line
on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward,
be broken, be snared, and be taken.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> Therefore hear the word of
Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem:  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> &quot;Because you have said, 'We
have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we in agreement. When
the overflowing scourge passes through, it won't come to us; for we have
made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.'&quot;
 <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> Therefore thus says the
Lord Yahweh, &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried
stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall
not act hastily.  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> I will
make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The
hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the
hiding place.  <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> Your
covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall
not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be
trampled down by it.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> As
often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it
will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror
to understand the message.&quot;  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> For the bed is too short to
stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> For Yahweh will rise up as on
Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do
his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary
act.  <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> Now therefore don't
be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of
destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.
<p> <a name="C28V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:23</font></a> Give ear, and hear my
voice! Listen, and hear my speech!  <a name="C28V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:24</font></a> Does he who plows to sow plow
continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?  <a name="C28V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:25</font></a> When he has leveled its surface,
doesn't he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the
wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its
place?  <a name="C28V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:26</font></a> For his God
instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.  <a name="C28V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:27</font></a> For the dill are not threshed
with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin;
but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.  <a name="C28V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:28</font></a> Bread flour must be ground; so
he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his
threshing cart over it, his horses don't grind it.  <a name="C28V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:29</font></a> This also comes forth from
Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> Woe to Ariel! Ariel,
the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come
around;  <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> then I will
distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be
to me as an <a href="#N8">altar hearth</a>.  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> I will encamp against you all
around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will
raise siege works against you.  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> You will be brought down, and
will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust.
Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
and your speech will whisper out of the dust.  <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> But the multitude of your foes
will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff
that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.  <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> She will be visited by Yahweh of
Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and
storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.  <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> The multitude of all the nations
that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her
stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the
night.  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> It will be like
when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his
hunger isn't satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he
drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty.
The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be
like that.  <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> Pause and
wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with
wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.  <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> For Yahweh has poured out on you
a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has
covered your heads, the seers.  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> All vision has become to you
like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is
educated, saying, &quot;Read this, please;&quot; and he says, &quot;I
can't, for it is sealed:&quot;  <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> and the book is delivered to one
who is not educated, saying, &quot;Read this, please;&quot; and he says,
&quot;I can't read.&quot;  <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> The Lord said, &quot;Because
this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me,
but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a
commandment of men which has been taught;  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> therefore, behold, I will
proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work
and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the
understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> Woe to those who
deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark,
and who say, &quot;Who sees us?&quot; and &quot;Who knows us?&quot;
 <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> You turn things upside
down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made
should say about him who made it, &quot;He didn't make me;&quot; or the
thing formed say of him who formed it, &quot;He has no understanding?&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> Isn't it yet a very
little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the
fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> In that day, the deaf will hear
the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity
and out of darkness.  <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> The
humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> For the ruthless is brought to
nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil
are cut off-- <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> who cause a
person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the
gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.
 <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> Therefore thus says
Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: &quot;Jacob
shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale.  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> But when he sees his children,
the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name.
Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of
the God of Israel.  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> They
also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble
will receive instruction.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> &quot;Woe to the
rebellious children,&quot; says Yahweh, &quot;who take counsel, but not
from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may
add sin to sin,  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> who set
out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice; to strengthen
themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of
Egypt!  <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> Therefore the
strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of
Egypt your confusion.  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> For
their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.
 <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> They shall all be ashamed
because of a people that can't profit them, that are not a help nor
profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> The burden of the
animals of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the
lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their
riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps
of camels, to an unprofitable people.  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> For Egypt helps in vain, and to
no purpose; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> Now go, write it before them on a
tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come
forever and ever.  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> For it
is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the law
of Yahweh;  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> who tell the
seers, &quot;Don't see!&quot; and to the prophets, &quot;Don't prophesy to
us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits.  <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> Get out of the way. Turn aside
from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.&quot;
 <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> Therefore thus says the
Holy One of Israel, &quot;Because you despise this word, and trust in
oppression and perverseness, and rely on it;  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> therefore this iniquity shall be
to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose
breaking comes suddenly in an instant.  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> He will break it as a potter's
vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there
won't be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire
from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.&quot;  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> For thus said the Lord Yahweh,
the Holy One of Israel, &quot;You will be saved in returning and rest.
Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.&quot; You refused,
 <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> but you said, &quot;No,
for we will flee on horses;&quot; therefore you will flee; and, &quot;We
will ride on the swift;&quot; therefore those who pursue you will be
swift.  <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> One thousand will
flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you
are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a
hill.  <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> Therefore Yahweh
will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be
exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice.
Blessed are all those who wait for him.  <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> For the people will dwell in
Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to
you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you.
 <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> Though the Lord may give
you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers
won't be hidden anymore, but your eyes will see your teachers;  <a name="C30V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:21</font></a> and when you turn to the right
hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind
you, saying, &quot;This is the way. Walk in it.&quot;  <a name="C30V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:22</font></a> You shall defile the overlaying
of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images
of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it,
&quot;Go away!&quot;  <a name="C30V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:23</font></a> He
will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and
bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that
day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.  <a name="C30V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:24</font></a> The oxen likewise and the young
donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender, which has been
winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.  <a name="C30V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:25</font></a> There shall be brooks and
streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day
of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.  <a name="C30V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:26</font></a> Moreover the light of the moon
will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven
times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds
up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.
<p> <a name="C30V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:27</font></a> Behold, the name of
Yahweh comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising
smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring
fire.  <a name="C30V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:28</font></a> His breath is as
an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations
with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in
the jaws of the peoples.  <a name="C30V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:29</font></a> You will have a song, as in the
night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes
with a flute to come to Yahweh's mountain, to Israel's Rock.  <a name="C30V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:30</font></a> Yahweh will cause his glorious
voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the
indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,
storm, and hailstones.  <a name="C30V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:31</font></a> For through the voice of Yahweh
the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod.  <a name="C30V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:32</font></a> Every stroke of the rod of
punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with the sound of
tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing
weapons.  <a name="C30V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:33</font></a> For his burning
place has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is made ready. He has made
its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh's breath, like a
stream of sulfur, kindles it.

<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> Now it happened in the
fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria
attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah, and captured them.  <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> The king of Assyria sent
Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He
stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.
 <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> Then Eliakim the son of
Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the
son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> Rabshakeh said to them, &quot;Now
tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, &quot;What
confidence is this in which you trust?  <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> I say that your counsel and
strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that
you have rebelled against me?  <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> Behold, you trust in the staff of
this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go
into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust
in him.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> But if you tell
me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' isn't that he whose high places and
whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to
Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar?'&quot;  <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> Now therefore, please make a
pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand
horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.  <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> How then can you turn away the
face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your
trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> Have I come up now without
Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, &quot;Go up
against this land, and destroy it.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> Then Eliakim, Shebna
and Joah said to Rabshakeh, &quot;Please speak to your servants in
Aramaic, for we understand it; and don't speak to us in the Jews' language
in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> But Rabshakeh said,
&quot;Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these
words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung
and drink their own urine with you?&quot;  <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> Then Rabshakeh stood, and called
out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, &quot;Hear the
words of the great king, the king of Assyria!  <a name="C36V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:14</font></a> Thus says the king, 'Don't let
Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.  <a name="C36V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:15</font></a> Don't let Hezekiah make you
trust in Yahweh, saying, &quot;Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city
won't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&quot;'  <a name="C36V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:16</font></a> Don't listen to Hezekiah, for
thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to
me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and
each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;  <a name="C36V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:17</font></a> until I come and take you away
to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of
bread and vineyards.  <a name="C36V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:18</font></a> Beware lest Hezekiah persuade
you, saying, &quot;Yahweh will deliver us.&quot; Have any of the gods of
the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?
 <a name="C36V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:19</font></a> Where are the gods of
Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered
Samaria from my hand?  <a name="C36V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:20</font></a> Who are they among all the gods
of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that
Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:21</font></a> But they remained
silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king's commandment was,
&quot;Don't answer him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C36V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:22</font></a> Then Eliakim the son
of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah,
the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,
and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
<p> <a name="C37V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:1</font></a> It happened, when king
Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with
sackcloth, and went into Yahweh's house.  <a name="C37V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:2</font></a> He sent Eliakim, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered
with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.  <a name="C37V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:3</font></a> They said to him, &quot;Thus says
Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection;
for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring
forth.  <a name="C37V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:4</font></a> It may be Yahweh
your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his
master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which
Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant
that is left.'&quot;  <a name="C37V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:5</font></a> So
the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<p> <a name="C37V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:6</font></a> Isaiah said to them,
&quot;Tell your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, &quot;Don't be afraid of the
words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
have blasphemed me.  <a name="C37V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:7</font></a> Behold, I will put a spirit in
him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause
him to fall by the sword in his own land.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:8</font></a> So Rabshakeh returned,
and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard
that he was departed from Lachish.  <a name="C37V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:9</font></a> He heard news concerning Tirhakah
king of Ethiopia, &quot;He has come out to fight against you.&quot; When
he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,  <a name="C37V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:10</font></a> &quot;Thus you shall speak to
Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Don't let your God in whom you trust
deceive you, saying, &quot;Jerusalem won't be given into the hand of the
king of Assyria.&quot;  <a name="C37V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:11</font></a> Behold, you have heard what the
kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall
you be delivered?  <a name="C37V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:12</font></a> Have
the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed,
Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
 <a name="C37V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:13</font></a> Where is the king of
Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of
Hena, and Ivvah?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:14</font></a> Hezekiah received the
letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up
to Yahweh's house, and spread it before Yahweh.  <a name="C37V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:15</font></a> Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh,
saying,  <a name="C37V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:16</font></a> &quot;Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are
the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made
heaven and earth.  <a name="C37V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:17</font></a> Turn
your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear all
of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.  <a name="C37V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:18</font></a> Truly, Yahweh, the kings of
Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land,  <a name="C37V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:19</font></a> and have cast their gods into
the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and
stone; therefore they have destroyed them.  <a name="C37V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:20</font></a> Now therefore, Yahweh our God,
save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that
you are Yahweh, even you only.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:21</font></a> Then Isaiah the son
of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, &quot;Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, 'Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of
Assyria,  <a name="C37V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:22</font></a> this is the
word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him. The virgin daughter of Zion
has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken
her head at you.  <a name="C37V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:23</font></a> Whom
have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice
and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.  <a name="C37V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:24</font></a> By your servants, have you
defied the Lord, and have said, &quot;With the multitude of my chariots I
have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of
Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees. I will
enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.  <a name="C37V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:25</font></a> I have dug and drunk water, and
with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.&quot;
 <a name="C37V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:26</font></a> Have you not heard how I
have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought
it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning
them into ruinous heaps.  <a name="C37V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:27</font></a> Therefore their inhabitants had
little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass
of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
and like a field before its crop has grown.  <a name="C37V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:28</font></a> But I know your sitting down,
your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me.  <a name="C37V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:29</font></a> Because of your raging against
me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I
put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you
back by the way by which you came.  <a name="C37V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:30</font></a> This shall be the sign to you.
You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year
that which springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap and
plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.  <a name="C37V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:31</font></a> The remnant that is escaped of
the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
 <a name="C37V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:32</font></a> For out of Jerusalem a
remnant will go forth, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal
of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.'  <a name="C37V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:33</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh
concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will not come to this city, nor shoot
an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a
mound against it.  <a name="C37V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:34</font></a> By the
way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to
this city,' says Yahweh.  <a name="C37V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:35</font></a> 'For I will defend this city to
save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:36</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp
of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were
all dead bodies.  <a name="C37V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:37</font></a> So
Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and
stayed there.  <a name="C37V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:38</font></a> It
happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that
Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they
escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C38V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:1</font></a> In those days was
Hezekiah sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to
him, and said to him, &quot;Thus says Yahweh, 'Set your house in order,
for you will die, and not live.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:2</font></a> Then Hezekiah turned
his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,  <a name="C38V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:3</font></a> and said, &quot;Remember now,
Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a
perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.&quot;
Hezekiah wept bitterly.
<p> <a name="C38V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:4</font></a> Then the word of
Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,  <a name="C38V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:5</font></a> &quot;Go, and tell Hezekiah,
'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, &quot;I have heard your
prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your
life.  <a name="C38V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:6</font></a> I will deliver you
and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend
this city.  <a name="C38V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:7</font></a> This shall be
the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has
spoken.  <a name="C38V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:8</font></a> Behold, I will
cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of
Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten
steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:9</font></a> The writing of
Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his
sickness.
<p> <a name="C38V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:10</font></a>

</dl>
<p> <a name="C38V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:21</font></a> Now Isaiah had said,
&quot;Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil,
and he shall recover.&quot;  <a name="C38V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:22</font></a> Hezekiah also had said,
&quot;What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh?&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:1</font></a> At that time, Merodach
Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to
Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.  <a name="C39V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:2</font></a> Hezekiah was pleased with them,
and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the
gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor,
and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house,
nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn't show them.  <a name="C39V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:3</font></a> Then Isaiah the prophet came to
king Hezekiah, and asked him, &quot;What did these men say? Where did they
come from to you?&quot;
<p>Hezekiah said, &quot;They have come from a country far from me, even
from Babylon.&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:4</font></a> Then he asked,
&quot;What have they seen in your house?&quot;
<p>Hezekiah answered, &quot;They have seen all that is in my house. There
is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:5</font></a> Then said Isaiah to
Hezekiah, &quot;Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:  <a name="C39V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:6</font></a> 'Behold, the days are coming when
all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up
until this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says
Yahweh.  <a name="C39V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:7</font></a> 'They will take
away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they
will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon's palace.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:8</font></a> Then Hezekiah said to
Isaiah, &quot;Yahweh's word which you have spoken is good.&quot; He said
moreover, &quot;For there will be peace and truth in my days.&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:1</font></a> &quot;Comfort, comfort

<dt>I have not burdened you with offerings,
<dd>nor wearied you with frankincense.
<dt> <a name="C43V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:24</font></a> You have bought me
no sweet cane with money,
<dd>nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices;

<dd>You have wearied me with your iniquities.
<dt> <a name="C43V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:25</font></a> I, even I, am he who
blots out your transgressions for my own sake;

<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C44V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:1</font></a> Yet listen now, Jacob
my servant,
<dd>and Israel, whom I have chosen.
<dt> <a name="C44V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:2</font></a> This is what Yahweh
who made you,
<dd>and formed you from the womb,
<dd>who will help you says:
<dt>&quot;Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant;
<dd>and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
<dt> <a name="C44V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:3</font></a> For I will pour water
on him who is thirsty,

<dt>I will pour my Spirit on your seed,
<dd>and my blessing on your offspring:
<dt> <a name="C44V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:4</font></a> and they will spring
up among the grass,
<dd>as willows by the watercourses.
<dt> <a name="C44V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:5</font></a> One will say, 'I am
Yahweh's;'
<dd>and another will be called by the name of Jacob;

<dd>and honor the name of Israel.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C44V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:6</font></a> This is what Yahweh,
the King of Israel,

<dt>&quot;I am the first, and I am the last;
<dd>and besides me there is no God.
<dt> <a name="C44V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:7</font></a> Who is like me?
<dd>Who will call,
<dd>and will declare it,
<dd>and set it in order for me,
<dd>since I established the ancient people?
<dt>Let them declare the things that are coming,
<dd>and that will happen.
<dt> <a name="C44V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:8</font></a> Don't fear,

<dt>Haven't I declared it to you long ago,
<dd>and shown it?
<dt>You are my witnesses.
<dd>Is there a God besides me?
<dt>Indeed, there is not.
<dd>I don't know any other Rock.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C44V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:9</font></a> Everyone who makes an
engraved image is vain.

<dd>Their own witnesses don't see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.
<dt> <a name="C44V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:10</font></a> Who has fashioned a
god,
<dd>or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?
<dt> <a name="C44V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:11</font></a> Behold, all his
fellows will be disappointed;

<dt>Let them all be gathered together.
<dd>Let them stand up.

<dd>They will be put to shame together.
<dt> <a name="C44V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:12</font></a> The blacksmith takes
an axe,

<dt> <a name="C44V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:13</font></a> The carpenter
stretches out a line.
<dd>He marks it out with a pencil.
<dd>He shapes it with planes.
<dd>He marks it out with compasses,

<dd>with the beauty of a man,
<dd>to reside in a house.
<dt> <a name="C44V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:14</font></a> He cuts down cedars
for himself,

<dt>He plants a fir tree,
<dd>and the rain nourishes it.
<dt> <a name="C44V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:15</font></a> Then it will be for
a man to burn;
<dd>and he takes some of it, and warms himself.
<dd>Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.
<dt>Yes, he makes a god, and worships it;
<dd>he makes it an engraved image, and falls down to it.
<dt> <a name="C44V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:16</font></a> He burns part of it
in the fire.
<dd>With part of it, he eats meat.
<dd>He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.
<dt>Yes, he warms himself,
<dd>and says, &quot;Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C44V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:17</font></a> The rest of it he
makes into a god,
<dd>even his engraved image.
<dt>He bows down to it and worships,
<dd>and prays to it, and says, &quot;Deliver me; for you are my god!&quot;
<dt> <a name="C44V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:18</font></a> They don't know,
neither do they consider:

<dd>Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.
<dd>I have roasted meat and eaten it.
<dd>Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
<dd>Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?&quot;
<dt> <a name="C44V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:20</font></a> He feeds on ashes.
<dd>A deceived heart has turned him aside;

<dt> <a name="C44V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:21</font></a> Remember these
things, Jacob and Israel;
<dd>for you are my servant.
<dd>I have formed you.
<dd>You are my servant.
<dd>Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
<dt> <a name="C44V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:22</font></a> I have blotted out,
as a thick cloud, your transgressions,

<dd>Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C44V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:23</font></a> Sing, you heavens,
for Yahweh has done it!
<dd>Shout, you lower parts of the earth!
<dd>Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,
<dd>for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,
<dd>and will glorify himself in Israel.
<dt> <a name="C44V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:24</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
your Redeemer,
<dd>and he who formed you from the womb:
<dt>&quot;I am Yahweh, who makes all things;
<dd>who alone stretches out the heavens;
<dd>who spreads out the earth by myself;
<dt> <a name="C44V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:25</font></a> who frustrates the
signs of the liars,
<dd>and makes diviners mad;
<dt>who turns wise men backward,
<dd>and makes their knowledge foolish;
<dt> <a name="C44V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:26</font></a> who confirms the
word of his servant,
<dd>and performs the counsel of his messengers;
<dt>who says of Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited;'
<dd>and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,'
<dd>and I will raise up its waste places;'
<dt> <a name="C44V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:27</font></a> who says to the
deep, 'Be dry,'
<dd>and 'I will dry up your rivers;'
<dt> <a name="C44V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:28</font></a> Who says of Cyrus,
'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,'
<dd>even saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built;'
<dd>and of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'&quot;
<dt>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C45V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh to
his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations
before him, and strip kings of their armor; to open the doors before him,
and the gates shall not be shut:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C45V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:2</font></a> &quot;I will go
before you,
<dd>and make the rough places smooth.
<dt>I will break the doors of brass in pieces,
<dd>and cut apart the bars of iron.
<dt> <a name="C45V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:3</font></a> I will give you the
treasures of darkness,
<dd>and hidden riches of secret places,
<dt>that you may know that it is I, Yahweh, who call you by your name,
<dd>even the God of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C45V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:4</font></a> For Jacob my
servant's sake,
<dd>and Israel my chosen,
<dt>I have called you by your name.
<dd>I have surnamed you,
<dd>though you have not known me.
<dt> <a name="C45V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:5</font></a> I am Yahweh, and
there is none else.
<dd>Besides me, there is no God.
<dt>I will <a href="#N10">strengthen</a> you,
<dd>though you have not known me;
<dt> <a name="C45V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:6</font></a> that they may know
from the rising of the sun,
<dd>and from the west,
<dt>that there is none besides me.
<dd>I am Yahweh, and there is no one else.
<dt> <a name="C45V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:7</font></a> I form the light,
<dd>and create darkness.
<dt>I make peace,
<dd>and create calamity.
<dt>I am Yahweh,
<dd>who does all these things.
<dt> <a name="C45V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:8</font></a> Distil, you heavens,
from above,
<dd>and let the skies pour down righteousness.
<dt>Let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation,
<dd>and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it.
<dt>I, Yahweh, have created it.
<dt> <a name="C45V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:9</font></a> Woe to him who
strives with his Maker--
<dd>a clay pot among the clay pots of the earth!
<dt>Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, 'What are you making?'
<dd>or your work, 'He has no hands?'
<dt> <a name="C45V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:10</font></a> Woe to him who says
to a father, 'What have you become the father of?'
<dd>or to a mother, 'To what have you given birth?'&quot;
<dt> <a name="C45V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:11</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
the Holy One of Israel,
<dd>and his Maker:
<dt>&quot;You ask me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,
<dd>and you command me concerning the work of my hands!
<dt> <a name="C45V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:12</font></a> I have made the
earth, and created man on it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the
heavens; and all their army have I commanded.  <a name="C45V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:13</font></a> I have raised him up in
righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my
city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, says
Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C45V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:14</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh: &quot;The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia,
and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be
yours. They shall go after you. In chains they shall come over; and they
shall fall down to you. They shall make supplication to you: 'Surely God
is in you; and there is none else, there is no other god.  <a name="C45V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:15</font></a> Most certainly you are a God who
hid yourself, God of Israel, the Savior.'&quot;
<dt> <a name="C45V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:16</font></a> They shall be
disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them; they shall go into confusion
together who are makers of idols.  <a name="C45V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:17</font></a> <I>But</I> Israel shall be saved
by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation: you shall not be disappointed nor
confounded world without end.  <a name="C45V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:18</font></a> For thus says Yahweh who created
the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it
and didn't create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: I am Yahweh;
and there is no one else.  <a name="C45V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:19</font></a> I have not spoken in secret, in
a place of the land of darkness; I didn't say to the seed of Jacob, Seek
you me in vain: I, Yahweh, speak righteousness, I declare things that are
right.  <a name="C45V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:20</font></a> Assemble
yourselves and come; draw near together, you who have escaped from the
nations: they have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved
image, and pray to a god that can't save.  <a name="C45V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:21</font></a> Declare you, and bring <I>it</I>
forth; yes, let them take counsel together: who has shown this from
ancient time? who has declared it of old? Haven't I, Yahweh? and there is
no God else besides me, a just God and a Savior; there is no one besides
me.  <a name="C45V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:22</font></a> Look to me, and be
you saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none
else.  <a name="C45V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:23</font></a> By myself have I
sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth <I>in</I> righteousness, and
shall not return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall
swear.  <a name="C45V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:24</font></a> Only in Yahweh,
it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men
come; and all those who were incensed against him shall be disappointed.
 <a name="C45V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:25</font></a> In Yahweh shall all the
seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
<dt> <a name="C46V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:1</font></a> Bel bows down, Nebo
stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things
that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary
<I>animal</I>.  <a name="C46V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:2</font></a> They
stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but
themselves are gone into captivity.  <a name="C46V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:3</font></a> Listen to me, house of Jacob, and
all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne <I>by me</I>
from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;  <a name="C46V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:4</font></a> and even to old age I am he, and
even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I
will carry, and will deliver.  <a name="C46V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:5</font></a> To whom will you liken me, and
make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?  <a name="C46V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:6</font></a> Some pour out gold from the bag,
and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a
god. They fall down--yes, they worship.  <a name="C46V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:7</font></a> They bear it on the shoulder,
they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it
shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save
him out of his trouble.  <a name="C46V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:8</font></a> Remember this, and show
yourselves men; bring it again to mind, you transgressors.  <a name="C46V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:9</font></a> Remember the former things of
old: for I am God, and there is none else; <I>I am</I> God, and there is
none like me;  <a name="C46V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:10</font></a> declaring
the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not
<I>yet</I> done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my
pleasure;  <a name="C46V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:11</font></a> calling a
ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country;
yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will
also do it.  <a name="C46V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:12</font></a> Listen to
me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:  <a name="C46V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:13</font></a> I bring near my righteousness,
it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place
salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C47V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:1</font></a> Come down, and sit in
the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne,
daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and
delicate.  <a name="C47V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:2</font></a> Take the
millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover
the leg, pass through the rivers.  <a name="C47V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:3</font></a> Your nakedness shall be
uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will
spare no man.  <a name="C47V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:4</font></a> Our
Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.  <a name="C47V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:5</font></a> Sit you silent, and get you into
darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called The
mistress of kingdoms.  <a name="C47V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:6</font></a> I
was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into
your hand: you did show them no mercy; on the aged have you very heavily
laid your yoke.  <a name="C47V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:7</font></a> You said,
I shall be mistress forever; so that you did not lay these things to your
heart, neither did remember the latter end of it.  <a name="C47V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:8</font></a> Now therefore hear this, you who
are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, I am, and
there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I
know the loss of children:  <a name="C47V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:9</font></a> but these two things shall come
to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in
their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your
sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.  <a name="C47V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:10</font></a> For you have trusted in your
wickedness; you have said, None sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge,
it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is
none else besides me.  <a name="C47V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:11</font></a> Therefore evil will come on you;
you won't know when it dawns: and mischief wil fall on you; you will not
be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which
you don't know.  <a name="C47V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:12</font></a> Stand
now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in
which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to
profit, if so be you may prevail.  <a name="C47V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:13</font></a> You are wearied in the multitude
of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly
prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on
you.  <a name="C47V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:14</font></a> Behold, they shall
be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves
from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire
to sit before.  <a name="C47V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:15</font></a> Thus
shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have
trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter;
there shall be none to save you.
<dt> <a name="C48V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:1</font></a> Hear you this, house
of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of
the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Yahweh, and make mention of
the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness  <a name="C48V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:2</font></a> (for they call themselves of the
holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; Yahweh of Armies is
his name):  <a name="C48V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:3</font></a> I have
declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of my
mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened.  <a name="C48V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:4</font></a> Because I knew that you are
obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;  <a name="C48V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:5</font></a> therefore I have declared it to
you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it to you; lest you
should say, My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten
image, has commanded them.  <a name="C48V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:6</font></a> You have heard it; see all this;
and you, will you not declare it? I have shown you new things from this
time, even hidden things, which you have not known.  <a name="C48V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:7</font></a> They are created now, and not
from of old; and before this day you didn't hear them; lest you should
say, Behold, I knew them.  <a name="C48V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:8</font></a> Yes, you didn't hear; yes, you
didn't know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you
did deal very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.
 <a name="C48V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:9</font></a> For my name's sake will I
defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut
you off.  <a name="C48V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:10</font></a> Behold, I have
refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of
affliction.  <a name="C48V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:11</font></a> For my own
sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should <I>my name</I> be
profaned? and my glory I will not give to another.  <a name="C48V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:12</font></a> Listen to me, O Jacob, and
Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.  <a name="C48V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:13</font></a> Yes, my hand has laid the
foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens:
when I call to them, they stand up together.  <a name="C48V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:14</font></a> Assemble yourselves, all you,
and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom Yahweh loves
shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm <I>shall be on</I> the
Chaldeans.  <a name="C48V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:15</font></a> I, even I,
have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make
his way prosperous.  <a name="C48V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:16</font></a> Come
you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have not spoken in
secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Yahweh has
sent me, and his Spirit.  <a name="C48V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:17</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit,
who leads you by the way that you should go.  <a name="C48V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:18</font></a> Oh that you had listened to my
commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness
as the waves of the sea:  <a name="C48V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:19</font></a> your seed also had been as the
sand, and the offspring of your body like its grains: his name would not
be cut off nor destroyed from before me.  <a name="C48V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:20</font></a> Go you forth from Babylon, flee
you from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare you, tell this,
utter it even to the end of the earth: say you, Yahweh has redeemed his
servant Jacob.  <a name="C48V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:21</font></a> They
didn't thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters
to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters
gushed out.  <a name="C48V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:22</font></a> There is no
peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C49V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:1</font></a> Listen, islands, to
me; and listen, you peoples, from far: Yahweh has called me from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name:  <a name="C49V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:2</font></a> and he has made my mouth like a
sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me: and he has made me a
polished shaft; in his quiver has he kept me close:  <a name="C49V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:3</font></a> and he said to me, You are my
servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.  <a name="C49V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:4</font></a> But I said, I have labored in
vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the
justice <I>due</I> to me is with Yahweh, and my recompense with my God.
 <a name="C49V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:5</font></a> Now says Yahweh who
formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him,
and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of
Yahweh, and my God is become my strength);  <a name="C49V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:6</font></a> yes, he says, It is too light a
thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to
the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.  <a name="C49V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:7</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of
Israel, <I>and</I> his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the
nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise; princes,
and they shall worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful, <I>even</I> the
Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.  <a name="C49V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:8</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, In an
acceptable time have I answered you, and in a day of salvation have I
helped you; and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the
people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage:
 <a name="C49V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:9</font></a> saying to those who are
bound, Go forth; to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall
feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.  <a name="C49V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:10</font></a> They shall not hunger nor
thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy
on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide them.
 <a name="C49V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:11</font></a> I will make all my
mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  <a name="C49V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:12</font></a> Behold, these shall come from
far; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from
the land of Sinim.  <a name="C49V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:13</font></a> Sing,
heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth into singing, mountains:
for Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his
afflicted.  <a name="C49V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:14</font></a> But Zion
said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.  <a name="C49V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:15</font></a> Can a woman forget her sucking
child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes,
these may forget, yet I will not forget you.  <a name="C49V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:16</font></a> Behold, I have engraved you on
the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.  <a name="C49V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:17</font></a> Your children make haste; your
destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you.  <a name="C49V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:18</font></a> Lift up your eyes all around,
and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live,
says Yahweh, you shall surely clothe you with them all as with an
ornament, and gird yourself with them, like a bride.  <a name="C49V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:19</font></a> For, as for your waste and your
desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you
shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up
shall be far away.  <a name="C49V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:20</font></a> The
children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too
small for me; give place to me that I may dwell.  <a name="C49V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:21</font></a> Then you will say in your heart,
Who has conceived these for me, seeing I have been bereaved of my
children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? and who
has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?
 <a name="C49V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:22</font></a> Thus says the Lord
Yahweh, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my
banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and
your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.  <a name="C49V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:23</font></a> Kings shall be your nursing
fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you
with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you
shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me shall not be
disappointed.  <a name="C49V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:24</font></a> Shall the
prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?
 <a name="C49V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:25</font></a> But thus says Yahweh,
Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the
terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with
you, and I will save your children.  <a name="C49V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:26</font></a> I will feed those who oppress
you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood,
as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your
Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C50V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, with which I have put her
away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for
your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother
put away.  <a name="C50V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:2</font></a> Why, when I
came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my
hand shortened at all, that it can't redeem? or have I no power to
deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a
wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for
thirst.  <a name="C50V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:3</font></a> I clothe the
heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.  <a name="C50V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:4</font></a> The Lord Yahweh has given me the
tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words
him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear
as those who are taught.  <a name="C50V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:5</font></a> The Lord Yahweh has opened my
ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.  <a name="C50V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:6</font></a> I gave my back to the strikers,
and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I didn't hide my face
from shame and spitting.  <a name="C50V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:7</font></a> For the Lord Yahweh will help me;
therefore I have not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a
flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed.  <a name="C50V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:8</font></a> He is near who justifies me; who
will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is my
adversary? Let him come near to me.  <a name="C50V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:9</font></a> Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help
me; who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall wax old as a
garment, the moth shall eat them up.  <a name="C50V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:10</font></a> Who is among you who fears
Yahweh, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and
has no light, let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.
 <a name="C50V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:11</font></a> Behold, all you who
kindle a fire, who gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk you in the
flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You shall
have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C51V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:1</font></a> Listen to me, you who
follow after righteousness, you who seek Yahweh: look to the rock whence
you were cut, and to the hold of the pit whence you were dug.  <a name="C51V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:2</font></a> Look to Abraham your father, and
to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed
him, and made him many.  <a name="C51V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:3</font></a> For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he
has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden,
and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.  <a name="C51V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:4</font></a> Attend to me, my people; and give
ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will
establish my justice for a light of the peoples.  <a name="C51V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:5</font></a> My righteousness is near, my
salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples; the islands
shall wait for me, and on my arm shall they trust.  <a name="C51V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:6</font></a> Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like
smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell
therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be forever, and
my righteousness shall not be abolished.  <a name="C51V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:7</font></a> Listen to me, you who know
righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; don't you fear the
reproach of men, neither be you dismayed at their insults.  <a name="C51V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:8</font></a> For the moth shall eat them up
like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my
righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.
 <a name="C51V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:9</font></a> Awake, awake, put on
strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of
ancient times. Isn't it you who did cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the
monster?  <a name="C51V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:10</font></a> Isn't it you
who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of
the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?  <a name="C51V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:11</font></a> The ransomed of Yahweh shall
return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on
their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; <I>and</I> sorrow and
sighing shall flee away.  <a name="C51V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:12</font></a> I, even I, am he who comforts
you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son
of man who shall be made as grass;  <a name="C51V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:13</font></a> and have forgotten Yahweh your
Maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the
oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the
oppressor?  <a name="C51V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:14</font></a> The captive
exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die <I>and go down</I>
into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.  <a name="C51V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:15</font></a> For I am Yahweh your God, who
stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: Yahweh of Armies is his name.
 <a name="C51V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:16</font></a> I have put my words in
your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may
plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion,
You are my people.  <a name="C51V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:17</font></a> Awake, awake, stand up,
Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you
have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.  <a name="C51V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:18</font></a> There is none to guide her among
all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes
her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.  <a name="C51V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:19</font></a> These two things have happened
to you. Who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine
and the sword; how shall I comfort you?  <a name="C51V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:20</font></a> Your sons have fainted, they lie
at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of
the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God.  <a name="C51V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:21</font></a> Therefore hear now this, you
afflicted, and drunken, but now with wine:  <a name="C51V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:22</font></a> Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and
your God who pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of
your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; you
shall no more drink it again:  <a name="C51V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:23</font></a> and I will put it into the hand
of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, Bow down, that we
may go over; and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street,
to those who go over.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C52V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:1</font></a> Awake, awake, put on
your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy
city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised
and the unclean.  <a name="C52V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:2</font></a> Shake
yourself from the dust; arise, sit <I>on your throne</I>, Jerusalem: loose
yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion.  <a name="C52V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:3</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, You were
sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.  <a name="C52V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:4</font></a> For thus says the Lord Yahweh, My
people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there: and the
Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.  <a name="C52V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:5</font></a> Now therefore, what do I here,
says Yahweh, seeing that my people is taken away for nothing? those who
rule over them do howl, says Yahweh, and my name continually all the day
is blasphemed.  <a name="C52V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:6</font></a> Therefore
my people shall know my name: therefore <I>they shall know</I> in that day
that I am he who does speak; behold, it is I.  <a name="C52V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:7</font></a> How beautiful on the mountains
are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings
good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God
reigns!  <a name="C52V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:8</font></a> The voice of your
watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall
see eye to eye, when Yahweh returns to Zion.  <a name="C52V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:9</font></a> Break forth into joy, sing
together, you waste places of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has comforted his
people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.  <a name="C52V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:10</font></a> Yahweh has made bare his holy
arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have
seen the salvation of our God.  <a name="C52V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:11</font></a> Depart you, depart you, go you
out from there, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the midst of her;
cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Yahweh.  <a name="C52V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:12</font></a> For you shall not go out in
haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you; and
the God of Israel will be your rearward.  <a name="C52V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:13</font></a> Behold, my servant shall deal
wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.  <a name="C52V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:14</font></a> Like as many were astonished at
you (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than
the sons of men),  <a name="C52V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:15</font></a> so
shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for
that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had
not heard shall they understand.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C53V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:1</font></a> Who has believed our
message?
<dd>To whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?
<dt> <a name="C53V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:2</font></a> For he grew up before
him as a tender plant,
<dd>and as a root out of dry ground.
<dt>He has no form nor comeliness.
<dd>When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
<dt> <a name="C53V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:3</font></a> He was despised,
<dd>and rejected by men;
<dt>a man of suffering,
<dd>and acquainted with disease.
<dt>He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;
<dd>and we didn't respect him.
<dt> <a name="C53V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:4</font></a> Surely he has borne
our sickness,
<dd>and carried our suffering;
<dt>yet we considered him plagued,
<dd>struck by God, and afflicted.
<dt> <a name="C53V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:5</font></a> But he was pierced
for our transgressions.
<dd>He was crushed for our iniquities.
<dt>The punishment that brought our peace was on him;
<dd>and by his wounds we are healed.
<dt> <a name="C53V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:6</font></a> All we like sheep
have gone astray.
<dd>Everyone has turned to his own way;
<dd>and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
<dt> <a name="C53V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:7</font></a> He was oppressed,
<dd>yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth.
<dt>As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
<dd>and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,
<dd>so he didn't open his mouth.
<dt> <a name="C53V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:8</font></a> He was taken away by
oppression and judgment;
<dd>and as for his generation,
<dd>who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living
<dd>and stricken for the disobedience of my people?
<dt> <a name="C53V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:9</font></a> They made his grave
with the wicked,
<dd>and with a rich man in his death;
<dt>although he had done no violence,
<dd>neither was any deceit in his mouth.
<dt> <a name="C53V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:10</font></a> Yet it pleased
Yahweh to bruise him.
<dd>He has caused him to suffer.
<dt>When you make his soul an offering for sin,
<dd>he shall see his seed.
<dt>He shall prolong his days,
<dd>and the pleasure of Yahweh shall prosper in his hand.
<dt> <a name="C53V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:11</font></a> After the suffering
of his soul,
<dd>he will see the <a href="#N11">light</a> and be satisfied.
<dt>My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
<dd>and he will bear their iniquities.
<dt> <a name="C53V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">53:12</font></a> Therefore will I
divide him a portion with the great,
<dd>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
<dt>because he poured out his soul to death,
<dd>and was numbered with the transgressors;
<dt>yet he bore the sin of many,
<dd>and made intercession for the transgressors.

<p> <a name="C54V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:1</font></a> Sing, barren, you who
didn't bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not
travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
children of the married wife, says Yahweh.  <a name="C54V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:2</font></a> Enlarge the place of your tent,
and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; don't spare:
lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.  <a name="C54V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:3</font></a> For you shall spread aboard on
the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations,
and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.  <a name="C54V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:4</font></a> Don't be afraid; for you shall
not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed:
for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your
widowhood you shall remember no more.  <a name="C54V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:5</font></a> For your Maker is your husband;
Yahweh of Armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer;
the God of the whole earth shall he be called.  <a name="C54V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:6</font></a> For Yahweh has called you as a
wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is
cast off, says your God.  <a name="C54V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:7</font></a> For a small moment have I
forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.  <a name="C54V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:8</font></a> In overflowing wrath I hid my
face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving kindness will I
have mercy on you, says Yahweh your Redeemer.  <a name="C54V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:9</font></a> For this is <I>as</I> the waters
of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more
go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor
rebuke you.  <a name="C54V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:10</font></a> For the
mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving kindness
shall not depart from you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed,
says Yahweh who has mercy on you.  <a name="C54V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:11</font></a> You afflicted, tossed with
storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful
colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.  <a name="C54V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:12</font></a> I will make your pinnacles of
rubies, and your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious
stones.  <a name="C54V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:13</font></a> All your
children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall be the peace of your
children.  <a name="C54V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:14</font></a> In
righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression,
for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near
you.  <a name="C54V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:15</font></a> Behold, they may
gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you
shall fall because of you.  <a name="C54V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:16</font></a> Behold, I have created the smith
who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I
have created the waster to destroy.  <a name="C54V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">54:17</font></a> No weapon that is formed against
you shall prosper; and you will condemn every tongue that rises against
you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their
righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.
<p>
<p> <a name="C55V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:1</font></a> Ho, everyone who
thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has no money; come you, buy,
and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
 <a name="C55V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:2</font></a> Why do you spend money
for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn't
satisfy? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let
your soul delight itself in fatness.  <a name="C55V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:3</font></a> Turn your ear, and come to me;
hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant
with you, even the sure mercies of David.  <a name="C55V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:4</font></a> Behold, I have given him for a
witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.  <a name="C55V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:5</font></a> Behold, you shall call a nation
that you don't know; and a nation that didn't know you shall run to you,
because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has
glorified you.  <a name="C55V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:6</font></a> Seek you
Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while he is near:  <a name="C55V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:7</font></a> let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he
will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
 <a name="C55V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:8</font></a> For my thoughts are not
your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says Yahweh.  <a name="C55V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:9</font></a> For as the heavens are higher
than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than
your thoughts.  <a name="C55V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:10</font></a> For as
the rain comes down and the snow from the sky, and doesn't return there,
but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to
the sower and bread to the eater;  <a name="C55V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:11</font></a> so shall my word be that goes
forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall
accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent
it to do.  <a name="C55V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:12</font></a> For you shall
go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills
shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields
shall clap their hands.  <a name="C55V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">55:13</font></a> Instead of the thorn shall come
up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:
and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall
not be cut off.
<p>
<p> <a name="C56V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Keep
you justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and
my righteousness to be revealed.  <a name="C56V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:2</font></a> Blessed is the man who does this,
and the son of man who holds it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning
it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.  <a name="C56V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:3</font></a> Neither let the foreigner, who
has joined himself to Yahweh, speak, saying, Yahweh will surely separate
me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
 <a name="C56V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:4</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of
the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me,
and hold fast my covenant:  <a name="C56V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:5</font></a> To them will I give in my house
and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of
daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut
off.  <a name="C56V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:6</font></a> Also the foreigners
who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister to him, and to love the name of
Yahweh, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning
it, and holds fast my covenant;  <a name="C56V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:7</font></a> even them will I bring to my holy
mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt
offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house
shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.  <a name="C56V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:8</font></a> The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the
outcasts of Israel, says, Yet will I gather <I>others</I> to him, besides
his own who are gathered.  <a name="C56V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:9</font></a> All you animals of the field,
come to devour, <I>yes</I>, all you animals in the forest.  <a name="C56V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:10</font></a> His watchmen are blind, they are
all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming,
lying down, loving to slumber.  <a name="C56V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:11</font></a> Yes, the dogs are greedy, they
can never have enough; and these are shepherds who can't understand: they
have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every
quarter.  <a name="C56V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">56:12</font></a> Come you,
<I>say they</I>, I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong
drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, <I>a day</I> great beyond
measure.
<p>
<p> <a name="C57V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:1</font></a> The righteous
perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away,
none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil <I>to
come</I>.  <a name="C57V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:2</font></a> He enters into
peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.
 <a name="C57V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:3</font></a> But draw near here, you
sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.
 <a name="C57V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:4</font></a> Against whom do you sport
yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and put out the tongue?
Aren't you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,  <a name="C57V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:5</font></a> you who inflame yourselves among
the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys,
under the clefts of the rocks?  <a name="C57V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:6</font></a> Among the smooth <I>stones</I> of
the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; even to them have you
poured a drink offering, you have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased
for these things?  <a name="C57V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:7</font></a> On a
high and lofty mountain have you set your bed; there also you went up to
offer sacrifice.  <a name="C57V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:8</font></a> Behind
the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial: for you have
uncovered <I>yourself</I> to another than me, and are gone up; you have
enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them: you loved their bed
where you saw it.  <a name="C57V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:9</font></a> You
went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes, and did send
your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself even to Sheol.  <a name="C57V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:10</font></a> You were wearied with the length
of your way; yet you didn't say, It is in vain: you found a reviving of
your strength; therefore you weren't faint.  <a name="C57V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:11</font></a> Of whom have you been afraid and
in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your
heart? Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you don't fear me?
 <a name="C57V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:12</font></a> I will declare your
righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.  <a name="C57V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:13</font></a> When you cry, let those who you
have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall
carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land,
and shall inherit my holy mountain.  <a name="C57V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:14</font></a> He will say, Cast up, cast up,
prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
 <a name="C57V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:15</font></a> For thus says the high
and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the
high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite.  <a name="C57V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:16</font></a> For I will not
contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would
faint before me, and the souls who I have made.  <a name="C57V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:17</font></a> For the iniquity of his
covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid <I>my face</I> and was
angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.  <a name="C57V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:18</font></a> I have seen his ways, and will
heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his
mourners.  <a name="C57V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:19</font></a> I create the
fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is
near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.  <a name="C57V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:20</font></a> But the wicked are like the
troubled sea; for it can't rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
 <a name="C57V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">57:21</font></a> There is no peace, says
my God, to the wicked.
<p>
<p> <a name="C58V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:1</font></a> Cry aloud, don't
spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their
disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins.  <a name="C58V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:2</font></a> Yet they seek me daily, and
delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and didn't
forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments;
they delight to draw near to God.  <a name="C58V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:3</font></a> Why have we fasted, <I>say
they</I>, and you don't see? <I>why</I> have we afflicted our soul, and
you take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast you find <I>your
own</I> pleasure, and exact all your labors.  <a name="C58V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:4</font></a> Behold, you fast for strife and
contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you don't fast this
day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.  <a name="C58V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:5</font></a> Is such the fast that I have
chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head
as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this
a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?  <a name="C58V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:6</font></a> Isn't this the fast that I have
chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke,
and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?  <a name="C58V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:7</font></a> Isn't it to deal your bread to
the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house?
when you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself
from your own flesh?  <a name="C58V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:8</font></a> Then
your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring
forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of
Yahweh shall be your rear guard.  <a name="C58V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:9</font></a> Then you shall call, and Yahweh
will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, Here I am. If you take away
from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
speaking wickedly;  <a name="C58V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:10</font></a> and
if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul:
then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the
noonday;  <a name="C58V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:11</font></a> and Yahweh will
guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make
strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a
spring of water, whose waters don't fail.  <a name="C58V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:12</font></a> Those who shall be of you shall
build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many
generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The
restorer of paths to dwell in.  <a name="C58V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:13</font></a> If you turn away your foot from
the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath
a delight, <I>and</I> the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it,
not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking
<I>your own</I> words:  <a name="C58V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">58:14</font></a> then you shall delight yourself
in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth;
and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth
of Yahweh has spoken it.
<p>
<p> <a name="C59V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:1</font></a> Behold, Yahweh's hand
is not shortened, that it can't save; neither his ear heavy, that it can't
hear:  <a name="C59V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:2</font></a> but your iniquities
have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his
face from you, so that he will not hear.  <a name="C59V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:3</font></a> For your hands are defiled with
blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your
tongue mutters wickedness.  <a name="C59V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:4</font></a> None sues in righteousness, and
none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive
mischief, and bring forth iniquity.  <a name="C59V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:5</font></a> They hatch adders' eggs, and
weave the spider's web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is
crushed breaks out into a viper.  <a name="C59V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:6</font></a> Their webs shall not become
garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their
works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
 <a name="C59V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:7</font></a> Their feet run to evil,
and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of
iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.  <a name="C59V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:8</font></a> The way of peace they don't know;
and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked
paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace.  <a name="C59V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:9</font></a> Therefore is justice far from us,
neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold,
darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.  <a name="C59V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:10</font></a> We grope for the wall like the
blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as
in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.  <a name="C59V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:11</font></a> We roar all like bears, and moan
sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation,
but it is far off from us.  <a name="C59V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:12</font></a> For our transgressions are
multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our
transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
 <a name="C59V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:13</font></a> transgressing and
denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking
oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of
falsehood.  <a name="C59V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:14</font></a> Justice is
turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is
fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter.  <a name="C59V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:15</font></a> Yes, truth is lacking; and he
who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Yahweh saw it, and it
displeased him that there was no justice.  <a name="C59V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:16</font></a> He saw that there was no man,
and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought
salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.  <a name="C59V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:17</font></a> He put on righteousness as a
breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments
of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.  <a name="C59V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:18</font></a> According to their deeds,
accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his
enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.  <a name="C59V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:19</font></a> So shall they fear the name of
Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he
will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.  <a name="C59V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:20</font></a> A Redeemer will come to Zion,
and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob, says Yahweh.  <a name="C59V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">59:21</font></a> As for me, this is my covenant
with them, says Yahweh: my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have
put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the
mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, says Yahweh,
from henceforth and forever.
<p>
<p> <a name="C60V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:1</font></a> Arise, shine; for your
light is come, and the glory of Yahweh is risen on you.  <a name="C60V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:2</font></a> For, behold, darkness shall cover
the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you,
and his glory shall be seen on you.  <a name="C60V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:3</font></a> Nations shall come to your light,
and kings to the brightness of your rising.  <a name="C60V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:4</font></a> Lift up your eyes all around, and
see: they all gather themselves together, they come to you; your sons
shall come from far, and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
 <a name="C60V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:5</font></a> Then you shall see and be
radiant, and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the
abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations
shall come to you.  <a name="C60V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:6</font></a> The
multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah;
all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense,
and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh.  <a name="C60V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:7</font></a> All the flocks of Kedar shall be
gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they
shall come up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house of
my glory.  <a name="C60V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:8</font></a> Who are these
who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?  <a name="C60V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:9</font></a> Surely the islands shall wait for
me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their
silver and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God, and for
the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.  <a name="C60V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:10</font></a> Foreigners shall build up your
walls, and their kings shall minister to you: for in my wrath I struck
you, but in my favor have I had mercy on you.  <a name="C60V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:11</font></a> Your gates also shall be open
continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to
you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.  <a name="C60V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:12</font></a> For that nation and kingdom that
will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly
wasted.  <a name="C60V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:13</font></a> The glory of
Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree
together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place
of my feet glorious.  <a name="C60V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:14</font></a> The
sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you; and all those
who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and
they shall call you The city of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of
Israel.  <a name="C60V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:15</font></a> Whereas you have
been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make
you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.  <a name="C60V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:16</font></a> You shall also suck the milk of
the nations, and shall suck the breast of kings; and you shall know that
I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
 <a name="C60V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:17</font></a> For brass I will bring
gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones
iron. I will also make your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
 <a name="C60V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:18</font></a> Violence shall no more
be heard in your land, desolation nor destruction within your borders; but
you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.  <a name="C60V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:19</font></a> The sun shall be no more your
light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but
Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
 <a name="C60V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:20</font></a> Your sun shall no more
go down, neither shall your moon withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your
everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.  <a name="C60V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:21</font></a> Your people also shall be all
righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting,
the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.  <a name="C60V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">60:22</font></a> The little one shall become a
thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hasten it in
its time.
<p>
<p> <a name="C61V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:1</font></a> The Spirit of the Lord
Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the
humble; he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty
to the captives, and the opening <I>of the prison</I> to those who are
bound;  <a name="C61V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:2</font></a> to proclaim the
year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort
all who mourn;  <a name="C61V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:3</font></a> to appoint
to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil
of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh,
that he may be glorified.  <a name="C61V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:4</font></a> They shall build the old wastes,
they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the
waste cities, the desolations of many generations.  <a name="C61V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:5</font></a> Strangers shall stand and feed
your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
 <a name="C61V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:6</font></a> But you shall be named
the priests of Yahweh; men will call you the ministers of our God: you
will eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you will boast
yourselves.  <a name="C61V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:7</font></a> Instead of
your shame <I>you shall have</I> double; and instead of dishonor they
shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess
double; everlasting joy shall be to them.  <a name="C61V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:8</font></a> For I, Yahweh, love justice, I
hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in
truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.  <a name="C61V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:9</font></a> Their seed shall be known among
the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall
acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.  <a name="C61V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:10</font></a> I will greatly rejoice in
Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the
garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns
herself with her jewels.  <a name="C61V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">61:11</font></a> For as the earth brings forth
its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring
forth; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring
forth before all the nations.
<p>
<p> <a name="C62V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:1</font></a> For Zion's sake will I
not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her
righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that
burns.  <a name="C62V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:2</font></a> The nations shall
see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called
by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh shall name.  <a name="C62V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:3</font></a> You shall also be a crown of
beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
 <a name="C62V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:4</font></a> You shall no more be
termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but
you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights
in you, and your land shall be married.  <a name="C62V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:5</font></a> For as a young man marries a
virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over
the bride, so your God will rejoice over you.  <a name="C62V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:6</font></a> I have set watchmen on your
walls, Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who
call on Yahweh, take no rest,  <a name="C62V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:7</font></a> and give him no rest, until he
establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.  <a name="C62V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:8</font></a> Yahweh has sworn by his right
hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your
grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners shall not drink your new
wine, for which you have labored:  <a name="C62V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:9</font></a> but those who have garnered it
shall eat it, and praise Yahweh; and those who have gathered it shall
drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.  <a name="C62V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:10</font></a> Go through, go through the
gates; prepare you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway;
gather out the stones; lift up a banner for the peoples.  <a name="C62V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:11</font></a> Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to
the end of the earth, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your
salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before
him.  <a name="C62V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">62:12</font></a> They shall call
them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh: and you shall be called
Sought out, A city not forsaken.
<p>
<p> <a name="C63V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:1</font></a> Who is this who comes
from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this who is glorious in his
clothing, marching in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in
righteousness, mighty to save.  <a name="C63V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:2</font></a> Why are you red in your clothing,
and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?  <a name="C63V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:3</font></a> I have trodden the winepress
alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod them in my
anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on
my garments, and I have stained all my clothing.  <a name="C63V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:4</font></a> For the day of vengeance was in
my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.  <a name="C63V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:5</font></a> I looked, and there was none to
help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm
brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me.  <a name="C63V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:6</font></a> I trod down the peoples in my
anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood
on the earth.  <a name="C63V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:7</font></a> I will make
mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh, <I>and</I> the praises of
Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has bestowed on us, and the great
goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them
according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving
kindnesses.  <a name="C63V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:8</font></a> For he said,
Surely, they are my people, children who will not deal falsely: so he was
their Savior.  <a name="C63V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:9</font></a> In all
their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved
them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and
carried them all the days of old.  <a name="C63V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:10</font></a> But they rebelled, and grieved
his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, <I>and</I>
himself fought against them.  <a name="C63V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:11</font></a> Then he remembered the days of
old, Moses <I>and</I> his people, <I>saying</I>, Where is he who brought
them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who
put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?  <a name="C63V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:12</font></a> who caused his glorious arm to
go at the right hand of Moses? who divided the waters before them, to make
himself an everlasting name?  <a name="C63V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:13</font></a> who led them through the depths,
as a horse in the wilderness, so that they didn't stumble?  <a name="C63V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:14</font></a> As the livestock that go down
into the valley, the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest; so did you lead
your people, to make yourself a glorious name.  <a name="C63V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:15</font></a> Look down from heaven, and see
from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where are your
zeal and your mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion
is restrained toward me.  <a name="C63V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:16</font></a> For you are our Father, though
Abraham doesn't know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you, Yahweh,
are our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.  <a name="C63V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:17</font></a> O Yahweh, why do you make us to
err from your ways, and harden our heart from your fear? Return for your
servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.  <a name="C63V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:18</font></a> Your holy people possessed
<I>it</I> but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your
sanctuary.  <a name="C63V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">63:19</font></a> We are become
as they over whom you never bear rule, as those who were not called by
your name.
<p>
<p> <a name="C64V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:1</font></a> Oh that you would tear
the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at
your presence,  <a name="C64V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:2</font></a> as when
fire kindles the brushwood, <I>and</I> the fire causes the waters to boil;
to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble
at your presence!  <a name="C64V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:3</font></a> When
you did terrible things which we didn't look for, you came down, the
mountains quaked at your presence.  <a name="C64V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:4</font></a> For from of old men have not
heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides
you, who works for him who waits for him.  <a name="C64V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:5</font></a> You meet him who rejoices and
works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways: behold, you were
angry, and we sinned: in them <I>have we been</I> of long time; and shall
we be saved?  <a name="C64V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:6</font></a> For we have
all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a
polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the
wind, take us away.  <a name="C64V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:7</font></a> There
is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you;
for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our
iniquities.  <a name="C64V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:8</font></a> But now,
Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we
all are the work of your hand.  <a name="C64V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:9</font></a> Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither
remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.
 <a name="C64V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:10</font></a> Your holy cities are
become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
 <a name="C64V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:11</font></a> Our holy and our
beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and
all our pleasant places are laid waste.  <a name="C64V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">64:12</font></a> Will you refrain yourself for
these things, Yahweh? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?
<p>
<p> <a name="C65V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:1</font></a> I am inquired of by
those who didn't ask; I am found by those who didn't seek me: I said, See
me, see me, to a nation that was not called by my name.  <a name="C65V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:2</font></a> I have spread out my hands all
the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after
their own thoughts;  <a name="C65V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:3</font></a> a
people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and
burning incense on bricks;  <a name="C65V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:4</font></a> who sit among the graves, and
lodge in the secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable
things is in their vessels;  <a name="C65V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:5</font></a> who say, Stand by yourself, don't
come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a
fire that burns all the day.  <a name="C65V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:6</font></a> Behold, it is written before me:
I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into
their bosom,  <a name="C65V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:7</font></a> your own
iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Yahweh, who
have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills;
therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.  <a name="C65V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:8</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine
is found in the cluster, and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is
in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them
all.  <a name="C65V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:9</font></a> I will bring forth a
seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my
chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.  <a name="C65V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:10</font></a> Sharon shall be a fold of
flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my
people who have sought me.  <a name="C65V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:11</font></a> But you who forsake Yahweh, who
forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up
mixed wine to Destiny;  <a name="C65V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:12</font></a> I
will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the
slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you
did not hear; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that
in which I didn't delight.  <a name="C65V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:13</font></a> Therefore thus says the Lord
Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my
servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall
rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;  <a name="C65V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:14</font></a> behold, my servants shall sing
for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail
for anguish of spirit.  <a name="C65V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:15</font></a> You shall leave your name for a
curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call
his servants by another name:  <a name="C65V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:16</font></a> so that he who blesses himself
in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in
the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.  <a name="C65V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:17</font></a> For, behold, I create new
heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered,
nor come into mind.  <a name="C65V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:18</font></a> But
be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I
create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.  <a name="C65V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:19</font></a> I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and
joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of
weeping and the voice of crying.  <a name="C65V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:20</font></a> There shall be no more there an
infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child
shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years
old shall be accursed.  <a name="C65V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:21</font></a> They shall build houses, and
inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
 <a name="C65V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:22</font></a> They shall not build,
and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the
days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long
enjoy the work of their hands.  <a name="C65V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:23</font></a> They shall not labor in vain,
nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of
Yahweh, and their offspring with them.  <a name="C65V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:24</font></a> It shall happen that, before
they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
 <a name="C65V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">65:25</font></a> The wolf and the lamb
shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust
shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain, says Yahweh.
<p>
<p> <a name="C66V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house
will you build to me? and what place shall be my rest?  <a name="C66V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:2</font></a> For all these things has my hand
made, and <I>so</I> all these things came to be, says Yahweh: but to this
man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who
trembles at my word.  <a name="C66V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:3</font></a> He
who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he
who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, <I>as he who
offers</I> pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an
idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in
their abominations:  <a name="C66V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:4</font></a> I
also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them;
because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear:
but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I
didn't delight.  <a name="C66V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:5</font></a> Hear the
word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you,
who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let Yahweh be glorified,
that we may see your joy; but it is those who shall be disappointed.
 <a name="C66V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:6</font></a> A voice of tumult from
the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh that renders
recompense to his enemies.  <a name="C66V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:7</font></a> Before she travailed, she brought
forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a boy.  <a name="C66V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:8</font></a> Who has heard such a thing? who
has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be
brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth
her children.  <a name="C66V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:9</font></a> Shall I
bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Yahweh: shall I who
cause to bring forth shut <I>the womb</I>? says your God.  <a name="C66V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:10</font></a> Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and
be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you
who mourn over her;  <a name="C66V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:11</font></a> that
you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that
you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
 <a name="C66V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:12</font></a> For thus says Yahweh,
Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the
nations like an overflowing stream: and you shall suck <I>of it</I>; you
shall be borne on the side, and shall be dandled on the knees.  <a name="C66V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:13</font></a> As one whom his mother comforts,
so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.  <a name="C66V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:14</font></a> You shall see <I>it</I>, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender
grass: and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants; and he
will have indignation against his enemies.  <a name="C66V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:15</font></a> For, behold, Yahweh will come
with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his
anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.  <a name="C66V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:16</font></a> For by fire will Yahweh execute
judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be
many.  <a name="C66V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:17</font></a> Those who sanctify
themselves and purify themselves <I>to go</I> to the gardens, behind one
in the midst, eating pig's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they
shall come to an end together, says Yahweh.  <a name="C66V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:18</font></a> For I <I>know</I> their works
and their thoughts: <I>the time</I> comes, that I will gather all nations
and languages; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.  <a name="C66V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:19</font></a> I will set a sign among them,
and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul,
and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off,
who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall
declare my glory among the nations.  <a name="C66V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:20</font></a> They shall bring all your
brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, and
in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy
mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their
offering in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C66V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:21</font></a> Of them also will I take for
priests <I>and</I> for Levites, says Yahweh.  <a name="C66V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:22</font></a> For as the new heavens and the
new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says Yahweh, so your
seed and your name shall remain.  <a name="C66V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:23</font></a> It shall happen, that from one
new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come
to worship before me, says Yahweh.  <a name="C66V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">66:24</font></a> They shall go forth, and look on
the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their
worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall
be an abhorring to all flesh.

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>

ways.</p>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
