<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Two of the earlier, and, in some respects, more
important <cite>Memoirs</cite> of Oliver Goldsmith open with a
quotation from one of his minor works, in which he refers to the
generally uneventful life of the scholar. His own chequered career
was a notable exception to this rule. <u>He was born on the 10th of
November, 1728, at Pallas,</u> a village in the county of Longford
in Ireland, his father, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith, being a
clergyman of the Established Church. Oliver was the fifth of a
family of five sons and three daughters. In 1730, his father, who
had been assisting the rector of the neighbouring parish of
Kilkenny West, succeeded to that living, and moved to Lissoy, a
hamlet in Westmeath, lying a little to the right of the road from
Ballymahon to Athlone. Educated first by a humble relative named
Elizabeth Delap, the boy passed subsequently to the care of Thomas
Byrne, the village schoolmaster, an old soldier who had fought
Queen Anne's battles in Spain, and had retained from those
experiences a wandering and unsettled spirit, which he is thought
to have communicated to one at least of his pupils. After an attack
of confluent small-pox, which scarred him for life, Oliver was
transferred from the care of this not-uncongenial preceptor to a
school at Elphin. From Elphin he passed to Athlone; from Athlone to
Edgeworthstown, where he remained until he was thirteen or fourteen
years of age. The accounts of these early days are contradictory.
By his schoolfellows he seems to have been regarded as stupid and
heavy,&mdash;'little better than a fool'; but they</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">admitted that he was remarkably active and
athletic, and that he was an adept in all boyish sports. At home,
notwithstanding a variable disposition, and occasional fits of
depression, he showed to greater advantage. He scribbled verses
early; and sometimes startled those about him by unexpected
'swallow- flights' of repartee. One of these, an oft-quoted retort
to a musical friend who had likened his awkward antics in a
hornpipe to the dancing of Aesop,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><small>Heralds! proclaim aloud! all saying,<br>
See <i>Aesop</i> dancing, and his <i>monkey</i>
playing,&mdash;</small></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">reads more like a happily-adapted recollection
than the actual impromptu of a boy of nine. But another, in which,
after a painful silence, he replied to the brutal enquiry of a
ne'er-do-well relative as to when he meant to grow handsome, by
saying that he would do so when the speaker grew good,&mdash;is
characteristic of the easily-wounded spirit and 'exquisite
sensibility of contempt' with which he was to enter upon the battle
of life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In June, 1744, after anticipating in his own
person, the plot of his later play of <cite>She Stoops to
Conquer</cite> by mistaking the house of a gentleman at Ardagh for
an inn, he was sent to Trinity College, Dublin. The special dress
and semi-menial footing of a sizar or poor scholar&mdash;for his
father, impoverished by the imprudent portioning of his eldest
daughter, could not afford to make him a pensioner&mdash;were
scarcely calculated to modify his personal peculiarities. Added to
these, his tutor elect, Dr. Theaker Wilder, was a violent and
vindictive man, with whom his ungainly and unhopeful pupil found
little favour. Wilder had a passion for mathematics which was not
shared by Goldsmith, who, indeed, spoke contemptuously enough of
that science in after life. He could, however, he told Malone,
'turn an Ode of Horace into English better than any of them.' But
<u>his academic career was not a success.</u></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In May, 1747, the year in which his father
died,&mdash;an event that further contracted his already slender
means,&mdash;he became involved in a college riot, and was publicly
admonished. From this disgrace he recovered to some extent in the
following month by obtaining a trifling money exhibition, a triumph
which he unluckily celebrated by a party at his rooms. Into these
festivities, the heinousness of which was aggravated by the fact
that they included guests of both sexes, the exasperated Wilder
made irruption, and summarily terminated the proceedings by
knocking down the host. The disgrace was too much for the poor lad.
He forthwith sold his books and belongings, and ran away, vaguely
bound for America. But after considerable privations, including the
achievement of a destitution so complete that a handful of grey
peas, given him by a girl at a wake, seemed a banquet, he turned
his steps homeward, and, a reconciliation having been patched up
with his tutor, he was received once more at college. In February,
1749, he took his degree, a low one, as B.A., and quitted the
university, leaving behind him, for relics of that time, <u>a
scratched signature upon a window-pane,</u> a <i>folio</i> Scapula
scored liberally with 'promises to pay,' and a reputation for much
loitering at the college gates in the study of passing humanity.
Another habit which his associates recalled was his writing of
ballads when in want of funds. These he would sell at five
shillings apiece; and would afterwards steal out in the twilight to
hear them sung to the indiscriminate but applauding audience of the
Dublin streets.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What was to be done with a genius so unstable,
so erratic? Nothing, apparently, but to let him qualify for orders,
and for this he is too young. Thereupon ensues a sort of 'Martin's
summer' in his changing life,&mdash;a disengaged, delightful time
when 'Master Noll' wanders</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">irresponsibly from house to house, fishing and
flute-playing, or, of winter evenings, taking the chair at the
village inn. When at last the moment came for his presentation to
the Bishop of Elphin, that prelate, sad to say, rejected him,
perhaps because of his college reputation, perhaps because of
actual incompetence, perhaps even, as tradition affirms, because he
had the bad taste to appear before his examiner in flaming scarlet
breeches. After this rebuff, tutoring was next tried. But he had no
sooner saved some thirty pounds by teaching, than he threw up his
engagement, bought a horse, and started once more for America, by
way of Cork. In six weeks he had returned penniless, having
substituted for his roadster a sorry jade, to which he gave the
contemptuous name of Fiddleback. He had also the simplicity to
wonder, on this occasion, that his mother was not rejoiced to see
him again. His next ambition was to be a lawyer; and, to this end,
a kindly Uncle Contarine equipped him with fifty pounds for
preliminary studies. But on his way to London he was decoyed into
gambling, lost every farthing, and came home once more in bitter
self-abasement. Having now essayed both divinity and law, his next
attempt was physic; and, in 1752, fitted out afresh by his
long-suffering uncle, he started for, and succeeded in reaching,
Edinburgh. Here more memories survive of his social qualities than
of his studies; and two years later he left the Scottish capital
for Leyden, rather, it may be conjectured, from a restless desire
to see the world than really to exchange the lectures of Monro for
the lectures of Albinus. At Newcastle (according to his own
account) he had the good fortune to be locked up as a Jacobite, and
thus escaped drowning, as the ship by which he was to have sailed
to Bordeaux sank at the mouth of the Garonne. Shortly afterwards he
arrived in Leyden. Gaubius and other Dutch professors figure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">sonorously in his future works; but whether he
had much experimental knowledge of their instructions may be
doubted. What seems undeniable is, that the old seduction of play
stripped him of every shilling; so that, like Holberg before him,
he set out deliberately to make the tour of Europe on foot. <i>Haud
inexpertus loquor,</i> he wrote in after days, when praising this
mode of locomotion. He first visited Flanders. Thence he passed to
France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, supporting himself mainly
by his flute, and by occasional disputations at convents or
universities. 'Sir,' said Boswell to Johnson, 'he <i>disputed</i>
his passage through Europe.' When on the 1st February, 1756, he
landed at Dover, it was with empty pockets. But he had sent home to
his brother in Ireland his first rough sketch for the poem of
<cite>The Traveller</cite>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He was now seven-and-twenty. He had seen and
suffered much, but he was to have further trials before drifting
definitely into literature. Between Dover and London, it has been
surmised, he made a tentative appearance as a strolling player. His
next ascertained part was that of an apothecary's assistant on Fish
Street Hill. From this, with the opportune aid of an Edinburgh
friend, he proceeded&mdash;to use an eighteenth-century
phrase&mdash;<u>a poor physician</u> in the Bankside, Southwark,
where least of all, perhaps, was London's fabled pavement to be
found. So little of it, in fact, fell to Goldsmith's share, that we
speedily find him reduced to the rank of reader and corrector of
the press to Samuel Richardson, printer, of Salisbury Court, author
of <cite>Clarissa</cite>. Later still he is acting as help or
substitute in Dr. Milner's 'classical academy' at Peckham. Here, at
last, chance seemed to open to him the prospect of a literary life.
He had already, says report, submitted a manuscript tragedy to
Richardson's judgement; and something he said at Dr. Milner's table
attracted the attention of an occasional</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">visitor there, the bookseller Griffiths, who was
also proprietor of the <cite>Monthly Review.</cite> He invited Dr.
Milner's usher to try his hand at criticism; and finally, in April,
1757, Goldsmith was bound over for a year to that venerable lady
whom George Primrose dubs 'the <i>antiqua mater</i> of Grub
Street'&mdash;in other words, he was engaged for bed, board, and a
fixed salary to supply copy-of- all-work to his master's
magazine.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The arrangement thus concluded was not
calculated to endure. After some five months of labour from nine
till two, and often later, it came suddenly to an end. No clear
explanation of the breach is forthcoming, but mere incompatability
of temper would probably supply a sufficient ground for
disagreement. Goldsmith, it is said, complained that the bookseller
and his wife treated him ill, and denied him ordinary comforts;
added to which the lady, a harder taskmistress even than the <i>
antiqua mater</i> above referred to, joined with her husband in
'editing' his articles, a course which, hard though it may seem, is
not unprecedented. However this may be, either in September or
October, 1757, he was again upon the world, existing precariously
from hand to mouth. 'By a very little practice as a physician, and
very little reputation as a poet [a title which, as Prior suggests,
possibly means no more than author], I make a shift to live.' So he
wrote to his brother-in-law in December. What his literary
occupations were cannot be definitely stated; but, if not prepared
before, they probably included the translation of a remarkable work
issued by Griffiths and others in the ensuing February. This was
the <cite>Memoirs of a Protestant, condemned to the Galleys of
France for his Religion,</cite> being the authentic record of the
sufferings of one Jean Marteilhe of Bergerac, a book of which
Michelet has said that it is 'written as if between earth and
heaven.' Marteilhe, who died at Cuylenberg</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page xv"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">in 1777, was living in Holland in 1758; and it
may be that Goldsmith had seen or heard of him during his own stay
in that country. The translation, however, did not bear Goldsmith's
name, but that of James Willington, one of his old class-fellows at
Trinity College. Nevertheless, Prior says distinctly that Griffiths
(who should have known) <u>declared it to be by Goldsmith.</u>
Moreover, the French original had been catalogued in Griffiths'
magazine in the second month of Goldsmith's servitude, a
circumstance which colourably supplies the reason for its
subsequent rendering into English.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The publication of Marteilhe's <cite>
Memoirs</cite> had no influence upon Goldsmith's fortunes, for, in
a short time, he was again installed at Peckham, in place of Dr.
Milner invalided, waiting hopefully for the fulfilment of a promise
by his old master to procure him a medical appointment on a foreign
station. It is probably that, with a view to provide the needful
funds for this expatriation, he now began to sketch the little
volume afterwards published under the title of <cite>An Enquiry
into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe</cite>, for
towards the middle of the year we find him addressing long letters
to his relatives in Ireland to enlist their aid in soliciting
subscriptions for this book. At length the desired advancement was
obtained,&mdash;a nomination as a physician and surgeon to one of
the factories on the coast of Coromandel. But banishment to the
East Indies was not to be his destiny. For some unexplained reason
the project came to nothing; and then&mdash;like Roderick
Random&mdash;he presented himself at Surgeons' Hall for the more
modest office of a hospital mate. This was on the 21st of December,
1758. The curt official record states that he was 'found not
qualified.' What made matters worse, the necessity for a decent
appearance before the examiners had involved him in new obligations
to Griffiths,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">out of which arose fresh difficulties. To pay
his landlady, whose husband was arrested for debt, he pawned the
suit he had procured by Griffiths' aid; and he also raised money on
some volumes which had been sent him for review. Thereupon ensued
an angry and humiliating correspondence with the bookseller, as a
result of which Griffiths, nevertheless, appears to have held his
hand.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">By this time Goldsmith had moved into those
historic but now non- existent lodgings in <u>12 Green Arbour
Court, Old Bailey</u>, which have been photographed for ever in
Irving's <cite>Tales of a Traveller.</cite> It was here that the
foregoing incidents took place; and it was here also that, early in
1759, 'in a wretched dirty room, in which there was but one chair,'
the Rev. Thomas Percy, afterwards Bishop of Dromore, found him
composing (or more probably correcting the proofs of) <cite>The
Enquiry.</cite> 'At least spare invective 'till my book with Mr.
Dodsley shall be publish'd,'&mdash;he had written not long before
to the irate Griffiths&mdash;'and then perhaps you may see the
bright side of a mind when my professions shall not appear the
dictates of necessity but of choice.' <cite>The Enquiry</cite> came
out on the 2nd of April. It had no author's name, but it was an
open secret that Goldsmith had written it; and to this day it
remains to the critic one of the most interesting of his works.
Obviously, in a duodecimo of some two hundred widely-printed pages,
it was impossible to keep the high-sounding promise of its title;
and at best its author's knowledge of the subject, notwithstanding
his continental wanderings, can have been but that of an external
spectator. Still in an age when critical utterance was more than
ordinarily full-wigged and ponderous, it dared to be sprightly and
epigrammatic. Some of its passages, besides, bear upon the writer's
personal experiences, and serve to piece the imperfections of his
biography. If it brought him no sudden wealth,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">it certainly raised his reputation with the
book- selling world. A connexion already begun with Smollett's
<cite>Critical Review</cite> was drawn closer; and the shrewd Sosii
of the Row began to see the importance of securing so vivacious and
unconventional a pen. Towards the end of the year he was writing
for Wilkie the collection of periodical essays entitled <cite>The
Bee</cite>; and contributing to the same publisher's <cite>Lady's
Magazine</cite>, as well as to <cite>The Busy Body</cite> of one
Pottinger. In these, more than ever, he was finding his distinctive
touch; and ratifying anew, with every fresh stroke of his pen, his
bondage to authorship as a calling.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He had still, however, to conquer the public.
<cite>The Bee</cite>, although it contains one of his most
characteristic essays ('A City Night-Piece'), and some of the most
popular of his lighter verses ('The Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize'),
never attained the circulation essential to healthy existence. It
closed with its eighth number in November, 1759. In the following
month two gentlemen called at Green Arbour Court to enlist the
services of its author. One was Smollett, with a new serial, <cite>
The British Magazine</cite>; the other was Johnson's 'Jack
Whirler,' bustling Mr. John Newbery from the 'Bible and Sun' in St.
Paul's Churchyard, with a new daily newspaper, <cite>The Public
Ledger</cite>. For Smollett, Goldsmith wrote the 'Reverie at the
Boar's Head Tavern' and the 'Adventures of a Strolling Player,'
besides a number of minor papers. For Newbery, by a happy
recollection of the <cite>Lettres Persanes</cite> of Montesquieu,
<u>or some of his imitators</u>, he struck almost at once into that
charming epistolary series, brimful of fine observation, kindly
satire, and various fancy, which was ultimately to become the
English classic known as <cite>The Citizen of the World</cite>. He
continued to produce these letters periodically until the August of
the following year, when they were</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">announced for republication in 'two volumes of
the usual <cite>Spectator</cite> size.' In this form they appeared
in May, 1762.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But long before this date a change for the
better had taken place in Goldsmith's life. Henceforth he was sure
of work,&mdash;mere journey- work though much of it must have
been;&mdash;and, had his nature been less improvident, of freedom
from absolute want. The humble lodgings in the Old Bailey were
discarded for new premises at No. 6 Wine Office Court, Fleet
Street; and here, on the 31st of May, 1761, with Percy, came one
whose name was often in the future to be associated with
Goldsmith's, the great Dictator of London literary society, Samuel
Johnson. Boswell, who made Johnson's acquaintance later, has not
recorded the humours of that supper; but it marks the beginning of
Goldsmith's friendship with the man who of all others (Reynolds
excepted) loved him most and understood him best.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">During the remainder of 1761 he continued busily
to ply his pen. Besides his contributions to <cite>The
Ledger</cite> and <cite>The British Magazine</cite>, he edited
<cite>The Lady's Magazine</cite>, inserting in it the <cite>Memoirs
of Voltaire</cite>, drawn up some time earlier to accompany a
translation of the <cite>Henriade</cite> by his crony and
compatriot Edward Purdon. Towards the beginning of 1762 he was hard
at work on several compilations for Newbery, for whom he wrote or
edited a <cite>History of Mecklenburgh</cite>, and a series of
monthly volumes of an abridgement of <cite>Plutarch's Lives</cite>.
In October of the same year was published the <cite>Life of Richard
Nash</cite>, apparently the outcome of special holiday-visits to
the then fashionable watering-place of Bath, whence its fantastic
old Master of the Ceremonies had only very lately made his final
exit. It is a pleasantly gossiping, and not unedifying little book,
which still holds a respectable place among its author's minor
works. But a recently discovered entry in an old ledger shows that
during the latter half</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page xix"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">of 1762 he must have planned, if he had not,
indeed, already in part composed, a far more important effort,
<cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>. For on the 28th of October in
this year he sold to one Benjamin Collins, printer, of Salisbury,
for 21 pounds, a third in a work with that title, further described
as '2 vols. 12mo.' How this little circumstance, discovered by Mr.
Charles Welsh when preparing his Life of John Newbery, is to be
brought into agreement with the time-honoured story, related (with
variations) by Boswell and others, to the effect that Johnson
negotiated the sale of the manuscript for Goldsmith when the latter
was arrested for rent by his incensed landlady&mdash;has not yet
been satisfactorily suggested. Possibly the solution is a simple
one, referable to some of those intricate arrangements favoured by
'the Trade' at a time when not one but half a score publishers'
names figured in an imprint. At present, the fact that Collins
bought a third share of the book from the author for twenty
guineas, and the statement that Johnson transferred the entire
manuscript to a bookseller for sixty pounds, seem irreconcilable.
That <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite> was nevertheless written,
or was being written, in 1762, is <u>demonstrable from internal
evidence</u>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">About Christmas in the same year Goldsmith moved
into lodgings at Islington, his landlady being one Mrs. Elizabeth
Fleming, a friend of Newbery, to whose generalship this step seems
attributable. From the curious accounts printed by Prior and
Forster, it is clear that the publisher was Mrs. Fleming's
paymaster, punctually deducting his disbursements from the account
current between himself and Goldsmith, an arrangement which as
plainly indicates the foresight of the one as it implies the
improvidence of the other. Of the work which Goldsmith did for the
businesslike and not unkindly little man, there is no very definite
evidence; but various prefaces,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">introductions, and the like, belong to this
time; and he undoubtedly was the author of the excellent <cite>
History of England in a Series of Letters addressed by a Nobleman
to his Son</cite>, published anonymously in June, 1764, and long
attributed, for the grace of its style, to Lyttelton, Chesterfield,
Orrery, and other patrician pens. Meanwhile his range of
acquaintance was growing larger. The establishment, at the
beginning of 1764, of the famous association known afterwards as
the 'Literary Club' brought him into intimate relations with
Beauclerk, Reynolds, Langton, Burke, and others. Hogarth, too, is
said to have visited him at Islington, and to have painted the
portrait of Mrs. Fleming. Later in the same year, incited thereto
by the success of Christopher Smart's <cite>Hannah</cite>, he wrote
the Oratorio of <cite>The Captivity</cite>, now to be found in most
editions of his poems, but never set to music. Then after the slow
growth of months, was issued on the 19th December the elaboration
of that fragmentary sketch which he had sent years before to his
brother Henry from the Continent, the poem entitled <cite>The
Traveller; or, A Prospect of Society</cite>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the notes appended to <cite>The
Traveller</cite> in the present volume, its origin and progress are
sufficiently explained. Its success was immediate and enduring. The
beauty of the descriptive passages, the subtle simplicity of the
language, the sweetness and finish of the versification, found
ready admirers,&mdash;perhaps all the more because of the contrast
they afforded to the rough and strenuous sounds with which Charles
Churchill had lately filled the public ear. Johnson, who
contributed a few lines at the close, proclaimed <cite>The
Traveller</cite> to be the best poem since the death of Pope; and
it is certainly not easy to find its equal among the works of
contemporary bards. It at once raised Goldsmith from the condition
of a clever newspaper essayist, or&mdash;as men like Sir John</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Hawkins would have said&mdash;a mere
'bookseller's drudge,' to the foremost rank among the poets of the
day. Another result of its success was the revival of some of his
earlier work, which, however neglected by the author, had been
freely appropriated by the discerning pirate. In June, 1765,
Griffin and Newbery published a little volume of <cite>Essays by
Mr. Goldsmith</cite>, including some of the best of his
contributions to <cite>The Bee, The Busy Body, The Public
Ledger</cite>, and <cite>The British Magazine</cite>, besides 'The
Double Transformation' and 'The Logicians Refuted,' two pieces of
verse in imitation of Prior and Swift, which have not been traced
to an earlier source. To the same year belongs the first version of
a poem which he himself regarded as his best work, and which still
retains something of its former popularity. This was the ballad of
<cite>Edwin and Angelina</cite>, otherwise known as <cite>The
Hermit</cite>. It originated in certain metrical discussions with
Percy, then engaged upon his famous <cite>Reliques of English
Poetry</cite>; and in 1765, Goldsmith, who through his friend
Nugent (afterwards Lord Clare) had made the acquaintance of the
Earl of Northumberland, printed it privately for the amusement of
the Countess. In a revised and amended form it was subsequently

<p align="JUSTIFY">With the exception of an abortive attempt to
resume his practice as a medical man,&mdash;an attempt which seems
to have been frustrated by the preternatural strength of his
prescriptions,&mdash;the next memorable thing in Goldsmith's life
is the publication of <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite> itself.
It made its appearance on the 27th of March, 1766. A second edition
followed in May, a third in August. Why, having been sold (in part)
to a Salisbury printer as far back as October, 1762, it had
remained unprinted so long; and why, when published, it was
published by Francis Newbery and not by John Newbery,
Goldsmith's</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">employer,&mdash;are questions at present
unsolved. But the charm of this famous novel is as fresh as when it
was first issued. Its inimitable types, its happy mingling of
Christianity and character, its wholesome benevolence and its
practical wisdom, are still unimpaired. We smile at the
inconsistencies of the plot; but we are carried onward in spite of
them, captivated by the grace, the kindliness, the gentle humour of
the story. Yet it is a mistake to suppose that its success was
instantaneous. Pirated it was, of course; but, according to expert
investigations, the authorized edition brought so little gain to
its first proprietors that the fourth issue of 1770 <u>started with
a loss</u>. The fifth, published in April, 1774, was dated 1773;
and had apparently been withheld because the previous edition,
which consisted of no more than one thousand copies, was not
exhausted. Five years elapsed before the sixth edition made its
tardy appearance in 1779. These facts show that the writer's
contemporaries were not his most eager readers. But he has long
since appealed to the wider audience of posterity; and his fame is
not confined to his native country, for he has been translated into
most European languages. Dr. Primrose and his family are now
veritable 'citizens of the world.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A selection of <cite>Poems for Young
Ladies</cite>, in the 'Moral' division of which he included his own
<cite>Edwin and Angelina</cite>; two volumes of <cite>Beauties of
English Poesy</cite>, disfigured with strange heedlessness, by a
couple of the most objectionable pieces of Prior; a translation of
a French history of philosophy, and other occasional work, followed
the publication of the <cite>Vicar</cite>. But towards the middle
of 1766, he was meditating a new experiment in that line in which
Farquhar, Steele, Southerne, and others of his countrymen had
succeeded before him. A fervent lover of the stage, he detested the
vapid and colourless 'genteel'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">comedy which had gradually gained ground in
England; and he determined to follow up <cite>The Clandestine
Marriage</cite>, then recently adapted by Colman and Garrick from
Hogarth's <cite>Marriage A-la-Mode</cite>, with another effort of
the same class, depending exclusively for its interest upon humour
and character. Early in 1767 it was completed, and submitted to
Garrick for Drury Lane. But Garrick perhaps too politic to traverse
the popular taste, temporized; and eventually after many delays and
disappointments, <cite>The Good Natur'd Man</cite>, as it was
called, was produced at Covent Garden by Colman on the 29th of
January, 1768. Its success was only partial; and in deference to
the prevailing craze for the 'genteel,' an admirable scene of low
humour had to be omitted in the representation. But the piece,
notwithstanding, brought the author 400 pounds, to which the sale
of the book, with the condemned passages restored, added another
100 pounds. Furthermore, Johnson, whose 'Suspirius' in <cite>The
Rambler</cite> was, under the name of 'Croaker,' one of its most
prominent personages, pronounced it to be the best comedy since
Cibber's <cite>Provok'd Husband</cite>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">During the autumn of 1767, Goldsmith had again
been living at Islington. On this occasion he had a room in
Canonbury Tower, Queen Elizabeth's old hunting-lodge, and perhaps
occupied the very chamber generally used by John Newbery, whose
active life was, in this year, to close. When in London he had
modest housing in the Temple. But the acquisition of 500 pounds for
<cite>The Good Natur'd Man</cite> seemed to warrant a change of
residence, and he accordingly expended four-fifths of that sum for
the lease of three rooms on the second floor of No. 2 Brick Court,
which he straightway proceeded to decorate sumptuously with
mirrors, Wilton carpets, moreen curtains, and Pembroke tables. It
was an unfortunate step; and he would have done well to remember
the <i>Nil</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>te quaesiveris extra</i> with which his
inflexible monitor, Johnson, had greeted his apologies for the
shortcomings of some earlier lodgings. One of its natural results
was to involve him in a new sequence of task-work, from which he
never afterwards shook himself free. Hence, following hard upon a
<cite>Roman History</cite> which he had already engaged to write
for Davies of Russell Street, came a more ambitious project for
Griffin, <cite>A History of Animated Nature</cite>; and after this
again, another <cite>History of England</cite> for Davies. The pay
was not inadequate; for the first he was to have 250 guineas, for
the second 800 guineas, and for the last 500 pounds. But as
employment for the author of a unique novel, an excellent comedy,
and a deservedly successful poem, it was surely&mdash;in his own
words&mdash;'to cut blocks with a razor.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">And yet, apart from the anxieties of growing
money troubles, his life could not have been wholly unhappy. There
are records of pleasant occasional junketings&mdash;'shoe-maker's
holidays' he called them&mdash;in the still countrified suburbs of
Hampstead and Edgware; there was the gathering at the Turk's Head,
with its literary magnates, for his severer hours; and for his more
pliant moments, the genial 'free-and-easy' or shilling whist-club
of a less pretentious kind, where the student of mixed character
might shine with something of the old supremacy of George Conway's
inn at Ballymahon. And there must have been quieter and more
chastened resting-places of memory, when, softening towards the
home of his youth, with a sadness made more poignant by the death
of his brother Henry in May, 1768, he planned and perfected his new
poem of <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In December, 1769, the recent appointment of his
friend Reynolds as President of the Royal Academy brought him the
honorary office of Professor of History to that</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">institution; and to Reynolds <cite>The Deserted
Village</cite> was dedicated. It appeared on the 26th of May, 1770,
with a success equal, if not superior, to that of <cite>The
Traveller</cite>. It ran through five editions in the year of its
publication; and has ever since retained its reputation. If, as
alleged, contemporary critics ranked it below its predecessor, the
reason advanced by Washington Irving, that the poet had become his
own rival, is doubtless correct; and there is always a prejudice in
favour of the first success. This, however, is not an obstacle
which need disturb the reader now; and he will probably decide that
in grace and tenderness of description <cite>The Deserted
Village</cite> in no wise falls short of <cite>The
Traveller</cite>; and that its central idea, and its sympathy with
humanity, give it a higher value as a work of art.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">After <cite>The Deserted Village</cite> had
appeared, Goldsmith made a short trip to Paris, in company with
Mrs. and the two Miss Hornecks, the elder of whom, christened by
the poet with the pretty pet-name of 'The Jessamy Bride,' is
supposed to have inspired him with more than friendly feelings.
Upon his return he had to fall again to the old 'book-building' in
order to recruit his exhausted finances. Since his last poem he had
published a short <cite>Life of Parnell</cite>; and Davies now
engaged him on a <cite>Life of Bolingbroke</cite>, and an
abridgement of the <cite>Roman History</cite>. Thus, with visits to
friends, among others to Lord Clare, for whom he wrote the
delightful occasional verses called <cite>The Haunch of
Venison</cite>, the months wore on until, in December, 1770, the
print-shops began to be full of the well-known mezzotint which
Marchi had engraved from his portrait by Sir Joshua.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">His chief publications in the next two years
were the above- mentioned <cite>History of England</cite>, 1771;
<cite>Threnodia Augustalis</cite>, a poetical lament-to-order on
the death of the Princess Dowager of Wales, 1772; and the
abridgement</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">of the <cite>Roman History</cite>, 1772. But in
the former year he had completed a new comedy, <cite>She Stoops to
Conquer; or, The Mistakes of a Night</cite>, which, after the usual
vexatious negotiations, was brought out by Colman at Covent Garden
on Monday, the 15th of March, 1773. The manager seems to have acted
Goldsmith's own creation of 'Croaker' with regard to this piece,
and even to the last moment predicted its failure. But it was a
brilliant success. More skilful in construction than <cite>The Good
Natur'd Man</cite>, more various in its contrasts of character,
richer and stronger in humour and <i>vis comica</i>, <cite>She
Stoops to Conquer</cite> has continued to provide an inexhaustible
fund of laughter to more than three generations of playgoers, and
still bids fair to retain the character generally given to it, of
being one of the three most popular comedies upon the English
stage. When published, it was gratefully inscribed, in one of those
admirable dedications of which its author above all men possessed
the secret, to Johnson, who had befriended it from the first. 'I do
not mean,' wrote Goldsmith, 'so much to compliment you as myself.
It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived
many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the interests of
mankind also to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in
a character, without impairing the most unaffected piety.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">His gains from <cite>She Stoops to
Conquer</cite> were considerable; but by this time his affairs had
reached a stage of complication which nothing short of a miracle
could disentangle; and there is reason for supposing that his
involved circumstances preyed upon his mind. During the few months
of life that remained to him he published nothing, being doubtless
sufficiently occupied by the undertakings to which he was already
committed. The last of his poetical efforts was the poem
entitled</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><cite>Retaliation</cite>, a group of epitaph-
epigrams prompted by some similar <i>jeux d'esprit</i> directed
against himself by Garrick and other friends, and left incomplete
at his death. In March, 1774, the combined effects of work and
worry, added to a local disorder, brought on a nervous fever, which
he unhappily aggravated by the use of a patent medicine called <u>
'James's Powder.'</u> He had often relied upon this before, but in
the present instance it was unsuited to his complaint. On Monday,
the 4th of April, 1774, he died, in his forty-sixth year, and was
buried on the 9th in the burying-ground of the Temple Church. Two
years later a monument, with a medallion portrait by Nollekens, and
a Latin inscription by Johnson, was erected to him in Westminster
Abbey, at the expense of the Literary Club. But although the
inscription contains more than one phrase of felicitous
discrimination, notably the oft-quoted <i>affectuum potens, at
lenis dominator</i>, it may be doubted whether the simpler words
used by his rugged old friend in a letter to Langton are not a
fitter farewell to Oliver Goldsmith,&mdash;'Let not his frailties
be remembered; he was a very great man.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In person Goldsmith was short and strongly
built. His complexion was rather fair, but he was deeply scarred
with small- pox; and&mdash;if we may believe his own
account&mdash;the vicissitudes and privations of his early life had
not tended to diminish his initial disadvantages. 'You scarcely can
conceive,' he writes to his brother in 1759, 'how much eight years
of disappointment, anguish, and study, have worn me down. . . .
Imagine to yourself a pale melancholy visage, with two great
wrinkles between the eye-brows, with an eye disgustingly severe,
and a big wig; and you may have a perfect picture of my present
appearance,' i.e. at thirty years of age. 'I can neither laugh nor
drink,' he goes on; 'have contracted an hesitating, disagreeable
manner of speaking, and a visage</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">that looks ill-nature itself; in short, I have
thought myself into a settled melancholy, and an utter disgust of
all that life brings with it.' It is obvious that this description
is largely coloured by passing depression. 'His features,' says one
contemporary, 'were plain, but not repulsive,&mdash;certainly not
so when lighted up by conversation.' Another witness&mdash;the
'Jessamy Bride'&mdash;declares that 'his benevolence was
unquestionable, and his countenance bore every trace of it.' His
true likeness would seem to lie midway between the grotesquely
truthful sketch by Bunbury prefixed in 1776 to the <cite>Haunch of
Venison</cite>, and the portrait idealized by personal regard,
which Reynolds painted in 1770. In this latter he is shown wearing,
in place of his customary wig, his own scant brown hair, and, on
this occasion, masquerades in a furred robe, and falling collar.
But even through the disguise of a studio 'costume,' the
finely-perceptive genius of Reynolds has managed to suggest much
that is most appealing in his sitter's nature. Past suffering,
present endurance, the craving to be understood, the mute
deprecation of contempt, are all written legibly in this pathetic
picture. It has been frequently copied, often very ineffectively,
for so subtle is the art that the slightest deviation hopelessly
distorts and vulgarizes what Reynolds has done supremely, once and
for ever.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Goldsmith's character presents but few real
complexities. What seems most to have impressed his contemporaries
is the difference, emphasized by the happily-antithetic epigram of
Garrick, between his written style and his conversation; and
collaterally, between his eminence as a literary man and his
personal insignificance. Much of this is easily intelligible. He
had started in life with few temporal or physical advantages, and
with a native susceptibility that intensified his defects.
Until</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page xxix"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">he became a middle-aged man, he led a life of
which we do not even now know all the degradations; and these had
left their mark upon his manners. With the publication of <cite>The
Traveller</cite>, he became at once the associate of some of the
best talent and intellect in England,&mdash;of fine gentlemen such
as Beauclerk and Langton, of artists such as Reynolds and Garrick,
of talkers such as Johnson and Burke. Morbidly self-conscious,
nervously anxious to succeed, he was at once forced into a
competition for which neither his antecedents nor his
qualifications had prepared him. To this, coupled with the old
habit of poverty, must be attributed his oft-cited passion for fine
clothes, which surely arose less from vanity than from a mistaken
attempt to extenuate what he felt to be his most obvious
shortcomings. As a talker especially he was ill-fitted to shine. He
was easily disconcerted by retort, and often discomfited in
argument. To the end of his days he never lost his native brogue;
and (as he himself tells us) he had that most fatal of defects to a
narrator, a slow and hesitating manner. The perspicuity which makes
the charm of his writings deserted him in conversation; and his
best things were momentary flashes. But some of these were
undoubtedly very happy. His telling Johnson that he would make the
little fishes talk like whales; his affirmation of Burke that he
wound into a subject like a serpent; and half-a-dozen other
well-remembered examples&mdash;afford ample proof of this.
Something of the uneasy jealousy he is said to have exhibited with
regard to certain of his contemporaries may also be connected with
the long probation of obscurity during which he had been a
spectator of the good fortune of others, to whom he must have known
himself superior. His improvidence seems to have been congenital,
since it is to be traced 'even from his boyish days.' But though it
cannot justly be ascribed to any</p>

<hr>

xxx</i></font></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">reaction from want to sufficiency, it can still
less be supposed to have been diminished by that change. If he was
careless of money, it must also be remembered that he gave much of
it away; and fortune lingers little with those whose ears are
always open to a plausible tale of distress. Of his sensibility and
genuine kindheartedness there is no doubt. And it is well to
remember that most of the tales to his disadvantage come, not from
his more distinguished companions, but from such admitted
detractors as Hawkins and Boswell. It could be no mean
individuality that acquired the esteem, and deserved the regret, of
Johnson and Reynolds.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In an edition of Goldsmith's poems, any extended
examination of his remaining productions would be out of place.
Moreover, the bulk of these is considerably reduced when all that
may properly be classed as hack-work has been withdrawn. The
histories of Greece, of Rome, and of England; the <cite>Animated
Nature</cite>; the lives of Nash, Voltaire, Parnell, and
Bolingbroke, are merely compilations, only raised to the highest
level in that line because they proceeded from a man whose gift of
clear and easy exposition lent a charm to everything he touched.
With the work which he did for himself, the case is different. Into
<cite>The Citizen of the World</cite>, <cite>The Vicar of
Wakefield</cite>, and his two comedies, he put all the best of his
knowledge of human nature, his keen sympathy with his kind, his
fine common-sense and his genial humour. The same qualities,
tempered by a certain grace and tenderness, also enter into the
best of his poems. Avoiding the epigram of Pope and the austere
couplet of Johnson, he yet borrowed something from each, which he
combined with a delicacy and an amenity that he had learned from
neither. He himself, in all probability, would have rested his fame
on his three chief metrical efforts, <cite>The Traveller</cite>,
<cite>The Hermit</cite>, and <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>.
But,</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page xxxi"><font color="#000000"><i>page
xxxi</i></font></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">as is often the case, he is remembered even more
favourably by some of those delightful familiar verses, unprinted
during his lifetime, which he threw off with no other ambition than
the desire to amuse his friends. <cite>Retaliation</cite>, <cite>
The Haunch of Venison</cite>, the <cite>Letter in Prose and Verse
to Mrs. Bunbury</cite>, all afford noteworthy exemplification of
that playful touch and wayward fancy which constitute the chief
attraction of this species of poetry. In his imitations of Swift
and Prior, and his variations upon French suggestions, his personal
note is scarcely so apparent; but the two Elegies and some of the
minor pieces retain a deserved reputation. His ingenious prologues
and epilogues also serve to illustrate the range and versatility of
his talent. As a rule, the arrangement in the present edition is
chronological; but it has not been thought necessary to depart from
the practice which gives a time- honoured precedence to <cite>The
Traveller</cite> and <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>. The true
sequence of the poems, in their order of publication, is, however,
exactly indicated in the table which follows this Introduction.</p>
