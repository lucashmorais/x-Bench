<h1>
Peter's Second Letter
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Simon Peter, a servant and
apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith
with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Grace to you and peace be
multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> seeing that his divine power has
granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> by which he has granted to us his
precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is
in the world by lust.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Yes,
and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith
supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> and in knowledge, self-control;
and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> and in godliness brotherly
affection; and in brotherly affection, love.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> For if these things are yours and
abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> For
he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having
forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Therefore, <a
href="#N1">brothers,</a> be more diligent to make your calling and
election sure. For if you do these things, you will never stumble.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> For thus you will be richly
supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Therefore I will not
be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are
established in the present truth.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> I think it right, as long as I am
in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> knowing that the putting off of
my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Yes, I will make every
effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my
departure.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> For we did not
follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
 <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> For he received from God
the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic
Glory, &quot;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> We heard this voice come out of
heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
<p> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> We have the more sure
word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining
in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your
hearts:  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> knowing this
first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> For no prophecy ever came by the
will of man: but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> But false prophets also
arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will
secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought
them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Many will follow their <a
href="#N3">immoral</a> ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be
maligned.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> In covetousness
they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old
doesn't linger, and their destruction will not slumber.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> For if God didn't spare angels
when they sinned, but cast them down to <a href="#N4">Tartarus</a>, and
committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> and didn't spare the ancient
world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness,
when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> and turning the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them
an example to those who would live ungodly;  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> and delivered righteous Lot, who
was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> (for that righteous man dwelling
among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with
seeing and hearing lawless deeds):  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> the Lord knows how to deliver the
godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for
the day of judgment;  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> but
chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and
despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil
of dignitaries;  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> whereas
angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring a railing judgment
against them before the Lord.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> But these, as unreasoning
creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil
in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely
be destroyed,  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> receiving
the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the
daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast
with you;  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> having eyes
full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls;
having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> forsaking the right way, they
went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved
the wages of wrong-doing;  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> but he was rebuked for his own
disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the
madness of the prophet.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> These are wells without water,
clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been
reserved forever.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> For,
uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of
the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who
live in error;  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> promising
them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a
man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.
<p> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> For if, after they
have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the
last state has become worse for them than the first.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> For it would be better for them
not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to
turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> But it has happened to them
according to the true proverb, &quot;The dog turns to his own vomit
again,&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N5">*</a></sup></font> and &quot;the sow that has washed to
wallowing in the mire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> This is now, beloved,
the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir
up your sincere mind by reminding you;  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> that you should remember the words
which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us,
the apostles of the Lord and Savior:  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> knowing this first, that in the
last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> and saying, &quot;Where is the
promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all
things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.&quot;
 <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> For this they willfully
forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of
water and amid water, by the word of God;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> by which means the world that then
was, being overflowed with water, perished.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> But the heavens that now are, and
the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved
against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> But don't forget this one thing,
beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand
years as one day.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> The Lord
is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient
with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to
repentance.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> But the day
of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will
pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with
fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned
up.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Therefore since all
these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to
be in holy living and godliness,  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> looking for and earnestly
desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning
heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
 <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> But, according to his
promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness
dwells.
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Therefore, beloved,
seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace,
without blemish and blameless in his sight.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Regard the patience of our Lord
as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the
wisdom given to him, wrote to you;  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> as also in all of his letters,
speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are
hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also
do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> You therefore, beloved, knowing
these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of
the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> But grow in the grace and
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both
now and forever. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
