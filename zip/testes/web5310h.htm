<h1>
Paul's Second Letter to the Thessalonians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, Silvanus, and
Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Grace
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> We are bound to always
give thanks to God for you, <a href="#N1">brothers,</a> even as it is
appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each
and every one of you towards one another abounds;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> so that we ourselves boast about
you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your
persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> This is an obvious sign of the
righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of
the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Since it is a righteous thing with
God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> and to give relief to you who are
afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his
mighty angels in flaming fire,  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> giving vengeance to those who
don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Good News of our Lord
Jesus,  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> who will pay the
penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory
of his might,  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> when he
comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who
have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
<p> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> To this end we also
pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling,
and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;
 <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> that the name of our Lord
Jesus<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now, brothers,
concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together
to him, we ask you  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> not to
be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or
by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.
 <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Let no one deceive you in
any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man
of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> he who opposes and exalts himself
against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as
God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Don't you remember that, when I
was still with you, I told you these things?  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Now you know what is restraining
him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> For the mystery of lawlessness
already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out
of the way.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Then the
lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of
his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> even he whose coming is according
to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> and with all deception of
wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn't receive the
love of the truth, that they might be saved.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Because of this, God sends them a
working of error, that they should believe a lie;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> that they all might be judged who
didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> But we are bound to always give
thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you
from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and
belief in the truth;  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> to
which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory
of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> So then, brothers, stand firm,
and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or
by letter.
<p> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Now our Lord Jesus
Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal
comfort and good hope through grace,  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> comfort your hearts and establish
you in every good work and word.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Finally, brothers, pray
for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified,
even as also with you;  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> and
that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have
faith.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> But the Lord is
faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> We have confidence in the Lord
concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.
 <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> May the Lord direct your
hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
<p> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Now we command you,
brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw
yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the
tradition which they received from us.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> For you know how you ought to
imitate us. For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you,  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> neither did we eat bread from
anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night
and day, that we might not burden any of you;  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> not because we don't have the
right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate
us.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> For even when we were
with you, we commanded you this: &quot;If anyone will not work, neither
let him eat.&quot;  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> For we
hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't work at all, but
are busybodies.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Now those
who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that
with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> But you, brothers,
don't be weary in doing well.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> If any man doesn't obey our word
in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the
end that he may be ashamed.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Don't count him as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother.
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Now may the Lord of
peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with
you all.
<p> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> The greeting of me,
Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I
write.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> The grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web5310h.htm or web5310h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web5311h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web5310ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
