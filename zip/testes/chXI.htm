<p><b>SEASONAL REMINDERS</b></p>

<p>The author assumes that a person who is intelligent enough to make a
garden, does not need an arbitrary calendar of operations. Too exact
advice is misleading and unpractical. Most of the older gardening books
were arranged wholly on the calendar method--giving specific directions
for each month in the year. We have now accumulated sufficient fact and
experience, however, to enable us to state principles; and these
principles can be applied anywhere,--when supplemented by good
judgment,--whereas mere rules are arbitrary and generally useless for
any other condition than that for which they were specifically made. The
regions of gardening experience have expanded enormously within the past
fifty and seventy-five years. Seasons and conditions vary so much in
different years and different places that no hard and fast advice can be
given for the performing of gardening operations, yet brief hints for
the proper work of the various months may be useful as suggestions and
reminders.</p>

<p>The Monthly Reminders are compiled from files of the &quot;American Garden&quot;
of some years back, when the author had editorial charge of that
magazine. The advice for the North (pages 504 to 516) was written by T.
Greiner, La Salle, N.Y. well known as a gardener and author. That for
the South (pages 516 to 526) was made by H.W. Smith, Baton Rouge, La.,
for the first nine months, and it was extended for &quot;Garden-Making&quot; to
the months of October, November, and December by F.H. Burnette,
Horticulturist of the Louisiana Experiment Station.</p>

<p><b>KITCHEN-GARDEN PLANTING TABLE</b></p>

<p>A GUIDE TO THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING OF VARIOUS SEEDS IN ORDER TO
OBTAIN CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION OF CROPS</p>

<p><b>Explanation of Signs Used In the Table.</b></p>

<p>(0)To be sown in open ground without transplanting. Plants have to be
thinned out, given proper distance.</p>

<p>(1) Sow in seed bed in the garden, and transplant thence to permanent
place.</p>

<p>(2) Make two sowings in open ground during the month.</p>

<p>(3) Make three sowings in open ground during the month.</p>

<p>(4) Start in greenhouse or hot-bed, and plant out so soon as the ground
is in good shape, and weather permits.</p>

<p>(5) Sow in open ground as soon as it can be worked.</p>

<p>(6) To be grown only in hot-bed or greenhouse.</p>

<p>(7) Sow in cold frame, keep plants there over winter with a little
protection; plant out in spring as soon as the ground can be worked.</p>

<p>(8) To be sown in open ground, and protected with litter over winter.</p>

<p>(9) Plant in frame. When cold weather sets in, cover with sash and straw
mats. Plants will be ready for use in December and January.</p>

<p>(10) Plant in cellar, barn or under benches in greenhouse.</p>

<p>(11) Plant outdoors on prepared beds.</p>

<p>(12) Sow every week in greenhouse or frame, to have a good succession.</p>

<p><!-- Page 541 --><b>SUGGESTIONS AND REMINDERS.--I. FOR THE NORTH</b></p>
<br>

<p><b>JANUARY</b></p>

<p><i>Cabbage plants</i> in frames need free airing whenever the temperature
is above the freezing point, or so long as the soil of the bed is not
frozen. Snow, in that case, should be removed soon after its fall.
As long as the soil is frozen the snow can safely be left on for a number
of days. Cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce seed should be sown at
intervals to secure plants for extra-early sales or setting. A month
later they will be ready to transfer to boxes, which should go to the
coldframe and be given protection by mats or shutters.</p>

<p><i>Coldframes</i> must be well ventilated on warm, sunny days; leave
the sashes off as long as is possible without injury to the plants. Keep
the soil in a friable condition, and look carefully to any possible places
where water can stand and freeze. If the frames seem too cold, bank
up around them with coarse manure.</p>

<p><i>Hotbeds</i>.--Look up and repair the sashes. Save the horse-manure
from day to day, rejecting dry litter, and piling up the droppings and
urine-soaked bedding in thin layers to prevent violent heating.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i> in frames treat as advised for cabbage plants.</p>

<p><i>Pruning</i> should now be considered. Perhaps it is best to prune
fruit-trees in March or April, but grapes and currants and gooseberries
may be pruned now. January and February are good months in which
to prune peach trees. Thin out the peach trees well, taking care to
remove all the dead wood. If you have much pruning to do in apple,
pear, or plum orchards, you will save time by utilizing the warm days
now. Study well the different methods of pruning. Never let an
itinerant pruner touch your trees until you are satisfied that he understands
his business.</p>

<p><i>Tools</i> should now be inspected and repaired, and any new ones that
are needed made or ordered.</p>
<br>

<p><b>FEBRUARY</b></p>

<p><i>Cabbage</i>.--Sow seed of Jersey Wakefield in flats filled with light
loamy soil, the last week of this month. Sow thinly, cover lightly,
and place the boxes in a gentle hotbed or any warm, sunny situation.
When the plants are strong, transplant them into flats 1-1/2 in. apart
<!-- Page 542 -->each way. As growth begins, gradually expose them to the open air
on all favorable occasions. Late in March remove them to a coldframe,
and properly harden them off before setting them in the open
ground.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>.--We urgently advise every one who has a garden, large
or small, to make a trial of the new celery-culture. You need, first,
good plants. Get some seed of White Plume or Golden Self-blanching,
and sow it thickly in flats filled with fine loam. Cover by sifting
a thin layer of sand or fine soil over it, and firm well. Keep in a moderately
warm place, watering as needed, until plants appear. If you
have a number of flats, they may be placed on top of one another.
At the first sign of plant-growth, bring the flats gradually to the light.
When the plants are 1-1/2 or 2 in. high, transplant them into other flats,
setting them in rows 2-1/2 in. apart, the plants half an inch apart in
the rows. Then set the flats in a coldframe until the plants are large
enough to plant out in the open ground.</p>

<p><i>Hotbeds</i> for raising early plants should be made this month. Always
break the manure up fine and tread it down well. Be sure to put
enough in the center of beds, so that there will be no sagging. Fresh
manure of hard-worked and well-fed horses, free from dry litter, is
best. An addition of leaves used for bedding will serve to produce
a more moderate but more lasting heat. Sheep-manure may also
be added to the horse-manure, should there be a scant supply of the
latter on hand.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--We urgently advise giving the new onion-culture a trial.
For seed, buy a packet or an ounce of Prizetaker, Spanish King, White
Victoria, or some other large kind of globe onion. Sow the seed in
flats, in a hotbed, or in a greenhouse late in the month, and transplant
the onions to the open ground as soon as the latter is in working
condition. Set the plants in rows 1 ft. apart and about 3 in. apart
in the row.</p>

<p><i>Plums</i>.--Make a thorough inspection of all plum and cherry trees,
wild and cultivated, for plum-knot. Cut and burn all the knots found.
Remove all &quot;mummy&quot; plums, for they spread the fruit-rot.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb</i>.--Give the plants in the garden a heavy dressing of fine
old compost. If you wish a few early stalks, place kegs or boxes over
some of the plants, and heap over them some heating horse-manure.</p>
<br>

<p><!-- Page 543 --><b>MARCH</b></p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--A few seeds may be sown in the hotbed.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage, cauliflower, and celery</i> seeds may be sown for the early crop.</p>

<p><i>Egg-plants.</i>--Seeds should be sown. Take care that the young
plants are never stunted.</p>

<p><i>Grafting</i> may be done in favorable weather. Cherries and plums
must be grafted early. Use liquid grafting-wax in cold weather.</p>

<p><i>Hotbeds</i> may be made at any time, but do not grow impatient about
the work, for there will be cold weather yet. Clean, fresh manure is
necessary, and a layer 2 ft. thick should be tramped hard. When
once started and the seeds sown, do not let the beds get too hot. Give
them air on fine days and give the seedlings plenty of water. Use two
thermometers--one to test the atmosphere and the other the heat
of the soil.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i> should be sown in the hotbed for an early crop.</p>

<p><i>Onion</i> seed for the new onion-culture may be sown at the close of
the month.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>.--Sow now, if the ground can be worked.</p>

<p><i>Peppers</i> may be sown late in the month.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes</i> kept for seed must not be allowed to sprout. Keep them
in a temperature near freezing point. Rub off the sprouts from
potatoes kept for eating, and pick out all decayed specimens.</p>

<p><i>Spinach</i>.--Sow some seeds for an early crop.</p>

<p><i>Tomato</i> seeds may be sown in the hotbeds.</p>
<br>

<p><b>APRIL</b></p>

<p><i>Artichokes</i>.--Sow the seeds for next year's crop. A deep, rich,
sandy loam is best. Fork in a dressing of well-rotted manure around
the old plants.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>.--Spade in some good manure in the bed, and give
the soil a thorough working before the crowns start. Sow seeds in the
open ground for young plants for a new bed.</p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Limas may be started on sods in a hotbed or a coldframe
towards the last of the month.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--The ground should be prepared and the seed sown for
beets for cattle as soon as the weather will permit. Put them in before
<!-- Page 544 -->planting corn. They will stand considerable cold weather, and should
be planted early to get a start of the weeds.</p>

<p><i>Blackberries</i> should be pruned, the brush drawn off, piled, and
burned. If it is necessary, to stake them, try a wire trellis, the same
as for grapes, putting on one wire 2-1/2 ft. high. The young plants should
be dug before the buds start.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage</i> seed may be sown in the open ground, in coldframes, or
in pans or boxes in the house. Early varieties should be started at
once. Cabbages like a rich and heavy loam, with good drainage. Give
them all the manure you can get.</p>

<p><i>Cauliflower</i> seeds may be sown toward the last of the month. They
should never have a check from the time the seed is sown until harvested.</p>

<p><i>Carrot</i>.--Sow the seed of early sorts, like Early Forcing, as soon
as the ground can be worked.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>.--Plan to grow celery by the new method. Plenty of
manure and moisture are required to do this. Sow the seed in light,
rich soil in the house, hotbed, coldframe, or open ground. Transplant
the plants once before setting them in the field. Page 505.</p>

<p><i>Cress</i>.--Sow early and every two or three weeks. Watercress
should be sown in damp soil or in streams. The outer edges of a hotbed
may also be utilized. Cress is often a profitable crop when rightly
handled.</p>

<p><i>Cucumber</i> seeds may be sown on sods in the hotbed.</p>

<p><i>Egg-plant.</i>--Sow in the hotbed, and transplant when 2 in. high to
other beds or pots. They must have good care, for a check in their
growth means all the difference between profit and loss.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Sow the seeds in the hotbed, and in the open ground as
soon as it can be worked. Plants sown a month ago should be transplanted.</p>

<p><i>Leek</i>.--Sow the seeds in the open ground in drills 6 in. apart and
1 in. deep, and when large enough, thin to 1 in. in the row.</p>

<p><i>Muskmelon</i>.--Plant seeds in sods in the hotbed.</p>

<p><i>Parsnip</i>.--Dig the roots before they grow and become soft and
pithy. Seeds may be sown as soon as the ground is dry enough to
work.</p>

<p><i>Parsley</i>.--Soak the seeds in warm water for a few hours, and sow
in the open ground.</p>

<p><!-- Page 545 --><i>Peas</i>.--Sow the seeds as soon as the ground can be worked. They
will stand considerable cold and transplanting also. Time may be
gained by sowing some seeds in moist sand in a box in the cellar and
transplanting when well sprouted. Plant deep in light, dry soil; cover
an inch at first, and draw in the earth as the vines grow.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes</i>.--Plant early on rich soil free from blight and scab. For
a very early crop, the potatoes may be sprouted before planting.</p>

<p><i>Peppers</i>.--Sow the seeds in the hotbed or in the boxes in the house.</p>

<p><i>Radish</i> seeds may be sown in the open ground or in the hotbed and
the crop harvested from there. The small, round varieties are best
for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Give a good, thorough cultivation between the rows
and then remove the mulch from the plants, placing it in the rows,
where it will help to keep the weeds down.</p>

<p><i>Salsify</i>.--Sow the seeds as soon as the ground can be worked.
Give the same care and cultivation as for carrots or parsnips.</p>

<p><i>Spinach</i> seeds must be sown early, and then every two weeks for
a succession. Thin out and use the plants before they send up flower-stalks.</p>

<p><i>Squashes</i>.--Hubbards and summer squashes may be started on
sods in the hotbed.</p>

<p><i>Tomato</i>.--Sow in the hotbed or in shallow boxes in the house.
Try some of the yellow varieties; they are the finest flavored of any.</p>

<p><b>MAY</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--The bush sorts may be planted in the open ground,
and limas in pots or sods in a coldframe or spent hotbed. Limas require
a long season to mature, and should be started early.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--Sow for a succession. Transplant those started under
glass.</p>

<p><i>Cabbages</i> always do best on a freshly turned sod, and should be
set before the land has had time to dry after plowing. The secret of
success in getting a large yield of cabbage is to start with rich land
and put on all the manure obtainable. Clean out the hog yard for
this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--Sow in the open ground toward the last of the month.
A few may be started as advised for lima beans.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Sow for a succession, and thin to 4 in. in the rows.</p>
<!-- Page 546 -->
<p><i>Melons</i>.--Plant in the open ground toward the end of the month.
It is useless to plant melons and other cucurbitaceous plants until
settled weather has arrived.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--Finish planting and transplanting, and keep all weeds
down, both in the seed-bed and the open field.</p>

<p>Peas.--Sow for a succession.</p>

<p><i>Squashes</i>.--Plant as advised for melons and cucumbers. They
require a rich, well-manured soil.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Remove the blossoms from newly set plants.
Mulch with salt hay or marsh hay or clean straw or leaves those that
are to bear. Mulching conserves moisture, keeps the berries clean,
and prevents weeds from growing.</p>

<p><i>Sweet corn</i>.--Plant early and late varieties, and by making two
or three plantings of each, at intervals, a succession may be kept up
all summer and fall. Sweet corn is delicious, and one can hardly have
too much of it.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--Set some early plants by the middle of the month
or earner, if the ground is warm, and the season early and fair. They
may be protected from the cold by covering with hay, straw, cloth, or
paper, or even with earth. The main crop should not be set until the
20th or 25th, or until all danger of frost is over. However, tomatoes
will stand more chilly weather than is ordinarily supposed.</p>
<br>

<p><b>JUNE</b></p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>.--Cease cutting and allow the shoots to grow. Keep
the weeds down and the soil well stirred. An application of a quick
commercial fertilizer or of liquid manure will be beneficial.</p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Sow the wax sorts for succession. As soon as a crop is
off, pull out the vines and plant the ground to late cabbage, turnips,
or sweet corn.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--Transplant in rows 1 to 3 ft. apart and 6 in. in the row.
Cut off most of the top, water thoroughly, and they will soon start.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage and cauliflower</i>.--Set plants for the late crop. Rich,
newly turned sod and a heavy dressing of well-rotted manure go a long
way toward assuring a good crop.</p>

<p><!-- Page 547 --><i>Celery</i>.--Set the main crop, and try the new method of setting the
plants 7 in. apart each way, if you have rich land and can irrigate,
but not unless these conditions are present. Page 505.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i> may yet be planted, if done early in the month.</p>

<p><i>Currants</i>.--Spray with Paris green for the currant worm until
the fruit sets. Hellebore is good, but it is difficult to get it of good
strength; use it for all late spraying.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Sow for succession in a moist, cool, and partially shaded
spot. The seed does not germinate well in hot weather.</p>

<p><i>Lima beans</i> should be hoed frequently, and started on the poles if
they are contrary.</p>

<p><i>Melons</i>.--Cultivate often and watch for the bugs. A screen of
closely woven wire or mosquito netting may be used to cover the vines,
or tobacco dust sifted on thickly.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--Keep free from weeds and stir the ground frequently
and especially after every rain.</p>

<p><i>Squashes</i>.--Keep the ground well cultivated and look out for bugs.
(See <i>Melons</i>.) Layer the vines and cover the joints with fresh soil,
to prevent death of the vines from the attacks of the borer.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Plow up the old bed that has borne two crops,
as it will usually not pay to keep it. Set the ground to late cabbage
or some other crop. The young bed that has borne the first crop should
have a thorough cultivation and the plow run close to the rows to
narrow them to the required width. Pull up or hoe out all weeds and
keep the ground clean the rest of the season. This applies with equal
force to the newly set bed. A bed can be set late next month from
young runners. Pinch off the end after the first joint, and allow it to
root on a sod or in a small pot set level with the surface.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--For an early crop train to a trellis, pinch off all side
shoots, and allow all the strength to go to the main stalk. They may
also be trained to poles, the same as lima beans, and can be set closer
if grown in this way. Spray with the bordeaux mixture for the
blight, keep the foliage thinned and the vines off the ground.</p>

<p><i>Turnips</i>.--Sow for an early fall crop.</p>
<br>

<p><!-- Page 548 --><b>JULY</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Sow the wax sorts for a succession.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--Sow Early Egyptian or Eclipse for young beets next fall.</p>

<p><i>Blackberries</i>.--Head back the young canes to 3 ft., and the laterals
also when they get longer. They may be pinched with the thumbnail
and finger in a small patch, but this soon makes the fingers sore,
and when there are many bushes to go over, it is better to use a pair
of shears or a sharp sickle.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage</i>.--Set plants for the late crop.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>.--Plant sweet corn for succession and late use.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--It is late to plant, but they may be put in for pickles
if done before the Fourth. Cultivate those which are up, and keep
an eye open for bugs.</p>

<p><i>Currants</i>.--Cover a few bushes with muslin or burlap before the
fruit ripens, and you can eat currants in August. Use hellebore,
rather than Paris green, for the last brood of currant worms, and apply
it as soon as the worms appear. There is little danger in using it,
even if the currants are ripe.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i> seed does not germinate well in hot weather. Sow in a
moist, shaded position for a succession.</p>

<p><i>Lima beans</i>.--Hoe them frequently, and give assistance to get on
the poles.</p>

<p><i>Melons</i>.--Watch for bugs, and apply tobacco dust freely around
the plants. Keep them well cultivated. A light application of bone
meal will pay.</p>

<p><i>Peaches, pears, and plums</i> should be thinned to secure fine fruit and
to help sustain the vigor of the tree. Ripening the seed is what draws
on the tree's vitality, and if the number of seeds can be reduced one-half
or two-thirds, part of the strength required to ripen them will
go into perfecting the fruit and seeds left, and add greatly to the fine
appearance, flavor, and quality of the edible portion.</p>

<p><i>Radishes</i>.--Sow the early kinds for a succession, and toward the
end of the month the winter sorts may be put in.</p>

<p><i>Raspberries</i>.--Pinch back the canes to 2-1/2 ft., the same way as
given for blackberries.</p>

<p><i>Squashes</i>.--Keep the ground well stirred, and use tobacco dust
<!-- Page 549 -->freely for bugs and beetles. Cover the joints with fresh soil, to guard
against injury by the vine-borer.</p>
<br>

<p><b>AUGUST</b></p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--A last sowing of the early table sorts may be made for a
succession.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage</i>.--Harvest the early crop, and give good cultivation to
the main crop. Keep down the bugs and worms.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>.--The latest crop may yet be set. Earlier set plants should
be handled as they attain sufficient size. Common drain tiles are excellent
for blanching if one has them, and must be put on when the
plants are about half grown. Hoe frequently to keep the plants
growing.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--Harvest as soon as the bulbs are well formed. Let them
lie on the ground until cured, then draw to the barn floor or some
other airy place and spread thinly. Market when you can get a good
price, and the sooner the better.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i> may be hastened in coloring by being picked just as they
begin to color and placed in single layers in a coldframe or hotbed,
where they can be covered with sash.</p>
<br>

<p><b>SEPTEMBER</b></p>

<p>In many parts of the North it is not too late to sow rye, or peas,
or corn, to afford winter protection for orchards. As a rule, very late
fall plowing for orchards is not advisable. Now is a good time to trim
up the fence-rows and to burn the brush piles, in order to destroy the
breeding places of rabbits, insects, and weeds. Cuttings of gooseberries
and currants may be taken. Use only the wood of the current
year's growth, making the cuttings about a foot long. Strip off the
leaves, if they have not already fallen, tie the cuttings in large bundles,
and bury them in a cold cellar, or in a sandy, well-drained knoll; or
if the cutting-bed is well prepared and well drained, they may be
planted immediately, the bed being well mulched upon the approach
of winter. September and October are good months in which to set
orchards, provided the ground is well prepared and well drained, and
is not too much exposed to sweeping winds. Wet lands should never
<!-- Page 550 -->be set in the fall; and such lands, however, are not fit for orchards.
Strawberries may still be set; also bush fruits.</p>

<p>Seeds of various flowers may now be sown for winter bloom, if one
has a conservatory or good window. Petunias, phloxes, and many
annuals make good window plants. Quicker results are secured,
however, if border plants of petunias and some other things are dug
up just before frost and placed in pots or boxes. Keep them cool and
shaded for a couple of weeks, cut down the tops, and they will send
up a vigorous and floriferous growth. Winter roses should now be
in place in the beds or in pots.</p>

<p>There will be odd days when one can go to the woods and fields and
collect roots of wild herbs and shrubs for planting in the yard or along
the unused borders of the garden.</p>
<br>

<p><b>OCTOBER</b></p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>.--Old plantations should now be cleaned off, and the
tops removed at once. This is a good time to apply manure to the beds.
For young plantations, which may be started now as well as in spring,
select a warm soil and sunny exposure, and give each plant plenty
of room. We like to set them in rows 5 ft. apart and at least 2 ft.
apart in the rows.</p>

<p><i>Cabbages</i>.--The heads that will winter best are those just fully
formed, not the over-ripe ones. For family use, bury an empty barrel
in a well-drained spot, and fill it with good heads. Place a lot of dry
leaves on top, and cover the barrel so that it will shed rain. Or, pile
some cabbages in a corner of the barn floor and cover them with enough
straw to prevent solid freezing. Pages 159, 470.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage-plants,</i> started from seed last month, should be pricked
out in cold-frames, putting about 600 to the ordinary sash and setting
them quite deep.</p>

<p><i>Chicory</i>.--Dig what is wanted for salad, and store it in sand in a
dry cellar.</p>

<p><i>Endive</i>.--Blanch by gathering up the leaves and tying them lightly
at the tips.</p>

<p><i>General garden management</i>.--The only planting that can be done
in open ground at this time is restricted to rhubarb, asparagus, and
<!-- Page 551 -->perhaps onion-sets. Begin to think about next year's planting, and
to make arrangements for the manure that will be needed. Often
you can purchase it now to good advantage, and haul it while the roads
are yet good. Clean up and plow the ground when the crops are
harvested.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Plants to be wintered over should be set in frames like
cabbage-plants.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--Plant sets of Extra Early Pearl, or some other hardy
kind, in the same fashion as in early spring. They are likely to winter
well, and will give an early crop of fine bunching onions. For the
North, fall sowing of onion-seed cannot be recommended.</p>

<p><i>Parsley</i>.--Lift some plants and set them in a coldframe 4 or 5
in. apart, or in a box filled with good soil, and place in a light cellar
or under a shed.</p>

<p><i>Pears</i>.--Pick the winter sorts just before there is danger from
freezing. Put them in a cool, dark place, where they will neither
mold nor shrivel. To hasten ripening, they may be brought into a
warm room as wanted.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb</i>.--If plants are to be set or replanted this fall, enrich the
ground with a superabundance of fine old stable-manure, and give
each plant a few feet of space each way. In order to have fresh pie-plant
in winter, dig up some of the roots and plant them in good
soil in a barrel placed in the cellar.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potatoes.</i>--Dig them when ripe after the first frost. Cut
off the vines, and turn the potatoes out with a potato-fork or plow.
Handle them carefully to prevent bruising. Only sound, well-ripened
roots are in proper condition to be wintered over.</p>
<br>

<p><b>NOVEMBER</b></p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>.--Manure before winter sets in.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--They keep best in pits. Some may be kept in the cellar
for use during winter, but cover them with sand or sods to prevent
shriveling.</p>

<p><i>Blackberries</i>.--Cut away the old wood and mulch the roots.
Tender sorts should be laid down and lightly covered with soil at the
tips.</p>

<p><!-- Page 552 --><i>Carrots</i>.--Treat as advised for beets.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>.--Dig up the stalks, leaving the roots on, and stand them
close together in a narrow trench, tops just even with the ground-level.
Gradually cover them with boards, earth, and manure. Another way
is to set them upright upon the floor of a damp cellar or root-house,
keeping the roots moist and the tops dry. Celery can stand some
frost, but not exposure to less than 22&deg; F. The stalks intended for
use before Christmas may in most localities be left outdoors, to be used
as wanted. Should cold weather set in early, they will need covering
in some way. Page 475.</p>

<p><i>Orchard management</i>.--Young trees should have a mound of earth
raised around the stem as a support and protection against mice, etc.
Small and lately planted trees may have stakes set beside them, and
be tied to the stakes with a broad band. Apple and pear trees may
yet be planted. Trim superfluous or unhealthy wood out of the old
orchards.</p>

<p><i>Spinach</i>.--Cover the beds lightly with leaves or litter before winter
sets in.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Soon it will be time to mulch the beds. Provide
marsh hay, or other coarse litter, free from weed-seeds, and when the
ground has frozen an inch or so, spread it all over the surface thinly
and evenly.</p>
<br>

<p><b>DECEMBER</b></p>

<p><i>Cabbages</i>.--Plants in coldframes should be aired freely and kept
cool. Heads intended for winter and spring use, if not yet taken in or
protected from severe freezing, must now be cared for. Do not cover
them too deeply, nor store them in too warm a place.</p>

<p><i>Carrots</i>.--Store them in cellars or pits. If in cellars, keep the
roots covered with sand or sod, to prevent wilting.</p>

<p><i>General garden management</i>.--Begin now to make your plans for
next season's work. Carefully study up the matter of rotation, also
that of feeding your crops in the most effective and economical manner.
Repair frames, sashes, and tools. Clear up the garden and premises.
Underdrain where needed. Beds for early vegetables should be thrown
up in high, narrow ridges, with deep furrows between. This will
enable you to plant them several days or weeks earlier than otherwise.</p>

<p><!-- Page 553 --><i>Kale</i>.--In very exposed or northern locations cover it lightly
with coarse litter.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>.--For winter storage select only well-ripened, perfectly
dry bulbs. Store them in a dry, airy place, not in the cellar. They
may be spread out thinly on the floor, away from the walls, allowed to
freeze solid, and then covered several feet deep with hay or straw.</p>

<p><i>Parsnips</i>.--Take up some roots for winter use and store them in
sand in the cellar.</p>

<p><i>Strawberry-beds</i> should be given their winter covering of marsh
hay, etc., as soon as the ground is frozen solid.</p>
<br>

<p><b>SUGGESTIONS AND REMINDERS.--II. FOR THE SOUTH</b></p>
<br>

<p><b>JANUARY</b></p>

<p><i>Annuals</i>.--All kinds of hardy annuals and perennials, such as
alyssum, snapdragon, foxglove, hollyhock, phlox, poppy, pansy,
lobelia, candytuft, sweet pea, Chinese pink, sweet william, larkspur,
foliage cinerarias, centaurea, mignonette, and many others of the same
class may be sown. Most of them should be sown thinly and where
they are intended to flower, as they transplant poorly in this latitude.</p>

<p><i>Cannas, caladiums, perennial phloxes, chrysanthemums, and verbenas</i>
may be taken up, divided, and replanted.</p>

<p><i>Roses</i> may be planted in quantities. Let the ground intended for
them have a thorough dressing of manure. Occasionally a plant may
be taken up and divided. The hybrid varieties may now be layered.
This is done as follows: Select a shoot and bend it flat upon the ground;
hold it in both hands, having a distance of about 6 in. between them;
keep the left hand firm, and with the right give the shoot a sharp
twist; now cover it with 4 in. of earth and tie the free end to an
upright stake.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus beds</i> should be liberally manured. New beds should now
be made. Set the plants 6 in. deep. Sow seed now.</p>

<p><i>Beets and all hardy vegetables</i> (carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabagas,
kohlrabi, spinach, lettuce, herbs, etc.) may now be sown, planted, or
transplanted.</p>

<p><!-- Page 554 --><i>Cabbage plants</i> should be set out on heavily manured ground.
Sow seed of Early Summer for a later supply.</p>

<p><i>Fruits</i>.--If possible, all planting and transplanting of fruit-trees
and grape-vines should be finished this month. Pruning should be
completed as soon as possible, and preparation made to protect the
blossoms of tender fruits next month. Set out strawberry-plants, and
during dry weather run the cultivator through all old beds that are
at all weedy. It is a good plan, where practicable, to mulch the beds.
Here, pine-straw can be had plentifully for the purpose. Examine
peach trees for borers. Raspberries and blackberries should be pruned
now if the work is not already done. Cuttings of Le Conte pears,
Marianna plums, grape-vines, and pomegranates should be put in at
once if they have heretofore been forgotten. Root-grafting should be
progressing rapidly; this is the best time for this important work.</p>

<p><i>Onion seeds</i>.--Sow at once, and plant sets as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>.--Sow early and late varieties. The late varieties succeed
best if sown at this season.</p>

<p><i>Seasonable work</i>.--This is a good month to obtain canes for staking
peas, tomatoes, and beans, hauling manure, making repairs, and examining
tools, etc. As the fall crop is harvested, the land should be
prepared for another crop. Tile-draining is now is order. Prepare
frames to cover with canvas for use next month.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potatoes.</i>--A few may be bedded in a frame from which to
obtain &quot;draws&quot; for setting out about March 15.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes, egg-plants, and peppers</i>.--Sow now on a slight hotbed.
When the plants come up, all the air possible should be given during
the day. They can be raised without heat, but at this season this plan
would better be attempted only by the skillful.</p>
<br>

<p><b>FEBRUARY</b></p>

<p><i>Asters, cannas, dahlias, heliotropes, lobelias, petunias, pyrethrums,
ricinus, salvias, and verbenas</i> are best sown in a coldframe, where they
can have some protection from heavy rain.</p>

<p><i>Cannas</i> should be transplanted now.</p>

<p><i>Chrysanthemums</i> must be planted in well-manured ground in a
position where water can be readily supplied to them.</p>

<p><!-- Page 555 --><i>Dahlias</i> may be taken up and divided as soon as they begin growth.</p>

<p><i>Gladiolus and tuberose bulbs</i> should be planted now. It is a good
plan to extend the planting through March and April.</p>

<p><i>Pansies</i>.--Plant them out in the beds where they are to flower.</p>

<p><i>Routine work</i>.--Sodding should now proceed rapidly. If sods cannot
be obtained, the ground may be planted with Bermuda grass.
Plant small pieces of the grass a foot apart and water them if the
weather is dry, and they will grow rapidly. Hedges should be cleared
up and put in good shape. All planting of trees and shrubs should be
finished this month. All pruning of trees must be done early in
the month. Young roses cannot be set too early in February. They
thrive best when planted in fall. Roll the drives and repair them when
necessary. The lawn will now require constant care, and the mower
should be used before the grass becomes 1-1/2 in. high.</p>

<p><i>Bush-beans</i> may be planted February 14. On alluvial land it is best
to plant them on slight rises as a protection against the rains which
sometimes occur toward the end of the month. If frost should
threaten just as the beans begin to peep out, cover them an inch deep
with the plow or hand cultivator. Sow Early Mohawk first, and at
the end of the month sow Early Valentine; a week later sow the wax
varieties.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage</i>,--Sow early varieties, such as Early Summer, Early
Drumhead, and Early Flat Dutch. Etampes, Extra Early Express,
and Winnigstadt sown for small heads in the order named have done
very well in southern Louisiana. The earlier sown plants should
be transplanted as often as convenient. Should worms cause trouble,
dust the plants with a mixture of one part of pyrethrum powder
to six of fine dust.</p>

<p><i>Carrots, celery, beets, endive, kohlrabi, onion sets, parsley, parsnips,
radishes and purple-top turnips</i> must now be sown.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>.--Plant Extra Early Adams, Yellow Canada, Stowell Evergreen,
and White Flint toward the middle of the month. Sow again
a week later, and again after another week. If the first two sowings
fail, the last one will give the early crop.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--Sow and protect with small boxes during cold days
and nights, or sow in pots or on sods. Protect the seedlings with sashes
or canvas, and plant them out late.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Sow seeds and transplant the plants on hand. This
<!-- Page 556 -->crop requires a soil well supplied with plant-food.</p>

<p><i>Melons</i>.--Plant seeds in the same manner as advised for cucumbers.</p>

<p><i>Okra</i>.--Sow seeds on sods and set out the plants next month.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>.--Sow seeds of a number of varieties.</p>

<p><i>Peppers and egg-plants</i>, if not sown last month, should be sown now.
Sow them under glazed sashes and keep close. When the plants appear,
give some air, and increase it according to the weather. If a large
number of plants is required, the sowing may be delayed until next
month. Should flea-beetles trouble you, use plenty of bordeaux on
egg-plants.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes, Irish</i>.--The main crop should be planted as early as
possible. Standard varieties are Early Rose, Peerless, and Burbank.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Run the cultivator through them at least once
every three weeks; if they are to be mulched, collect the necessary
material. Strawberries planted in February seldom yield much of
a crop.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potatoes</i>, can now be bedded and protected with canvas, or
a row or two of whole tubers may be planted for &quot;draws&quot; and vines.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i> in frames should be given all the air and light possible and
plenty of room if protected with canvas, do not allow the plants to
crowd.</p>
<br>

<p><b>MARCH</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Sow all varieties for a fall crop. As soon as the plants
appear, the cultivator must be run through the crop, and kept going
as often as necessary.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>.--Continue to plant; and we recommend harrowing the
patch as soon as the young corn appears. It is generally planted in
hills 3 or 4 ft. apart, but better results will be obtained-by planting
in drills and leaving one stalk every 12 in.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--Sow in hills 4 ft. apart, using a liberal quantity of
seed to each hill. When the plants come up, thin them to about six
in the hill. When the plants begin to get rough leaves, pull out one
or two more from each hill. Striped cucumber-beetles are sometimes
very numerous, and in order to get a stand of plants it is necessary to
<!-- Page 557 -->go through the patch early every morning and sprinkle all the hills
with air-slaked lime.</p>

<p><i>Egg-plants.</i>--Toward the end of the month the plants growing in
frames may be transplanted to their fruiting quarters. Seed may be
sown outside after March 15; sooner if a warm and sheltered spot is
selected.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--Sow in drills, and when the plants are large enough, thin
to a foot apart. If transplanted at this season, they often go to seed.</p>

<p><i>Okra</i>.--A sowing may be made now, but the main planting would
best be deferred until after March 15. Sow in drills 3 ft. apart and
thin the plants to 18 in. apart in the drills.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>.--Early varieties may be sown; it is now too late to sow tall-growing
kinds.</p>

<p><i>Peppers</i>.--Treat as advised for egg-plants.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes, Irish</i>.--It is not too late to plant them, but the sooner
they are planted the better. The crop planted in February should be
harrowed as soon as the shoots begin to come up, and when the rows
can be fairly seen, the cultivator must be set to work to keep down
weeds and grass.</p>

<p><i>Squashes</i>.--Plant seed in hills 6 ft. apart. The directions for
planting melons may be followed. The same remarks apply to pumpkins
and other vegetables of this kind.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potatoes.</i>--If slips or vines are at hand, they may be planted
late in the month for the earliest tubers. The whole potatoes may
be planted on a ridge to yield vines for later planting.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--The mulching of beds or rows should be no longer
delayed, if clean and plentiful fruit is wanted.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--About March 15 the frame plants may go to their
fruiting quarters. It is necessary to use some judgment in this matter,
as they may be killed or injured by an April frost. Seed may be
sown in the open ground for plants for late fruiting. Set the plants 4 ft.
apart each way.</p>
<br>

<p><b>APRIL</b></p>

<p><i>Alternantheras</i> should go out now.</p>

<p><i>Annuals</i> of all kinds may still be sown where they are to flower, as
they transplant with difficulty at this season.</p>

<p><!-- Page 558 --><i>Coleuses</i>.--Plant out in the beds now. Cuttings root readily,
simply requiring to be stuck in.</p>

<p><i>Beans</i> of all kinds can be planted, limas especially.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>.--Make another sowing.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage plants</i> obtained from spring sowings should be set out as
soon as fit. The ground requires to be very rich to carry this crop.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--These can be sown anywhere now.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>.--Make a sowing to yield roasting ears to come in after that
sown last month.</p>

<p><i>Okra</i>.--Sow in drills 3 or 4 ft. apart.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>.--Make a sowing of early varieties for the last time.</p>

<p><i>Squash (bush) and pumpkin</i> may now be planted.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i> should be got out to their fruiting quarters as early in
the month as possible. Let them be set at least 4 ft. apart each way.</p>
<br>

<p><b>MAY</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Plant a few more bush and pole beans.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i> may now be started. The bed or box needs plenty of water,
and should be shaded from sun.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i> requires careful handling to encourage it to germinate.
It is best sown in a box and kept shaded and moist.</p>

<p><i>Melons, cucumbers, squashes, and pumpkins</i> may be sown.</p>

<p><i>Radishes</i>.--Sow the yellow and white summer varieties.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>.--It is a constant struggle with weeds throughout this
month, and the cultivator and plow are ever going. As the land becomes
vacant, sow corn or plant sweet-potatoes--draws or vines.
Sow some late Italian cauliflower. Let the orchard have constant
and thorough cultivation, and remove all unnecessary growth from
the trees as soon as they appear. Be always on the lookout for borers.
Keep the strawberries as free of grass and coco, or knob-grass, as
possible.</p>
<br>

<p><b>JUNE</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--All kinds may now be sown.</p>

<p><i>Cauliflower</i>.--Sow the Italian kinds.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>.--Make a planting at the beginning of the month and again
at the end.</p>

<p><!-- Page 559 --><i>Cucumbers</i>.--Plant a few more hills. The plants at this season
must be given plenty of water.</p>

<p><i>Endive</i>.--Sow, and attend to the tying up of the plants that are
of sufficient size.</p>

<p><i>Melons</i>.--Sow for a succession a few more water and muskmelons.</p>

<p><i>Okra</i> may still be sown.</p>

<p><i>Radishes</i>.--Sow the summer varieties now.</p>

<p><i>Squashes and pumpkins</i> may yet be sown.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potato</i> vines may now be set out in quantities.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--About the middle of the month sow for the fall crop.</p>
<br>

<p><b>JULY</b></p>

<p><i>Beans</i>.--Bush and pole beans may be planted towards the end of
the month.</p>

<p><i>Cabbage and cauliflower</i> may now be sown, but the main sowing should
be deferred until next month.</p>

<p><i>Carrots</i>.--A sowing should be made.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i>.--Sow and transplant what plants there may be on hand.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i>.--These may be sown now for pickling.</p>

<p><i>Endive</i>.--Transplant and sow.</p>

<p><i>Grapes</i> should be kept well tied to trellis, and unnecessary growth
removed, so that the wood may have the chance of becoming thoroughly
ripened. If the cultivator and plow are not used judiciously, a second
growth will be started, which is not desirable.</p>

<p><i>Lettuce</i>.--The seed requires to be sprouted before being sown, and
if the sowing is done on a dry day the drills should be watered.</p>

<p><i>Radishes</i>.--Sow the summer kinds.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i>.--Keep the beds clean of weeds and grass.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--Make a sowing early in the month, or, what is much
better, take cuttings from plants still in bearing.</p>

<p><i>Turnips</i>.--Sow a few after a shower towards the end of the month.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>.--Much cannot be done this month, as the weather is
hot and dry, but the opportunity should not be lost for killing weeds
and preparing for the planting season, which is now rapidly drawing
near.</p>
<br>

<p><!-- Page 560 -->AUGUST</p>

<p><i>Artichokes</i>.--Seed of the Green Globe may be sown now and large
plants obtained by spring. The seed-bed requires to be shaded.</p>

<p><i>Bush beans, beets, pole beans, carrots, celery, endive, kohlrabi, lettuce,
mustard, Black Spanish and Rose China radishes, parsley, turnips,
rutabagas, and salad plants</i> of all kinds may now be sown. The seed
should be sown on small ridges, adaptable to the kind of plants,
for level culture is not successful in the vegetable garden in this section.</p>

<p><i>Broccoli</i> should be more grown, for it is hardier than the cauliflower.
Many cannot tell the difference between the two. Sow now.</p>

<p><i>Cabbages</i> must be sown by the middle of the month. Make the
ground very rich and shade the seed-bed, keeping it moist during the
whole of the time.</p>

<p><i>Cauliflower</i> should also be sown.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes, Irish</i>, should be planted by the middle of the month, if
possible. Plant only those that have sprouted, and instead of planting
on top of the ridge set in the furrow and cover 2 in. deep; as the
potatoes grow, work more soil down to them.</p>

<p><i>Salsify</i>.--Sow now or early next month.</p>

<p><i>Shallots</i>.--Plant them now.</p>

<p><i>Squash</i>.--Bush kinds may be planted now at any time.</p>

<p><i>Sweet-potatoes.</i>--- Vines may still be set out, with prospects of
harvesting a fair crop.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>.--If short of plants, cut off good-sized limbs from bearing
plants and plant them deep. Keep them moist, and they will
root in a few days. Do this just before it rains.</p>
<br>

<p><b>SEPTEMBER</b></p>

<p><i>Annuals</i> of the hardy class may be sown this month: the following
list will assist in making a selection: Calliopsis, candytuft, calendulas,
canterbury bells, columbine, corn-flower, daisies, forget-me-nots,
gaillardia, godetia, larkspur, <i>Limnanthes Douglasii</i>, mignonette, pansies,
<i>Phlox Drummondii</i>, primroses, poppies of all kinds, <i>Saponaria Calabrica,
Silene pendula</i>, sweet williams, and sweet peas.</p>

<p><i>Bulbs</i>.--Study the catalogues and make out your wants, for it
is nearing planting time.</p>

<p><!-- Page 561 --><i>Lilies</i>.--If success is required of the St. Joseph's or Virgin lily
(<i>L. candidum</i>), it must be planted right away.</p>

<p><i>Perennials and biennials</i> should be sown early this month. They
have two good growing months ahead of them yet to make considerable
progress. The seed-bed will require shade during the middle of the
day until the young plants come up; frequent weedings will be required,
as coco has not yet quit growing, and winter weeds are now
putting in an appearance.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>.--All plants used for salad purposes may be sown this
month. The ground between the rows of growing crops should be
kept in a fine, friable condition. Vegetable seeds of all kinds should
always be sown on slight ridges on all but very sandy soils. If the
seed is sown on a level bed, as practiced at the North, the ground will
become as hard as a turnpike road should a heavy rain occur; and
should this shower come along before the plants are up, a crust a
quarter of an inch deep will be formed, and the plants will never see
daylight. Sown on a ridge they come all right, as the water gradually
drains away, leaving the top of the ridge loose and soft.</p>
<br>

<p><b>OCTOBER</b></p>

<p><i>All spring flower seeds</i> should be sown in boxes or trays in the conservatory,
and all spring bulbs should be planted. The hyacinth,
narcissus, tulip and anemone, ranunculus and various lily bulbs,
will bloom in good season planted at this time. The bedding plants
should be carefully watched, so that any attack of aphis may be
treated immediately. Sweet peas may be planted the first of this
month, although they are commonly sown in September. A rich
spot should be selected for them. This is the time to make the new
lawn. The soil should be thoroughly stirred and well pulverized,
mixing in a good dressing of commercial fertilizer, or, if one prefers it,
a mixture which may be made at home, consisting of cotton-seed
meal, acid phosphate, and sulfate of potash, at the rate of 1000 lb.,
300 lb., and 100 lb. respectively, per acre. A rich, well-rotted compost,
as a top dressing, would also be highly beneficial. Roses pruned
late in September or early this month will produce fine winter blooms.</p>

<p><i>In the garden</i> this is a busy month; some of the winter vegetables
<!-- Page 562 -->are growing, and others should be sown. The bud artichokes should
be separated and set fully 3 ft. apart. Onions may still be sown in
the early part of the month, and shallots should be divided and set.
Some beans may be risked, and English peas sown for winter crop.
A few cauliflowers may be tried and cucumbers planted in pots for
the hotbeds next month. The following vegetables should be sown:
Carrots, corn salad, chervil, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, beets, endive,
kohlrabi, kale, lettuce, leeks, mustard, parsley, parsnip, radish,
roquette, spinach, Swiss chard, salsify. Some cabbage and a few
cauliflowers should be added to the list. Turnips should be sown for
succession every two weeks until April or May. The celery should be
kept growing and banking up commenced.</p>

<p>This is an excellent time to plant the new strawberry bed. Make
the bed rich with well-rotted manure and select good, healthy sets.
The Michel's Early and Cloud are probably the most popular varieties
for general planting, and should be set in alternating rows.</p>
<br>

<p><b>NOVEMBER</b></p>

<p><i>Flower seeds and bulbs</i> may be planted this month of the same
varieties as in October. Cuttings of all the herbaceous plants should
be made and potted, for use in the house and for the borders next
season. The coldframes should also be put in order. Some of the
bulbs for winter forcing should be selected and potted. One of the
best Louisiana gardeners recommends the following treatment:
Select good, strong bulbs and plant them in rich, light soil, in 5-in.
pots, covering them about half an inch. Water well and bury the pots
6 or 8 in. deep in the ground, leaving them there about five weeks,
when the bulbs will be found to be well rooted. From this time gradually
expose to the light, and they will soon put forth blooms.</p>

<p><i>The same vegetables</i> may be sown as for October, and the late cabbage
seed planted. The Flat Dutch and Drumhead strains are prime
favorites. New sowings of peas, turnips, mustard, and radishes should
be made, and the hotbeds prepared and set out to cucumbers. Too
much care cannot be taken that the manure should be in the best condition
possible, so that a good supply of heat may be depended upon.
The cucumbers planted last month will be ready now for setting in the
hotbeds, and a winter crop forced.</p>

<p><!-- Page 563 --><i>Orchard and vineyard planting</i>.--This is the time to prepare land.
That on which a late crop of cowpeas has grown is well suited for the
purpose, and should be plowed deeply and well worked over. Towards
the last of the month it should be cultivated again, in order to be ready
for the trees next month.</p>
<br>

<p><b>DECEMBER</b></p>

<p><i>Lawns and yards</i> need watching this month, and attention should
be paid to the old leaves and fall rubbish, which makes the yard look
untidy. A good place for the leaves is the compost heap. Hedges
should be put in shape and the surface drains kept open. Shrubs
and roses should be pruned for an early supply of flowers. The Camellia
Japonicas are now in bloom, and care should be taken that the
small branches are not torn off, instead of being cut properly. Many
of these most beautiful of southern ornamental trees have been ruined
by careless plucking of flowers.</p>

<p><i>Garden and orchard</i>.--Many of the fall vegetables may be sown this
month and others sown for a succession. Peas, spinach, roquette,
radishes, lettuce, endive, and some Early York cabbage should also be
sown. In the old spent hotbeds, tomatoes, peppers, and egg-plants
may be started; there will not be enough heat to hurry them, and
good, strong stocky plants will be secured if care is taken. Irish
potatoes may be risked, should there be a favorable time for planting
during the latter part of the month. Usually they are planted in
January. The chances are about equal should they be planted late
this month. Nuts of all kinds, both for budding and otherwise,
should be planted. Some of the best Louisiana pecans are said to
come true from seed, and may be sown where they are intended to
grow.</p>
