<h1>
Paul's Letter to the Ephesians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus through the will of God,<br>
to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Grace to you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual
blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> even as he chose us in him before
the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish
before him in love;  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> having
predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his desire,  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> to the praise of the glory of his
grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> in whom we have our redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the
riches of his grace,  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> which
he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> making known to us the mystery of
his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> to an administration of the
fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the
heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> in whom also we were assigned an
inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who
works all things after the counsel of his will;  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> to the end that we should be to
the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> in whom you also, having heard
the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,--in whom, having
also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> who is a pledge of our
inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of
his glory.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> For this cause
I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you,
and the love which you have toward all the saints,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> don't cease to give thanks for
you, making mention of you in my prayers,  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> that the God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and
revelation in the knowledge of him;  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> having the eyes of your <a
href="#N1">hearts</a> enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of
his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
the saints,  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> and what is
the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to
that working of the strength of his might  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> which he worked in Christ, when
he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the
heavenly places,  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> far
above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name
that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.
 <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> He put all things in
subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the
assembly,  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> which is his
body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> You were made alive
when you were dead in transgressions and sins,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> in which you once walked according
to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the
air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> among whom we also all once lived
in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> But God, being rich in mercy, for
his great love with which he loved us,  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> even when we were dead through our
trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been
saved),  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> and raised us up
with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ
Jesus,  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> that in the ages to
come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us
in Christ Jesus;  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> for by
grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is
the gift of God,  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> not of
works, that no one would boast.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For we are his workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we
would walk in them.
<p> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Therefore remember
that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called
&quot;uncircumcision&quot; by that which is called
&quot;circumcision,&quot; (in the flesh, made by hands);  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> that you were at that time
separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without
God in the world.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> But now
in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of
Christ.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> For he is our
peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,
 <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> having abolished in the
flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that
he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> and might reconcile them both in
one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.
 <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> He came and preached
peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> For through him we both have our
access in one Spirit to the Father.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> So then you are no longer
strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and
of the household of God,  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> being built on the foundation of
the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief
cornerstone;  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> in whom the
whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
 <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> in whom you also are
built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> For this cause I, Paul,
am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> if it is so that you have heard of
the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;
 <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> how that by revelation the
mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> by which, when you read, you can
perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> which in other generations was not
made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy
apostles and prophets in the Spirit;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> that the Gentiles are fellow
heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise
in Christ Jesus through the Good News,  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> of which I was made a servant,
according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to
the working of his power.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> To me, the very least of all
saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable
riches of Christ,  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> and to
make all men see what is the <a href="#N2">administration</a> of the
mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things
through Jesus Christ;  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> to
the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might
be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,
 <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> according to the eternal
purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> in whom we have boldness and
access in confidence through our faith in him.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Therefore I ask that you may not
lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> For this cause, I bow
my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> from whom every family in heaven
and on earth is named,  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> that he would grant you,
according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with
power through his Spirit in the inward man;  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> that Christ may dwell in your
hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in
love,  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> may be strengthened
to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and
height and depth,  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> and to
know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with
all the fullness of God.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> Now to him who is able to do
exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
power that works in us,  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> to him be the glory in the
assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> I therefore, the
prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which
you were called,  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> with all
lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;
 <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> being eager to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> There is one body, and one Spirit,
even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
 <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> one God and Father of all,
who is over all, and through all, and in us all.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But to each one of us was the
grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Therefore he says, &quot;When he
ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to
men.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Now this, &quot;He ascended,&quot;
what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the
earth?  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> He who descended
is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill
all things.
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> He gave some to be
apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, <a
href="#N4">shepherds</a> and teachers;  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> for the perfecting of the saints,
to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> until we all attain to the unity
of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man,
to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> that we may no longer be
children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of
doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
 <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> but speaking truth in
love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;
 <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> from whom all the body,
being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies,
according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the
body increase to the building up of itself in love.
<p> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> This I say therefore,
and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the
Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> being darkened in their
understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance
that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> who having become callous gave
themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> But you did not learn Christ that
way;  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> if indeed you heard
him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> that you put away, as concerning
your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts
of deceit;  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> and that you
be renewed in the spirit of your mind,  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> and put on the new man, who in
the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of
truth.
<p> <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> Therefore, putting
away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members
of one another.  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> &quot;Be
angry, and don't sin.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N5">*</a></sup></font> Don't let the sun go down on your wrath,
 <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> neither give place to the
devil.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> Let him who stole
steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing
that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.
 <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> Let no corrupt speech
proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need
may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of
God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> Let all bitterness, wrath, anger,
outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.  <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> And be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave
you.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Be therefore imitators
of God, as beloved children.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Walk in love, even as Christ also
loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God
for a sweet-smelling fragrance.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> But sexual immorality, and all
uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as
becomes saints;  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> nor
filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate;
but rather giving of thanks.
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Know this for sure,
that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who
is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Let no one deceive you
with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on
the children of disobedience.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Therefore don't be partakers with
them.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> For you were once
darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
 <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> for the fruit of the
Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> proving what is well pleasing to
the Lord.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Have no
fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove
them.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> For the things
which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> But all things, when they are
reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.
 <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Therefore he says,
&quot;Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine
on you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Therefore watch
carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> redeeming the time, because the
days are evil.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Therefore
don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Don't be drunken with wine, in
which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> speaking to one another in
psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your
heart to the Lord;  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> giving
thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to God, even the Father;  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> subjecting yourselves one to
another in the fear of Christ.
<p> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Wives, be subject to
your own husbands, as to the Lord.  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> For the husband is the head of
the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the
savior of the body.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> But
as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their
own husbands in everything.
<p> <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Husbands, love your
wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;
 <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> that he might sanctify
it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> that he might present the
assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> Even so husbands also ought to
love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves
himself.  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> For no man ever
hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also
does the assembly;  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> because we are members of his
body, of his flesh and bones.  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> &quot;For this cause a man will
leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will
become one flesh.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> This mystery is great, but I
speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.  <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> Nevertheless each of you must
also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she
respects her husband.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Children, obey your
parents in the Lord, for this is right.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> &quot;Honor your father and
mother,&quot; which is the first commandment with a promise:  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> &quot;that it may be well with
you, and you may live long on the earth.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> You fathers, don't
provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and
instruction of the Lord.
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Servants, be obedient
to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and
trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> not in the way of service only
when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing
the will of God from the heart;  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> with good will doing service, as
to the Lord, and not to men;  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> knowing that whatever good thing
each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is
bound or free.
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> You masters, do the
same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both
their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.
<p> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Finally, be strong in
the Lord, and in the strength of his might.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Put on the whole armor of God,
that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> For our wrestling is not against
flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers,
against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the
spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Therefore, put on the whole armor
of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having
done all, to stand.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Stand
therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and
having put on the breastplate of righteousness,  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> and having fitted your feet with
the preparation of the Good News of peace;  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> above all, taking up the shield
of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
evil one.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> And take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word
of God;  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> with all prayer
and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to
this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> on my behalf, that utterance may
be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the
mystery of the Good News,  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> for which I am an ambassador in
chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
<p> <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> But that you also may
know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and
faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> whom I have sent to you for this
very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your
hearts.
<p> <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> Peace be to the
brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> Grace be with all
those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web4910h.htm or web4910h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web4910ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
