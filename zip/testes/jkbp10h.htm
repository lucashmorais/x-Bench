<h1>JOHN KEBLE&rsquo;S PARISHES: A HISTORY OF HURSLEY AND OTTERBOURNE</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>To explain the present undertaking, it should be mentioned that a
history of Hursley and North Baddesley was compiled by the Reverend
John Marsh, Curate of Hursley, in the year 1808.&nbsp; It was well and
carefully done, with a considerable amount of antiquarian knowledge.&nbsp;
It reached a second edition, and a good deal of it was used in <i>Sketches
of Hampshire</i>, by John Duthy, Esq.&nbsp; An interleaved copy received
many annotations from members of the Heathcote family.&nbsp; There was
a proposal that it should be re-edited, but ninety years could not but
make a great difference in these days of progress, so that not only
had the narrative to be brought up to date, but further investigations
into the past brought facts to light which had been unknown to Mr. Marsh.</p>
<p>It was therefore judged expedient to rewrite the whole, though, whenever
possible, the former Curate&rsquo;s work has been respected and repeated;
but he paid little attention to the history of Otterbourne, and a good
deal has been since disclosed, rendering that village interesting.&nbsp;
Moreover, the entire careers of John Keble and Sir William Heathcote
needed to be recorded in their relations to the parish and county.&nbsp;
This has, therefore, here been attempted, together with a record of
the building of the three churches erected since 1837, and a history
of the changes that have taken place; though the writer is aware that
there is no incident to tempt the reader - no siege of the one castle,
no battle more important than the combat in the hayfield between Mr.
Coram and the penurious steward, and, till the last generation, no striking
character.&nbsp; But the record of a thousand peaceful years is truly
a cause of thankfulness, shared as it is by many thousand villages,
and we believe that a little investigation would bring to light, in
countless other places, much that is well worth remembrance.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those who take an interest in provincial dialect,
some specimens are appended, which come from personal knowledge.</p>
<p>The lists of birds and of flowers are both from the actual observation
of long residents who have known the country before, in many instances,
peculiarities have faded away before the march of progress.</p>
<p>The writer returns many warm thanks to those who have given much
individual assistance in the undertaking, which could not have been
attempted without such aid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I - MERDON AND OTTERBOURNE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The South Downs of England descend at about eight miles from the
sea into beds of clay, diversified by gravel and sand, and with an upper
deposit of peaty, boggy soil, all having been brought down by the rivers
of which the Itchen and the Test remain.</p>
<p>On the western side of the Itchen, exactly at the border where the
chalk gives way to the other deposits, lies the ground of which this
memoir attempts to speak.&nbsp; It is uneven ground, varied by undulations,
with gravelly hills, rising above valleys filled with clay, and both
alike favourable to the growth of woods.&nbsp; Fossils of belemnite,
cockles (<i>cardium</i>), and lamp-shells (<i>terebratula</i>) have
been found in the chalk, and numerous echini, with the pentagon star
on their base, are picked up in the gravels and called by the country
people Shepherds&rsquo; Crowns - or even fossil toads.&nbsp; Large boulder
stones are also scattered about the country, exercising the minds of
some observers, who saw in certain of them Druidical altars, with channels
for the flow of the blood, while others discerned in these same grooves
the scraping of the ice that brought them down in the Glacial age.</p>
<p>But we must pass the time when the zoophytes were at work on our
chalk, when the lamp-shells rode at anchor on shallow waves, when the
cockles sat &ldquo;at their doors in a rainbow frill,&rdquo; and the
belemnites spread their cuttlefish arms to the sea, and darkened the
water for their enemies with their store of ink.</p>
<p>Nor can we dwell on the deer which left their bones and horns in
the black, boggy soil near the river, for unfortunately these were disinterred
before the time when diggers had learnt to preserve them for museums,
and only reported that they had seen remains.</p>
<p>Of <i>human</i> times, a broken quern was brought to light when digging
the foundation of Otterbourne Grange; and bits of pottery have come
to light in various fields at Hursley, especially from the barrows on
Cranbury Common.&nbsp; In 1882 and 1883 the Dowager Lady Heathcote,
assisted by Captain John Thorp, began to search the barrows on the left
hand side of the high road from Hursley to Southampton, and found all
had been opened in the centre, but scarcely searched at all on the sides.&nbsp;
In July they found four or five urns of unbaked clay in one barrow -
of early British make, very coarse, all either full of black earth or
calcined bones, and all inverted and very rough in material, with the
exception of one which was of a finer material, red, and like a modern
flower-pot in shape.&nbsp; Several of these urns were deposited in the
Hartley Museum, Southampton.</p>
<p>Of the Roman times we know nothing but that part of the great Roman
road between Caer Gwent (or Venta Belgarum, as the Romans called Winchester)
and Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum).&nbsp; It can still be traced at Hursley,
and fragments of another leading to Clausentum (Southampton) on the
slope of Otterbourne hill.</p>
<p>In Dr. Milner&rsquo;s <i>History of Winchester</i>, written at the
end of the last century, he describes a medallion of mixed metal bearing
the head of Julius C&aelig;sar, which was dug up by a labourer at Otterbourne,
in the course of making a new road.&nbsp; He thought it one of the plates
carried on the Roman standards of the maniples; but alas! on being sent,
in 1891, to be inspected at the British Museum, it was pronounced to
be one of a cinquecento series of the twelve C&aelig;sars.</p>
<p>The masters of the world have left us few traces of their possession,
and in fact the whole district was probably scarcely inhabited; but
the trees and brushwood or heather of the southern country would have
joined the chalk downs, making part of what the West Saxons called the
Jotunwald, or Giant&rsquo;s Wood, and the river Ytene, and so Itchen
seems to have been named in like manner.</p>
<p>These were the times when churches were built and the boundaries
of estates became those of parishes.&nbsp; The manor of Merdon, which
occupied the whole parish of Hursley, belonged to the Bishops of Winchester
by a grant of Oynegils, first Christian King.&nbsp; Milner, in his <i>History
of Winchester</i>, wishes to bestow on Merdon the questionable honour
of having been the place where, in the year 754, the West Saxon King
Cenwulf was murdered by his brother in the house of his lady-love; but
Mr. Marsh, the historian of Hursley, proves at some length that Merton
in Surrey was more likely to have been the scene of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Church property being exempted from William the Conqueror&rsquo;s
great survey, neither Merdon nor Hursley appears in Domesday Book, though
Otterbourne, and even the hundred of Boyate or Boviate, as it is in
the book, appear there.&nbsp; It had once belonged, as did Baddesley
first, at first to one named Chepney, then to Roger de Mortimer, that
fierce Norman warrior who was at first a friend and afterwards an enemy
to William I.</p>
<p>The entire district, except the neighbourhood of Merdon Manor on
the one hand, and of the Itchen on the other, was probably either forest
ground or downs, but it escaped the being put under forest laws at the
time when the district of Ytene became the New Forest.&nbsp; Probably
the king was able to ride over down, heather, and wood, scarcely meeting
an enclosure the whole way from Winchester; and we can understand his
impatience of the squatters in the wilder parts, though the Cistercian
Abbey of Beaulieu was yet to be founded.&nbsp; Indeed Professor E. A.
Freeman does not accept the statement that there could possibly have
been thirty-nine village churches to be destroyed in the whole district
of &ldquo;Ytene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tradition lingered to the present time at Otterbourne that the
corpse of William Rufus was brought back in Purkiss&rsquo;s wood-cart
from Minestead to Winchester for burial in the Cathedral, along a track
leading from Hursley to Otterbourne, called at each end King&rsquo;s
Lane, though it is not easy to see how the route could have lain through
both points.</p>
<p>The parish of Hursley lies in the hundred of Buddlesgate, and division
of Fawley; and the village is situated on the turnpike-road leading
from Winchester to Romsey, and nearly at an equal distance from each
of those places.</p>
<p>The parishes by which Hursley is surrounded were, when Mr. Marsh
wrote, Sparsholt on the north; Farley on the north-west; Michelmersh
and Romsey on the west; Baddesley, North Stoneham, and Otterbourne on
the south; and Compton and St. Cross on the east.</p>
<p>The whole parish was then upwards of twenty-eight miles in circumference,
and contained 10,590 acres of land, of which 2600 were in common, 372
in roads and lanes, about 1000 under growth of coppice-wood, and the
rest either arable or pasture.</p>
<p>The soil in the parish of Hursley, as may be supposed in so extensive
a tract of land, is of several different sorts; in some parts it is
light and shallow, and of a chalky nature; in others, particularly on
the east and west sides of the parish, it is what is called <i>strong</i>
land, having clay for its basis; and in others, especially that of the
commons and fields adjoining, it consists principally of sand or gravel.&nbsp;
Towards the west, it is entirely covered with wood, not in general bearing
trees of large size, but some beautiful beech-trees; and breaking into
peaty, boggy ground on the southern side.&nbsp; The northern side is
of good rich loam, favourable to the growth of fine trees, and likewise
forms excellent arable land.&nbsp; This continues along the valley of
Otterbourne, along a little brook which falls into the Itchen.&nbsp;
It is for the most part of thick clay, fit for brick-making, with occasional
veins of sand, and where Otterbourne hill rises, beds of gravel begin
and extend to the borders of the Itchen, through a wooded slope known
as Otterbourne Park.</p>
<p>The boundaries of estates fixed those of parishes, and Otterbourne
was curiously long and narrow, touching on Compton and Twyford to the
north and north-west, on Stoneham to the south, and Hursley to the west,
lying along the bank of the Itchen.</p>
<p>The churches of both parishes were probably built in the twelfth
century, for though Hursley Church has been twice, if not three times,
rebuilt, remains of early Norman mouldings have been found built into
the stone-work of the tower.&nbsp; And on the wall of the old Otterbourne
Church a very rude fresco came partially to light.&nbsp; Traced in red
was a quatrefoil within a square, the corners filled up with what had
evidently been the four Cherubic figures, though only the Winged Ox
was clearly traceable.&nbsp; Within the quatrefoil was a seated Figure,
with something like scales in one hand, apparently representing our
Lord in His glory.&nbsp; The central compartment was much broken away,
but there was the outline of a man whom one in a hairy garment was apparently
baptizing.&nbsp; The rest had disappeared.</p>
<p>These paintings surmounted three acutely-pointed arches, with small
piers, and square on the side next the nave, but on the other side slender
shafts with bell-shaped capitals, carved with bold round mouldings and
deep hollows.&nbsp; Two corbels supporting the horizontal drip-stone
over the west window were also clear and sharply cut; and the doorway
on the south side had slender shafts and deep mouldings, in one of which
is the dog-tooth moulding going even down to the ground on each side.&nbsp;
This is still preserved in the entrance to the Boys&rsquo; School.</p>
<p>These remnants date the original building for about the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; It may have been due to King Stephen&rsquo;s brother,
Bishop Henry de Blois of Winchester, who is known to have raised the
castle whose remains still exist on his manor of Merdon, where once
there had been a Roman encampment.&nbsp; So far as his work can be traced,
the first thing he would do would be to have a similar embankment thrown
up, and a parapet made along the top, behind which men-at-arms would
be stationed, the ditch below having a stockade of sharp stakes.&nbsp;
In the middle of the enclosure a well was begun, which had to go deeper
and deeper through the chalk, till at last water was found at 300 feet
deep - a work that must have lasted a year or more.&nbsp; Around the
well, leaving only a small courtyard, were all the buildings of the
castle meant for the Bishop&rsquo;s household and soldiers.&nbsp; The
entrance to it all was probably over a drawbridge across the great ditch
(which, on this side, was not less than 60 feet deep), and through a
great gateway between two high square towers, which must have stood
where now there is a slope leading down from the level of the inner
court to that surrounded by a bank.&nbsp; This slope is probably formed
by the ruins of the gateway and tower having been pitched into the ditch,
as the readiest way of getting rid of them when the castle was dismantled
afterwards.&nbsp; We are indebted to the late Sir John Cowell for the
conjectural plan and description of the castle.</p>
<p>As soon as the Bishop had completed this much he would feel tolerably
safe, but he would not be satisfied.&nbsp; He could hardly have room
in his castle for all his retainers, and he could not command the country
from it, except towards the south; therefore his next work was to make
an embankment and the ditch on the outer side of it.&nbsp; It was then
an unbroken semicircle, jutting out as it were from the castle, and
protecting a sufficient space of ground for troops to encamp.</p>
<p>In case of an enemy forcing their way into this, the defenders could
retreat into the castle by the drawbridge.&nbsp; The entrance was on
the east side, and in order to protect this and the back of the castle,
by which is meant the northern side, another embankment was made and
finished with a parapet.&nbsp; Also as, in case of this being carried
by the enemy, it would be impossible for the defenders in the northern
part of the castle to run round the castle and into shelter by the main
gateway, he built a square tower (exactly opposite to the ruin which
yet remains), and divided from it only by the great ditch.&nbsp; On
either side of the tower - cutting the embankment across, therefore,
at right angles - was a little ditch, spanned by a drawbridge, which,
if the defenders thought it necessary to retire to the tower, could
at any time be raised (the foundations of the tower and the position
of the ditches can still be distinctly traced).&nbsp; Supposing, further,
that it became impossible to hold the tower, the besieged could retreat
into the main body of the castle by means of another drawbridge across
the great ditch, which would lead them through the arch (which can still
be seen in the ruins, though it is partially blocked up).&nbsp; The
room on the east side of this passage was probably a guard-room.&nbsp;
In some castles of this date there were also two or three tunnels bored
through the earth-work from the inner courtyard to the bottom of the
great ditch, so as to provide additional ways of retreat for such men
as might otherwise be cut off in those parts most distant from either
of the great gates, in order to secure the outlying defence.</p>
<p>Henry de Blois must have been thinking of the many feudal castles
of his native France.&nbsp; He was a magnificent prelate, though involved
in the wars of his brother and the Empress Matilda.&nbsp; The hospital
of St. Cross, and much of the beauty of Romsey Abbey, are ascribed to
him, and he even endeavoured to obtain that Winchester should be raised
to the dignity of a Metropolitan See.&nbsp; It does not appear that
all his elaborate defences at Merdon were ever called into practical
use; and when his brother, King Stephen, died in 1154, he fled from
England, and the young Henry II. in anger dismantled Merdon, together
with his other castles of Wolvesey and Waltham; nor were these fortifications
ever restored.&nbsp; The king and bishop were reconciled; and the latter
spent a pious and penitent old age, only taking one meal a day, and
spending the surplus in charity.&nbsp; He died in 1174.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER II - MEDI&AElig;VAL GIFTS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was considered in the Middle Ages that tithes might be applied
to any church purpose, and were not the exclusive right of the actual
parish priest, provided he obtained a sufficient maintenance, which
in those days of celibacy was not very expensive.&nbsp; The bishops
and other patrons thus assigned the great tithes of corn of many parishes
to religious foundations elsewhere, only leaving the incumbent the smaller
tithe from other crops - an arrangement which has resulted in many abuses.</p>
<p>Thus in 1301, when Bishop Sawbridge or Points, or as it was Latinised,
de Pontissara, founded the college of St. Elizabeth, in St. Stephen&rsquo;s,
Merdon, by the Itchen at Winchester, for the education of twelve poor
boys by a provost and fellows, he endowed it in part with the great
tithe of Hursley.&nbsp; The small tithes having been found insufficient
for the maintenance of the vicar, he united to Hursley the rectory of
Otterbourne, giving the great tithes to the vicar of Hursley; and in
1362 Bishop Edyngton confirmed the transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh thus relates the transaction:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Living of Hursley was anciently a rectory, and, as it
is believed, wholly unconnected with any other church or parish.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, however, for the parishioners, as well as for the minister,
it was, about the year 1300, reduced to a vicarage, and the great tithes
appropriated to the College of St. Elizabeth in Winchester.&nbsp; The
small tithes which remained being inadequate to the support of the vicar
and his necessary assistants, the church of Otterbourne was consolidated
with that of Hursley, and the tithes of that parish, both great and
small, were given to them to make up a sufficient maintenance - an arrangement
which, in that dark age, was thought not only justifiable but even laudable,
but which nevertheless deserves to this day to be severely censured,
since not only the minister but both the parishes and the cause of religion
have suffered a serious and continued injury from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person by whom this appropriation was made was John de
Pontissara, <i>alias</i> Points, Bishop of Winchester, the founder of
the college to which the tithes were granted; it was, however, afterwards
confirmed by William de Edyngton, by whom the vicar&rsquo;s rights,
which before were probably undefined, and perhaps the subject of contention,
were ascertained and secured to him by endowment.&nbsp; This instrument
is still in being, bearing the date of 1362.&nbsp; It may be seen in
Bishop Edyngton&rsquo;s Register, part I, fol. 128, under the following
marginal title:- &lsquo;Ratificatio et Confirmatio appropriationis Ecclesiae
de Hursleghe, et ordinationes Vicarie ejusd.&rsquo;&nbsp; The following
is a translation of it, so far as the vicar&rsquo;s interests are concerned
in it:- &lsquo;The said vicar shall have and receive all and all manner
of tithes, great and small, with all offerings and other emoluments
belonging to the chapel of Otterbourne, situated within the parish of
the said church (viz. of Hursley).&nbsp; He shall also have and receive
all offerings belonging to the church of Hursley, and all small tithes
arising within the parish of the same, viz., the tithes of cheese, milk,
honey, wax, pigs, lambs, calves, eggs, chickens, geese, pigeons, flax,
apples, pears, and all other tithable fruits whatsoever of curtilages
or gardens.&nbsp; He shall also receive the tithes of mills already
erected, or that shall be erected.&nbsp; He shall also receive and have
all personal tithes of all traders, servants, labourers, and artificers
whatsoever, due to the said church.&nbsp; The said Vicar shall also
receive and have all mortuaries whatsoever, live and dead, of whatsoever
things they may consist.&nbsp; The said Vicar shall also receive and
have all profit and advantage arising from the herbage of the churchyard.&nbsp;
He shall also have and receive the tithes of all fish-ponds whatsoever,
within the said parish, wheresoever made, or that hereafter shall be
made.&nbsp; The said Vicar shall also have for his habitation the space
on the south side of the churchyard, measuring in length, from the said
churchyard and the rectorial house, formerly belonging to the said church,
towards the south, twenty-seven perches; and in breadth, from the hedge
and ditch between the said space and the garden of the aforesaid former
rectory on the west, towards the east, sixteen perches and a half, with
the buildings erected thereon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the above, John de Pontissara allotted to the Vicar
the tithes of wool, beans, and vetches; but of the first of these he
was deprived by Bishop Edyngton&rsquo;s endowment, and the latter have
been so little cultivated that he has never yet derived any advantage
from them, though his right to this species of tithes cannot, I suppose,
be questioned, unless, indeed, they are comprehended under the term
<i>Bladum</i>, and are consequently to be considered as the portion
of the Impropriator.&nbsp; The tithes given by the Endowment to the
President and Chaplains of St. Elizabeth College are - &lsquo;Decim&aelig;
Bladi cujuscunque generis, F&oelig;ni ac Lan&aelig;,&rsquo; and no other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church of Hursley is situated within the deanery of Winchester,
and is a Peculiar; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17">{17}</a>
a distinction which it enjoys, probably, in consequence of its having
been formerly under the patronage of the bishop.&nbsp; The advantages
of this are, that it is not subject to the archdeacon&rsquo;s jurisdiction;
that the minister is not obliged to attend his visitations; and that
he has the privilege of granting letters of administration to wills,
when the property conveyed by them lies within the limits of the vicarage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value of the benefice, as rated in the King&rsquo;s Book,
is &pound;9 per annum, and the tenths are of course 18s.&nbsp; These
the incumbent is required to pay annually, but he is exempted from the
payment of the First Fruits.&nbsp; The land-tax with which the vicarage
is charged is &pound;14: 1: 2&frac12; per annum; and the procurations
and diet-money payable on account of the Bishop&rsquo;s Visitation amount
to 12s. 9&frac12;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patronage of the living, when a rectory, belonged to the bishops
of Winchester, and afterwards, when reduced to a vicarage, was expressly
reserved to himself and his successors by William de Edyngton; and so
long as they kept possession of the Manor of Merdon, they continued
patrons of the vicarage.&nbsp; This Bishop Edyngton, the same who began
the alteration of the cathedral, is said to have built the second church
of All Saints at Hurley, the tower of which still remains.</p>
<p>William of Wykeham, among his wider interests, seems to have had
little concern with Hursley or Otterbourne.</p>
<p>The bishops possessed numerous manors in the diocese, and these were
really not only endowments, but stations whence the episcopal duty of
visitation could be performed.&nbsp; Riding forth with his train of
clergy, chaplains, almoners, lawyers, crossbearers, and choristers,
besides his household of attendants, the bishop entered a village, where
the bells were rung, priest, knight, franklins, and peasants came out
with all their local display, often a guild, to receive him, and other
clergy gathered in; mass was said, difficulties or controversies attended
to, confirmation given to the young people and children, and, after
a meal, the bishop proceeded, sometimes to a noble&rsquo;s castle, or
a convent, but more often to another manor of his own, where he was
received by his resident steward or park-keeper, and took up his abode,
the neighbouring clergy coming in to pay their respects, mention their
grievances, and hold counsel with him.&nbsp; His dues were in the meantime
collected, and his residence lasted as long as business, ecclesiastical
or secular, required his presence, or till he and his train had eaten
up the dues in kind that came in.</p>
<p>Whether the visit was welcome or not depended a good deal on the
character of the prelate, and the hold he kept on his subordinates.&nbsp;
The great courtly bishops, like William of Wykeham, generally sent their
suffragans, titular bishops <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, to perform
their duties.</p>
<p>One of the park-keepers of Merdon was judged worthy of a Latin epitaph,
probably the work of a chaplain or of a Winchester scholar to whom he
had endeared himself:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Hic in humo stratus, John Bowland est tumulatus<br />Vir pius et
gratus et ab omnibus hinc peramatus<br />Custos parcorum praestans quondam

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Here laid in the ground, John Bowland hath sepulture,<br />A man
of faith and kindliness, and hence by all beloved.<br />He was aforetime
the excellent guardian of this park<br />Belonging to certain lords
of Merdon and Winchester.<br />He for (lit. <i>in</i>) 50 years - (8

of all the community was guardian among them.</p>
<p>The Festival of Clement was his date of dying<br />In years one thousand
four hundred after Christ&rsquo;s Redemption,<br />Adding to these four
(?) (years) and seventy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, O Christ, befriend
with those who are thine!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Unlike Hursley, or rather the Manor of Merdon, Otterbourne had many
different possessors in succession, and is even at the present day divided
into various holdings on different tenures.</p>
<p>In 1244 Walter and John de Brompton, sons of Sir Bryan de Brompton,
lived at Hayswode, a name now lost or changed into &ldquo;Otterbourne
Park,&rdquo; the wood spreading over the east side of the hill.&nbsp;
At the same time Sir Henry de Capella was possessor of the manor; but
in 1265 it had passed, by what means we do not know, to Sir Francis
de Bohun - a very early specimen of this Christian name which was derived
from the sobriquet of the Saint of Assisi, whose Christian name was
John.</p>
<p>From the son of Sir Francis in 1279 Simon the Draper obtained the
Manor of Otterbourne for 600 merks, and a quit rent of a pair of gilt
spurs valued at six pence!&nbsp; Simon seems to have assumed the gilt
spurs himself, for he next appears as &ldquo;Sir Simon de Wynton.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed it seems that knighthood might be conferred on the possessors
of a certain amount of land.&nbsp; Wynton in two more generations has
lengthened into Wynchester, when, in 1379, the manor is leased to Hugh
Croans, merchant, and Isabella his wife for their lives, paying after
the first twenty-five years &pound;100 per annum.&nbsp; And two years
later William de Winchester conveyed the manor over to Hugh Croans or
Crans.</p>
<p>The great Bishop William of Wykeham bought it in 1386, and gave it
to his cousin, bearing the same name.&nbsp; It continued in the Wykeham
family till 1458, when William Fiennes or Fenys, Lord Say and Sele,
the son of him who was murdered by Jack Cade&rsquo;s mob, being married
to the heiress, Margaret Wykeham, sold it to Bishop Waynflete for &pound;600.</p>
<p>The bishop&rsquo;s treasurer was Hugh Pakenham; and being one of
the feoffees to whom the manor was conveyed for the bishop, he pretended
that he had bought it for himself, and absconded with some of the title
deeds; but eventually he died <i>in magna miseria</i> in sanctuary at
St. Martin&rsquo;s le Grand, Westminster.&nbsp; His son John renounced
the pretended claim, and very generously the Bishop gave him &pound;40.</p>
<p>In 1481, good Bishop Waynflete made over the property to his newly-founded
College of St. Mary Magdalen at Oxford, in whose possession it has remained
ever since, except small portions which have been enfranchised from
time to time.&nbsp; It includes Otterbourne hill, with common land on
the top and wood upon the slope, as well as various meadows and plough
lands.&nbsp; The manor house, still bearing the name of the Moat House,
was near the old church in the meadows, and entirely surrounded with
its own moat.&nbsp; It must have been a house of some pretension in
the sixteenth century, for there is a handsome double staircase, a rough
fresco in one room, and in the lowest there was a panel over the fireplace,
with a painting representing apparently a battle between Turks and Austrians.&nbsp;
The President of Magdalen College on progress always held his court
there.&nbsp; The venerable Dr. Rowth in extreme old age was the last
who did so.&nbsp; Since his time the bridge crossing the moat fell in
and choked it; it became a marsh; the farm was united to another, the
picture removed, and the only inhabitants are such a labourer&rsquo;s
family as may be impervious to the idea that it is haunted.</p>
<p>Simon the Draper, otherwise Sir Simon de Wynton, granted a plot of
land to the north-west of the Manor House to Adam de Lecke in villeinage,
and later in freehold to John de Otterbourne, reserving thirteen shillings
rent.&nbsp; By this last it was rented on his wife Alice, from whom
it passed through several hands to John Colpoys in the year of Henry
VI., and twenty-two years later this same John Colpoys agreed with the
warden and fellows of Winchester College to enfeoff them of one messuage,
four tofts, twenty acres of arable land, and eighteen acres of meadow,
to the intent that they should on the 7th day of April in every year
celebrate the <i>obits</i> of Alice his deceased wife, of John Giles
and Maud his wife (her parents), of Sir John Shirborne and of Joan Parke,
and of Colpoys himself and Joan his then wife, after their respective
deaths.</p>
<p>These <i>obits</i>, namely anniversaries of deaths when masses were
to be offered for the person recollected, were to be secured by the
fee of a shilling to the warden on each occasion, sixpence to each fellow
and chaplain, and likewise to the schoolmaster, twopence to each lay
clerk, sixpence to the sacrist for wax candles, and a mark or thirteen
and fourpence to be spent in a &ldquo;pittance&rdquo; extra course in
the college hall.&nbsp; The indenture by which Colpoys hoped to secure
perpetual masses in remembrance of his relations and himself is in perfect
preservation, with seals attached, in the muniment chamber of Winchester
College.</p>
<p>The property has continued ever since in the possession of the College
of St. Mary, Winchester, though the masses ceased to be celebrated after
the Reformation.</p>
<p>In those days the rector of Hursley was John de Ralegh, probably
a kinsman of the bishop of that name.</p>
<p>Before this, however, Bishop Richard Toclive had a dispute with the
Knights of St. John, who claimed the almshouse of Noble Poverty at St.
Cross as Hospitallers.&nbsp; They had unfortunately a reputation for
avarice, and Toclive bought them off by giving them the impropriation
of Merton and Hursleigh <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25">{25}</a>
for 53 marks a year.</p>
<p>PAGANUS DE LYSKERET, styled Presbyter, was collated in 1280.&nbsp;
It appears that at this time there was a perpetual vicar established
in the Church of Hursley as well as a rector; and that he was instituted
by the bishop, had a certain fixed maintenance assigned to him, and
was independent of the rector.&nbsp; In the register of John de Pontissera,
Bishop of Winton, may now be seen what is there called the &ldquo;Ordinatio
Episcopi inter Rectorem et Vicarium de Hurslegh.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
therein settled that the vicar shall have a house as described and other
emoluments, and that the rector shall pay to him forty shillings per
annum.&nbsp; The vicar at this time was Johannes de Sta. Fide.&nbsp;
The deed of settlement was executed in Hyde Abbey, in the year 1291;
Philip de Barton, John de Ffleming, William de Wenling, and others being
witnesses to it.&nbsp; Vide Regist. de Pontissera, fol. 10.&nbsp; Forty
shillings or five marks was, it appears, the stipend usually assigned
to vicars and curates at this time, the vicar being <i>really</i> what
we now call a curate.</p>
<p>HUGO DE WELEWYCK, styled Clericus, succeeded in 1296 on the resignation
of Paganus and was the last rector, the benefice having in his time
been reduced to a vicarage by the appropriation of the rectorial-house,
tithes, and glebe to the College of St. Elizabeth.&nbsp; The <i>pretences</i>
assigned for this act, for true <i>reasons</i> they could scarcely be,
since in all cases of appropriation and consolidation they appear to
have been almost exactly the same, were the unfinished state of the
college buildings and the insufficiency of the revenues for the maintenance
of the society, owing to wars, sickness, pestilence, and the like.&nbsp;
But notwithstanding this serious deprivation and loss, a vicar it appears
was still continued in the church, Hugh de Welewyck having presented
two, viz. Henricus de Lyskeret in 1300, and Roger de la Vere in 1302;
of whom the latter was certainly appointed after the appropriation.</p>
<p>WILLIAM DE FFARLEE was collated Vicar of Hursley, on the death of
Welewyck in 1348.</p>
<p>WILLIAM DE MIDDLETON was collated in 1363.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER III - REFORMATION TIMES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The rectorial tithe of Hursley having been given to St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
College, and apparently some rights over Merdon, the Chancellor Wriothesley
obtained that, on the confiscation of monastic property, the manor should
be granted to him.&nbsp; Stephen Gardiner had been bishop since 1531,
a man who, though he had consented to the king&rsquo;s assumption of
the royal supremacy, grieved over the fact as an error all his life.&nbsp;
He appeared at the bar of the House of Commons and pleaded the rights
of his See, to which Merdon had belonged for 1300 years.&nbsp; It was
probably in consequence of his pleading that Wriothesley restored the
manor, but when Gardiner was illegally deposed by the regency of Edward
VI. on 14th February 1550, John Poynet, a considerable scholar, but
a man of disgraceful life, obtained the appointment to the see, by alienating
various estates to the Seymour family, and Merdon was resumed by the
Crown.&nbsp; It was then granted to Sir Philip Hobby who had been one
of King Henry&rsquo;s privy councillors, and had been sent on an embassy
to Portugal, attended by ten gentlemen of his own retinue, wearing velvet
coats with chains of gold.</p>
<p>Already had come to the hamlet of Slackstead in Hursley Parish another
reformer, Thomas Sternhold, who had been gentleman of the bed-chamber
to Henry VIII., and had put thirty-seven Psalms into English verse,
in hopes of improving the morals of the Court.&nbsp; John Hopkins and
Robert Wisdom completed the translation of the Psalms, which Fuller
in his history says was at first derided and scoffed at as piety rather
than poetry, adding that the good gentleman had drunk more of Jordan
than of Helicon.&nbsp; In his <i>Worthies</i>, however, he says: &ldquo;He
was afterwards (saith my author) <i>ab intimo cubiculo</i> to King Edward
the Sixth; though I am not satisfied whether thereby he meant gentleman
of his privy chamber or groom of his bed-chamber.&nbsp; He was a principal
instrument of translating the Psalms into English metre; the first twenty-six
(and seven-and-thirty in all) <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28">{28}</a>
being by him performed.&nbsp; Yet had he other assistance in that work.&nbsp;
Many a bitter scoff hath since been passed on their endeavours by some
wits, which might have been better employed.&nbsp; Some have miscalled
these their translations <i>Geneva gigs</i> (<i>i.e</i>. jigs); and
which is the worst, father (or mother rather) the expression on our
virgin queen, as falsely as other things have been charged upon her.&nbsp;
Some have not sticked to say &lsquo;that David hath been as much persecuted
by bungling translators as by Saul himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some have made
libellous verses in abuse of them, and no wonder if songs were made
on the translators of the Psalms, seeing drunkards made them on David
the author thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let these translations be beheld by impartial eyes, and
they will be allowed to go in equipage with the best poems in that age.&nbsp;
However, it were to be wished that some bald rhymes therein were bettered;
till which time, such as sing them must endeavour to amend them by singing
them with understanding heads and gracious hearts, whereby that which
is bad metre on earth will be made good music in heaven.&nbsp; As for
our Thomas Sternhold, it was happy for him that he died before his good
master, anno 1549, in the month of August; so probably preventing much
persecution which had happened unto him if surviving in the reign of
Queen Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was Fuller&rsquo;s judgment and that of the author he quotes,
nevertheless the version of the Psalms, being printed with the Prayer-Book,
took such a strong hold of the nation that in 1798 Hannah More was accused
of dissent, because the version of Tate and Brady was used in her schools.&nbsp;
Mr. Keble preferred it to this latter as more like the Hebrew, and some
of his versions (curiously enough proceeding from the same parish) remind
us of these simple old translators.&nbsp; The Old Hundredth, and in
some degree the 23rd and the opening of the 18th, still hold their place,
probably in virtue of the music to which they are wedded.</p>
<p>Bishop Gardiner recovered the Manor of Merdon, with his liberty,
on Queen Mary&rsquo;s accession.&nbsp; Then it was that Philip of Spain
rode through one of these villages, probably Otterbourne, soaked through
with rain, on his way to his ill-starred marriage with Mary.</p>
<p>Gardiner was no persecutor, and Sternhold&rsquo;s widow lived on
at Slackstede.&nbsp; On his death, Queen Mary gave the diocese to John
White, the same who preached to Elizabeth on a living dog being better
than a dead lion.</p>
<p>Hobby then claimed the manor, but Bishop White made a strenuous resistance,
appealing to Gardiner&rsquo;s former plea, and supported by the Attorney
General Story, who is said to have been an enemy of Sir Philip Hobby.&nbsp;
The case was argued in the House of Lords, and given against the bishop,
though under the protest of several of the Lords Spiritual, who dreaded
the like treatment.</p>
<p>Story was prosecuted by the Commons for pleading before the Lords,
fled to the Netherlands and was trepanned on board an English ship,
and put to death as a traitor.</p>
<p>Bishop White was deprived the next year, and retired to his sister&rsquo;s
house at South Warnborough, where he died.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth is
said to have visited him.</p>
<p>Merdon was thus in 1558 for ever alienated from the diocese of Winchester.&nbsp;
Sir Philip Hobby is said to have first built the Lodge, as it was called,
of Hursley Park, about a quarter of a mile from Merdon Castle, which
had become ruinous.&nbsp; Those were the days when the massive walls
and minute comfortless chambers were deserted, defence being less thought
of than convenience in our happy country; and indeed Sir Philip seems
to have used Hursley as a residence instead of only a shelter on a tour.&nbsp;
He died at Bisham aged 53, on the 31st of May 1558, soon after his victory
over the See of Winchester, and is there buried, as well as his elder
brother, Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He left no children, and was succeeded by
his brother William, who had married the widow of Sternhold.&nbsp; On
her death the following memorial was erected over a stone bearing the
coat, &ldquo;On a chevron embattled, between three griffins&rsquo; heads
erased, three roses; and on a brass the inscription:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever chaste or honest godly lyfe<br />Myght

cald by name<br />From whome alas . to sone for hers here left<br />Hath
God her Soule . deth her lyfe byreft,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anno 1559.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>His property at Hursley descended to his son Giles Hobby, Esq., who,
it appears clearly by the register and other records, was living in
the parish very early in the seventeenth century.&nbsp; His last wife
was Ann, the daughter of Sir Thomas Clarke, Knight of Avyngton <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32">{32}</a>
in Berkshire, to whom he sold the castle and manor of Merdon, reserving,
however to himself and wife, a life-holding in the lodge and park.&nbsp;
When this sale was made does not appear, but it is supposed to have
been before the year 1602, as Sir Thomas was then living at Merdon,
and his son married in that year at Hursley.&nbsp; Giles Hobby died
in the year 1626, and his wife in 1630.&nbsp; They were both buried
at Hursley, probably in the church, but no monument appears to have
been erected to their memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas Clarke may be considered as the next lord of Merdon,
though he was never in possession of either the lodge or the park, and
held only for a few years what he did possess.&nbsp; So long, however,
as he continued proprietor of the manor, it is said that he lived at
<i>Merdon</i>, I suppose at the castle, a part of which was probably
then standing and habitable.&nbsp; Sir Thomas, it would seem, kept the
demesne lands in his own occupation, requiring the tenants or copyholders
of the manor, according to ancient usage, to perform the customary service
of reaping and housing his crops: (1) The days employed in this service
were called Haydobyn days; (2) and during their continuance the lord
was obliged to provide breakfast and dinner for the workmen.&nbsp; Richard
Morley, in his Manuscript, gives a very curious account of a quarrel
which occurred on one of these occasions. &lsquo;Another time&rsquo;
(says he) &lsquo;upon a haydobyn-day (320 or 340 reapers) the cart brought
a-field for them a hogs-head of porridge, which stunk and had worms
swimming in it.&nbsp; The reapers refused to work without better provisions.&nbsp;
Mr. Coram of Cranbury would not suffer them to work.&nbsp; Mr. Pye,
Sir Thomas Clarke&rsquo;s steward, and Coram drew their daggers, and
rode at each other through the wheat.&nbsp; At last Lady Clarke promised
to dress for them two or three hogs of bacon: twenty nobles&rsquo; work
lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; He adds, that &lsquo;a heire (hire) went for a man
on the haydobyn-days, if able to carry a hooke a-field.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;haydobyn&rdquo; is supposed by Mr. Marsh to be a corruption
of the old word &ldquo;haydogtime,&rdquo; <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34">{34}</a>
a word signifying a country dance.&nbsp; It seems that when the tenants
were called on to perform work in hedging, reaping, or hay-making, upon
the lands of the lord of the manor, in lieu of money rent he was bound
to feed them through the day, and generally to conclude with a merry-making.&nbsp;
So, no doubt, it had been in the good old days of the bishops and the
much loved and lamented John Bowland; but harder times had come with
Sir Thomas Clarke, when it required the interference of Mr. Coram of
Cranbury to secure them even an eatable meal.&nbsp; No doubt such stout
English resistance saved the days of compulsory labour from becoming
a burden intolerable as in France.</p>
<p>Roger Coram, gent., rented Cranbury at &pound;17: 2s.&nbsp; Cranbury
is a low wooded hill, then part of the manor of Merdon, nearly two miles
to the south-east of Hursley, and in that parish, though nearer to Otterbourne.&nbsp;
Several tenements seem to have been there, those in the valley being
called Long Moor and Pot Kiln.&nbsp; Shoveller is the first name connected
with Cranbury, but Mr. Roger Coram, the champion of the haymakers, held
it till his death, when it passed to Sir Edward Richards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Brambridge, which stands in Twyford parish, but
held part of the hundred of Boyatt in Otterbourne, was in the hands
of the Roman Catholic family of Welles, who seem to have had numerous
retainers at Highbridge, Allbrook, and Boyatt.&nbsp; Swithun Welles
made Brambridge a refuge for priests, and two or three masses were said
in his house each day.&nbsp; One &ldquo;Ben Beard,&rdquo; a spy, writes
in 1584 that if certain priests were not at Brambridge they would probably
be at Mr. Strange&rsquo;s at Mapledurham, where was a hollow place by
the livery cupboard capable of containing two men.</p>
<p>Swithun Welles went later to London and took a house in Holborn,
where Topcliffe the priest-catcher broke in on Father Genings saying
mass, and both he and Mr. Welles were hanged together for what was adjudged
in those days to be a treasonable offence, implying disaffection to
the Queen. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36">{36}</a></p>
<p>The modern house of Brambridge affords no priests&rsquo; chambers.&nbsp;
It is believed that an older one was burnt down, and there is a very
dim report that a priest was drowned in a stone basin in a neighbouring
wood.</p>
<p>The register of Twyford Church contains the record of a number of
the Welles family buried in the churchyard clandestinely, by night.&nbsp;
John Wells, mentioned in the Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis as an able man
living at Deptford, retired to Brambridge, and died there in 1634.&nbsp;
This accounts for there having been the Roman Catholic school at Twyford,
whence Alexander Pope was expelled for some satirical verses on the
master.&nbsp; The house is still known.</p>
<p>The vicars of Hursley at this period were John Hynton, presented
by Bishop Gardiner, but deprived in on account of his tenets.&nbsp;
Richard Fox was presented in his place by William Hobby.&nbsp; It must
have been owing to the reforming zeal of this vicar of Hursley that
the frescoes in Otterbourne Church were as far as possible effaced,
white-washed over, and the Ten Commandments painted over them in old
English lettering, part of which was still legible in 1839.&nbsp; Otterbourne
was apparently still served by the vicar of Hursley or his assistant.</p>
<p>Parish Registers began at this date, and here are the remarkable
occurrences recorded at Hursley:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>EXTRAORDINARY OCCURRENCES, ETC.</p>
<p>1582.&nbsp; A great hail storm happened at Hursley, Baddesley, and
in the neighbourhood, this year.&nbsp; The hail-stones measured nine
inches in circumference.</p>
<p>1604.&nbsp; The plague made its appearance at Anfield.&nbsp; It broke
out in November, and continued till the following February.&nbsp; Many
persons died of it, and were not brought to the church, but buried in
the waste near their residence.</p>
<p>1610.&nbsp; A person of the name of Wooll hanged himself at Gosport,
in the parish of Hursley, about this time.&nbsp; He was buried at the
corner of Newland&rsquo;s Coppice, and a stake was driven through his
body.&nbsp; (The place still bears the name of Newland&rsquo;s Coppice.)</p>
<p>1621.&nbsp; A planked thrashing-floor first laid down in the parish
this year, viz. at Merdon.&nbsp; Chalk-floors used before.&nbsp; It
was reckoned a memorable improvement.</p>
<p>1629.&nbsp; A great fall of snow in October.&nbsp; It was nearly
half a foot deep, and remained on the ground three or four days.</p>
<p>1635.&nbsp; A copyholder was hanged for murder this year.&nbsp; His
copyhold was seized by the lord as forfeited, but afterwards recovered,
viz. in 1664.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IV - PURITAN TIMES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>After his dispute with the haymakers, Sir Thomas Clarke sold Merdon
to William Brock, a lawyer, from whom it passed to John Arundel, and
then to Sir Nathanael Napier, whose son, Sir Gerald, parted with it
again to Richard Maijor, the son of the mayor of Southampton.&nbsp;
This was in 1638, and for some time the lodge at Hursley was lent to
Mr. Kingswell, Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s father-in-law, who died there in 1639,
after which time Mr. Maijor took up his abode there.&nbsp; He seems
to have been a shrewd, active man, and a staunch Protestant, for when
there was a desire to lease out Cranbury, he, as Lord of the Manor,
stipulated that it should be let only to a Protestant of the Church
of England, not to a Papist.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of the Welleses
at Brambridge probably moved him to make this condition.</p>
<p>The person who applied for the lease was Dr. John Young, Dean of
Winchester, who purchased the copyhold of Cranbury before 1643, and
retired thither when he was expelled from his deanery and other preferments
in the evil times of the Commonwealth, and there died, leaving his widow
in possession.</p>
<p>Whether the lady was molested by Mr. Maijor we do not know.&nbsp;
He was no favourite with Richard Morley, who rented the forge in Hursley,
the farm of Ratlake and Anvyle, as Ampfield was then spelt, and thought
him a severe lord to his copyholders.&nbsp; Morley was born at Hursley,
and was sent to school at Baddesley in 1582, the year of the great hailstorm
of the nine-inch stones.&nbsp; He kept valuable memoranda, which Mr.
Marsh quotes, and died in 1672, when he is registered as:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ricardus Morley Senex sepultus fuit, August 1672.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>Senex</i> indeed, for he must have been 97.)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Of Maijor, Morley records, &ldquo;He was very witty and thrifty,
and got more by oppressing his tenants than did all the lords in 60
years before him.&nbsp; He was a justice of the peace, and raised a
troop in the cause of the Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must have been
in the army that Oliver Cromwell made his acquaintance, and in 1647
began the first proposals of a &ldquo;Marriage treaty,&rdquo; between
Richard, Oliver&rsquo;s eldest surviving son, just twenty-one and educated
for the Law, and the elder daughter of Mr. Maijor (which Carlyle always
spells as Mayor).&nbsp; For the time, however, this passed off; but,
apparently under the direction of Mr. Robertson, a minister of Southampton,
and Mr. Stapylton, also a minister, the treaty was resumed; and three
weeks after the King&rsquo;s execution, Oliver wrote to Mr. Maijor.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>For my very worthy friend, Richard Mayor, Esq.: These.</p>
<p>LONDON, 12<i>th February</i> 1648.</p>
<p>SIR - I received some intimations formerly, and by the last return
from Southampton a Letter from Mr. Robinson, concerning the reviving
of the last year&rsquo;s motion, touching my Son and your Daughter.&nbsp;
Mr. Robinson was also pleased to send enclosed in his, a Letter from
you, bearing date the 5th of this instant, February, wherein I find
your willingness to entertain any good means for the completing of that
business.</p>
<p>From whence I take encouragement to send my Son to wait upon you;
and by him to let you know, that my desires are, if Providence so dispose,
very full and free to the thing, - if upon an interview, there prove
also a freedom in the young persons thereunto.&nbsp; What liberty you
will give herein, I wholly submit to you.&nbsp; I thought fit, in my
Letter to Mr. Robinson, to mention somewhat of expedition because indeed
I know not how soon I may be called into the field, or other occasions
may remove me from hence; having for the present some liberty of stay
in London.&nbsp; The Lord direct all to His glory. - I rest, Sir, your
very humble servant,</p>
<p>OLIVER CROMWELL.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Probably this was the time when the public-house of Hursley took
the name of &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; which it has kept to
the present day.&nbsp; But young Cromwell was inclined to loyalty, and
when at Cambridge used to drink &ldquo;to the health of our landlord,&rdquo;
meaning the King!&nbsp; He was one-and-twenty when, with his father&rsquo;s
friend Mr. Stapylton, he made a visit to Hursley, and was received by
Mr. and Mrs. Maijor with many civilities, also seeing their two daughters,
Dorothy and Anne.&nbsp; In a letter of 28th February, Cromwell thanks
Mr. Maijor for &ldquo;The reception of my son, in the liberty given
him to wait on your worthy daughter, the report of whose virtues and
godliness has so great a place in my heart that I think fit not to neglect
anything on my part which may consummate a close of the business, if
God please to dispose the young ones&rsquo; hearts thereunto, and other
suitable ordering of affairs towards mutual satisfaction appear in the
dispensation of Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stapylton was commissioned to act for General Cromwell in the
matter of settlements, over which there was considerable haggling, though
Oliver writes that &ldquo;the report of the young lady&rsquo;s godliness
causeth him to deny himself in the matter of moneys.&rdquo;&nbsp; More
correspondence ensued, as to the settlement of Hursley upon Dorothy
and her heirs male, and the compensation to her younger sister Anne.&nbsp;
Cromwell was anxious to hurry on the matter so as to have it concluded
before his departure to take the command in Ireland.</p>
<p>The terms were finally settled, and Richard and Dorothy were married
at Hursley on May Day, 1649, before Cromwell&rsquo;s departure to crush
the ill-arranged risings in Ireland.&nbsp; Her sister Anne shortly after
married John Dunch of Baddesley, with &pound;1000 as her portion.&nbsp;
Morley of Baddesley chronicles the marriage in no friendly tone: &ldquo;When&rdquo;
(says he) &ldquo;King Charles was put to death, and Oliver Cromwell
Protector of England, and Richard Maijor of his privy council, and Noll
his eldest son Richard married to Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s daughter Doll,
then Mr. Maijor did usurp authority over his tenants at Hursley.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In another place he says that &ldquo;he&rdquo; (<i>i.e</i>. Mr. Maijor)
&ldquo;set forth horse and man for the Parliament, and was a captain
and justice of peace.&nbsp; Lord Richard Cromwell was also a justice
of peace, and John Dunch a captain and justice.&nbsp; These all lived
at Lodge together in Oliver&rsquo;s reign; so we had justice right or
wrong by power; for if we did offend, they had power to send us a thousand
miles off, and that they have told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard, having no turn for politics or warfare, preferred to live
a quiet life with his father-in-law, in the lodge.&nbsp; There were
two walnut avenues planted about this time, leading to the lodge from
the churchyard on one side, and on the other towards Baddesley; and
the foundations of the house can still be traced on the lawn to which
both lead.</p>
<p>Oliver writes in the summer after the marriage that he is glad the
young people have leisure to make a journey to eat cherries.&nbsp; There
is little doubt but that this must have been to the gardens in Ram-Alley
near Chandler&rsquo;s Ford, originally Chaloner&rsquo;s Ford, where
numerous trees, bearing quantities of little black cherries called merries,
used to grow, and where parties used to go as a Sunday diversion, and
eat, before the days of the station and the building.</p>
<p>The elder Mrs. Cromwell paid a visit to Hursley after parting with
the Protector on his voyage to Ireland; but he never seems to have gone
thither in person, though he wrote kindly paternal letters to his son
and daughter.&nbsp; He wishes Richard to study mathematics and cosmography,
and read history, especially Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is a Body of history, and will add much more to your understanding than
fragments of story.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to Dorothy, he gives advice on
her health and religious habits.</p>
<p>John Hardy had been Vicar of Hursley but was expelled, and Mr. Maijor,
as patron of the living, provided persons for the ministry and kept
a close account of their expenses, which is still preserved.&nbsp; Seven
different ministers in the half year after Christmas 1645 were remunerated
&ldquo;for travell and pains in preaching,&rdquo; after which time Mr.
Richard Webb settled for a time at Hursley, and Mr. Daniel Lloyd at
Otterbourne, though several more changes took place.</p>
<p>A parish register at Hursley, 1653, recording births (not baptisms),
mentions the opening of a chalk-pit at Hatchgate in 1655, and at Otterbourne.&nbsp;
The children of William Downe of Otterbourne Farm are distinguished

<p>Oliver Cromwell, according to an old village tradition, sunk his
treasure at the bottom of Merdon Well, in an iron chest which must have
been enchanted, for, on an endeavour to draw it up, no one was to speak.&nbsp;
One workman unfortunately said, &ldquo;Here it comes,&rdquo; when it
immediately sank to the bottom and (this is quite certain) never was
seen!&nbsp; The well was cleaned out in later times, and nothing was
found but a pair of curious pattens, cut away to receive a high-heeled
shoe, also a mazer-bowl, an iron flesh-hook and small cooking-pot, and
a multitude of pins, thrown in to make the curious reverberating sound
when, after several seconds, they reached the water.&nbsp; A couple
of ducks are said to have been thrown down, and to have emerged at Pool
hole at Otterbourne with their feathers scraped off.</p>
<p>On 3rd September 1658, the family party at Hursley was broken up
by the unexpected death of the Protector.&nbsp; He was not yet sixty
years of age, and had not contemplated being cut off before affairs
were more settled; and when, in his last moments, he was harassed with
enquiries as to his successor, he answered, &ldquo;You will find my
will in <i>such</i> a drawer of my cabinet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of his
counsellors thought he named his son Richard; and no one ever found
the drawer with the will in it, in which it was thought that his son-in-law
Fleetwood, a much abler man, was named.</p>
<p>At any rate, Richard was accepted in his father&rsquo;s place by
Parliament and army, and went to much expense for the Protector&rsquo;s
funeral.&nbsp; It must have been a great misfortune to him that his
shrewd father-in-law, the witty and thrifty Mr. Maijor, was sinking
under a complication of incurable diseases, of which Morley speaks somewhat
unkindly, and he died in the end of April 1660.</p>
<p>Richard had never been a strong partisan of the Commonwealth, though
he had quietly submitted to whatever was required of him.&nbsp; He had
been member of Parliament for the county of Hants, and had been placed
at the head of the list of his father&rsquo;s attempt at a House of
Lords, and he allowed greatness to be thrust on him in a quiet acquiescent
way.&nbsp; He dismissed the fictitious parliament that his father had
summoned, and then offended the strict and godly of the army by promoting
soldiers of whom they disapproved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is Dick Ingoldsby,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;he can neither pray nor preach, and yet I trust him
before you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had any real enthusiasm for the harmless, helpless man, &ldquo;the
phantom king of half a year&rdquo;; and it was just as old Mr. Maijor
was dying that Richard was requested by the &ldquo;Rump&rdquo; to resign,
and return to Hampton Court, with the promise of a pension and of payment
of the debts incurred by his father.&nbsp; While packing for his departure,
he sat down on a box containing all the complimentary addresses made
to him, and said, &ldquo;Between my legs lie the lives and fortunes
of all the good folk in England!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then returned to Hursley,
where he found himself pursued by those debts of his father which the
Long Parliament had engaged to pay, and which swallowed up more than
his patrimony, though the manor of Merdon, having been settled upon
his wife, could not be touched.&nbsp; He was sufficiently alarmed, however,
to make him retreat to the continent and change his name to Clarke.</p>
<p>In 1675 Mrs. Richard Cromwell died, leaving out of a numerous family
only one son and two daughters.&nbsp; The son, Oliver, inherited the
estates, and seems to have been on good terms with his father, who,
in 1700, came to live at Cheshunt under his name of Clarke, and made
some visits to Hursley.&nbsp; Richard married under this assumed name,
and left some children.</p>
<p>When Oliver died without heirs in 1706, his father Richard, according
to the original settlement, succeeded to the property, but his two daughters
set up their claim, and the case was brought into court.&nbsp; It is
said that the judge was Cowper, but this has been denied.&nbsp; At any
rate the judge seems to have been shocked at the undutiful litigation,
and treated the old man with much respect.</p>
<p>The case was decided in his favour, and he lived between Hursley
and Cheshunt till his death in 1712 in his 86th year.</p>
<p>As Mr. Palgrave writes:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him count we wise,<br />Him also, though the chorus
of the throng<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be silent, though no pillar rise<br />In
slavish adulation of the strong,<br />But here, from blame of tongues
and fame aloof,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath a low chancel roof,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of God<br />He sleeps; unconscious hero!&nbsp;
Lowly grave<br />By village footsteps daily trod;<br />Unconscious!
or while silence holds the nave,<br />And the bold robin comes, when
day is dim,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pipes his heedless hymn.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These are a poet&rsquo;s meditations on him, more graceful than the
inscription on the monument erected to him by his two undutiful daughters,
ere, in 1718, they sold the estate.&nbsp; It was a large tablet of marble,
surmounted by death&rsquo;s heads.&nbsp; It is of gray or veined marble,
in the Doric style of architecture, and is in height thirteen feet,
and in breadth nearly nine.&nbsp; The inscription upon it is as follows:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This Monument was erected to the memory of Mrs. Eliz. Cromwell, spinster
(by Mr. Richard Cromwell and Thomas Cromwell, her executors).&nbsp;
She died the 8th day of April 1731, in the 82d yeare of her age, and
lyes interred near this place; she was the daughter of Richard Cromwell,
Esq., by Dorothy, his wife, who was the daughter of Richard Maijor,
Esq.&nbsp; And the following account of her family (all of whom, except
Mrs. Ann Gibson, lie in this chancel) is given according to her desire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ann Gibson, the 6th daughter, died 7th Dec. 1727, in the 69th
year of her age, and lies interred, with Dr. Thomas Gibson, her husband,
Physician General of the Army, in the church-yard belonging to St. George&rsquo;s
Chapel, in London.</p>
<p>Richard Cromwell, Esq., father of the said Eliz. Cromwell, died 12th
July 1712, in the 86th year of his age.</p>
<p>Oliver Cromwell, Esq., son of the said Richard Cromwell, died 11th
May 1705, in the 49th year of his age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dorothy Mortimer, a seventh daughter, wife of John Mortimer,
Esq., died 14th May 1681, in the 21st year of her age, but left no issue.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dorothy Cromwell, wife of the said Richard Cromwell, died 5th
January 1675, in the 49th year of her age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ann Maijor, mother of the said Mrs. Dorothy Cromwell, died 13th

<p>A fourth daughter died 27th May 1655, in the 1st year of her age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Cromwell, a third daughter, died 24th September 1654, in

<p>A son of the said Richard and Dorothy Cromwell, died 13th December
1652, in the 1st year of his age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ann Cromwell, a second daughter, died 14th March 1651, in the
1st year of her age.</p>

March 1639.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The lime-trees, beautifully surrounding the churchyard, are said
to have been planted by Richard Cromwell, and there was certainly an
excellent fashion of planting them in the latter end of the seventeenth
century, partly due to a French custom, partly to Evelyn&rsquo;s <i>Sylva</i>.&nbsp;
The beautiful avenue of limes at Brambridge, in three aisles, was probably
planted at this date by one of the Welles family.</p>
<p>In taking down the old lodge of Merdon or Hursley, a large lump of
metal was found, squeezed into a crevice of the wall, and was sold by
Mr. Heathcote as a Roman weight; but on being cleaned, it proved to
be the die of the seal of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; Richard had caused
a new seal to be made for himself by Simon, a noted medallist, and he
had probably thus disposed of the die as a dangerous possession.&nbsp;
Mr. Vertue saw it in 1710, in the collection of a Mr. Roberts, but it
has since disappeared.</p>
<p>There was a stone inscribed to Edward Reynell and Mary his wife,
who died respectively in 1698 and 1699.&nbsp; They are believed to have
been friends of Oliver Cromwell the grandson, who certainly named them
in his will.&nbsp; There was a tradition in Hursley that this Reynell
was actually the executioner of King Charles.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER V - CUSTOMS OF THE MANOR OF MERDON</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As it was just at this time that the customs of the manor of Merdon
were revised, this seems to be the fittest place for giving Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s
summary of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quantity of land in cultivation within the Manor of Merdon
or parish of Hursley is, as I imagine, not less than three-fifths of
the whole, or about 6000 acres; of which the greater part was anciently
copyhold, under the Bishop and Church of Winchester.&nbsp; The tenure
by which it was held, was, and indeed is still, that denominated <i>Borough
English</i>, the most singular custom of which is, that the <i>youngest</i>
son inherits the copyhold of his father, in preference of all his elder
brothers.&nbsp; The origin of this tenure, according to Sir William
Blackstone, is very remote, it being his opinion that it was &lsquo;a
remnant of Saxon liberty&rsquo;; <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53">{53}</a>
and was so named in contradistinction to the Norman customs, afterwards
introduced by the Conqueror, from the Duchy of Normandy.&nbsp; The reasons
commonly assigned for the peculiar usage just mentioned are given by
Blackstone, but they are evidently not satisfactory to him, and, as
it should seem, not founded on truth.&nbsp; His own way of accounting
for it is far more rational and probable, though, it must be confessed,
it is only conjectural.&nbsp; He supposes that the ancient inhabitants
of this island were for the most part herdsmen and shepherds; that their
elder sons, as soon as they arrived at manhood, received from their
father a certain allotment of cattle, and removed from him, and that
the youngest son, who continued to the last with him, became naturally
the heir of the family and of the remaining property.&nbsp; Whether
this were really the case or not will probably ever remain a question
of great uncertainty; and it is a circumstance of too trifling a nature
to deserve much investigation.&nbsp; It is, however, worthy of remark
that to this day this custom of descent to the youngest son prevails
among the Tartars; and that something very like it was anciently the
usage among most northern nations. <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54">{54}</a>&nbsp;
But whatever be its origin, or in whatever way it be accounted for,
such is the custom now existing in this manor; and I have had frequent
opportunities of observing that it is held, especially by the inferior
class of copyholders, as sacred, and that they would, on no consideration,
divert their tenements out of the customary order of inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;But besides this custom, there are others also in this
manor which indicate great antiquity, and which, there can be but little
if any doubt, are the same as were in use before the Norman Conquest.&nbsp;
We are told, indeed, by Judge Blackstone, that after that event the
ancient Saxon system of tenure was laid aside, and that the Normans,
wherever they had lands granted to them, introduced the feodal system;
and that at length it was adopted generally, and as constitutional,
throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; There does not, however, I think, appear
to be sufficient reason for supposing that this new system was received
into this manor, the customs here in use being evidently those of a
more remote age, and in their <i>circumstances</i>, if not in their
<i>nature</i>, altogether unlike those which were at this time established
by the Normans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the feodal system, the tenant originally held his lands
entirely at the will of the lord, and at his death they reverted to
the lord again.&nbsp; The services to be performed for the lord were
uncertain and unlimited.&nbsp; The copyhold was also subject to a variety
of grievous taxes, which the lord had the privilege, upon many occasions,
of imposing - such as aids, reliefs, primer seisin, wardship, escheats
for felony and want of heirs, and many more, altogether so exorbitant
and oppressive as often totally to ruin the tenant and rob him of almost
all interest in his property. <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56">{56}</a>&nbsp;
The difference of the circumstances under which the lands in the manor
of Merdon are, and, as it seems, always were held, is remarkably striking:
here the copyhold is hereditary, the services are certain and limited,
the fines are fixed and unchangeable, the lord has no right of wardship,
neither is the copyhold liable to escheat for felony; the widow of a
tenant has also a right of inheritance, and the tenement may be let
without the lord&rsquo;s consent for a year.&nbsp; All which circumstances
appear to bespeak an original and fundamental difference of tenure from
that of the feodal system, and are, I presume, to be considered, not
as encroachments that have gradually grown upon that system, but as
being of a more liberal extraction and much greater antiquity. <a name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a">{57a}</a>&nbsp;
But besides these differences, the supposition here advanced has this
farther ground to rest upon, viz. that neither the name of <i>Merdon</i>,
nor that of <i>Hursley</i>, is so much as mentioned in the great survey
of the kingdom, called Domesday-Book, which, if the intention of that
survey be rightly understood, <a name="citation57b"></a><a href="#footnote57b">{57b}</a>
it seems next to a certainty that one or other of them would have been
had the new system been here adopted.&nbsp; Nor, when it is considered
that this was <i>Church</i> property, and that in many instances the
alterations were not enforced, <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58">{58}</a>
out of favour as it is supposed to the landholder, who was partial to
the more ancient tenure, ought it to be thought extraordinary that the
customs in this manor did not undergo the general change; since, if
favour were desirable and shown to any, who were so likely to expect
and to find it as the clergy?&nbsp; But however this point may really
be, it appears evident that the tenants of this manor have, from the
earliest times to which we have the means of resorting for information,
enjoyed many unusual rights and immunities, and that their services
were, in many respects, far from being so base and servile as those
of the strictly feodal tenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it was that disputes first arose between the lord and
tenants concerning their respective rights is not, I believe, known
with certainty; but it appears that in the time of Mr. Maijor many of
the lord&rsquo;s claims were complained of by the tenants as usurpations;
as, on the other hand, many of theirs were by the lord as new and uncustomary.&nbsp;
But it was in vain then for the tenants either to resist the lord&rsquo;s
pretensions or to assert their own; such being Mr. Maijor&rsquo;s power
and interest with the Cromwellian Government as to enable him, as they
well knew, easily to defeat all their efforts.&nbsp; In justice, however,
to Mr. Maijor, it should be mentioned that he acted, in one instance
at least, with great liberality towards the tenants; as by him it was
that the customary personal services were commuted for pecuniary payments
- an exchange which could not fail of being peculiarly acceptable to
them, as they were not only relieved by it from a service they considered
as a grievance, and performed reluctantly, but had the prospect of being
in the end great gainers by it.&nbsp; But though by this concession
on the part of the lord some ground of discontent was removed, yet disputes
and animosities still continued to subsist with respect to other customs;
and no sooner was Mr. Maijor dead, and the Cromwell family dispossessed
of its power, than the tenants laid aside their fears and renewed their
opposition.&nbsp; The circumstances of the times being now in their
favour, it might perhaps have been expected that they, in their turn,
should establish all their claims without contention.&nbsp; The case,
however, was quite otherwise, as neither Mrs. Cromwell nor her son would
tamely forego any one of their supposed privileges - on the contrary,
Oliver defended them in the true spirit of a Cromwell, and relinquished
none but such as the decisions of a jury, which were more than once
resorted to, deprived him of.&nbsp; In this state of strife and litigation
things continued until the year 1692, when most of the principal tenants
concurred in a determination to appeal to the Court of Chancery.&nbsp;
A bill of complaint was accordingly presented to the Court, stating
their supposed grievances, and soliciting its interference.&nbsp; Several
hearings and trials, ordered in consequence of this application, for
the investigation of the disputed customs, then ensued; after which,
though not till more than six years had elapsed, the Court finally adjudged
and decreed the customs of the manor to be, and continue for the future,
as they here follow:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 1.&nbsp; That all the copyholds and customary
messuages, lands, and tenements within the said manor are, and have
been time out of mind, copyholds of inheritance, demised and demisable
to the copyholders or customary tenants thereof, and their heirs in
fee simple by copy of Court Roll, according to the custom of the said
manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 2.&nbsp; That the customary tenements within
the said manor do descend, and ought to descend, as tenements of the
tenure, and in the nature of Borough-English, not only to the youngest
son or youngest daughter, and for default of such issue of such customary
tenant to the youngest brother or youngest sister, but also, for default
of such brother and sister of such customary tenant, to the next kinsman
or kinswoman of the whole blood of the customary tenant in possession,
how far so ever remote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 3.&nbsp; That if any tenant of any copyhold
die, seized of any copyhold, his wife living, then she ought to come
to the next Court or Law-day to make her claim and election, whether
she will pay a penny and hold for her widow&rsquo;s estate, or pay half
her husband&rsquo;s fine, and to keep the copyhold tenement during her
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 4.&nbsp; That the husband of any wife (as customary
tenant of the said manor) dying, seized of any customary tenement within
the said manor, is entitled to have such customary tenement of his wife
so dying, during his life, though the said husband had no issue of the
body of his said wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 5.&nbsp; That if any copyholder or customary
tenant of the said manor die, and leave his heir within the age of fourteen
years, that then the nearest of kin and farthest from the land, have
had, and ought to have the guardianship and custody of the body of such
heir and his copyholds, held of that manor, so that at the next Court
or Law-day he come in and challengeth the same, and to keep the same
until the heir come to be of the age of fourteen years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 6.&nbsp; That the heir of any customary tenant
within the said manor is compellable to pay his fine to the lord of
the said manor, and be admitted tenant before he attain his age of one
and twenty years, if he come to the possession of his customary estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 7.&nbsp; That the fine due to the lord of the
said manor upon the admission or alienation of any customary tenant,
to any customary tenement within the said manor, is, and time out of
mind was, double the quit-rent of the said customary tenement; that
is to say, when the quit-rent of any customary tenement was twenty shillings,
the tenant of such tenement did pay to the lord of the said manor forty
shillings for a fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 8.&nbsp; That every heir and tenant of any customary
lands of the said manor may sell his inheritance during the life of
the widow of his ancestor, who enjoys such customary estate for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 9.&nbsp; That it is lawful for any of the copyholders
or customary tenants of the said manor, to let her, his, or their copyholds
for one year, but not for any longer term, without a licence from the
lord of the said manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 10. &lsquo;That no <i>certain</i> fine is payable
to the lord of the said manor from any customary tenant of the said
manor for a licence to let his customary tenement; but such fine may
exceed a penny in the pound of the yearly value of such customary tenement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 11.&nbsp; That every copyholder of inheritance
of the said manor may sell any of his coppices, under-woods, and rows,
and use them at pleasure; and may dig for stone, coal, earth, marle,
chalk, sand and gravel in their own grounds, to be employed thereon;
and may also dig any of the commons or wastes belonging to the said
manor for earth or gravel in the ancient pits there, where their predecessors
have done, for the improvement of their copyholds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 12.&nbsp; That all the customary tenants of
the said manor, when and as often as their old pits, where they used
to dig earth, marle, chalk, sand, clay, gravel, and other mould, were
deficient, and would not yield the same for them, that they, the said
customary tenants, may and have used to dig <i>new</i> pits in any of
the wastes and commons of the lord within the said manor, and there
dig and carry away earth, marle, chalk, sand, clay, gravel, and other
mould at their pleasure, for the improvement of their customary tenements,
or for other necessary uses, without the licence of the lord of the
said manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 13.&nbsp; That the ancient customary tenants
of the said manor (other than such as hold only purpresture lands) have
always had common of pasture and feedings in all the lord&rsquo;s commons
belonging to the said manor, viz. upon Cranbury Common, Hiltingbury

cattle, without number or stint, exclusive of the lord of the said manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 16.&nbsp; That the hazels, furzes, maples, alders,
wythies, crab-trees, fern, and bushes, growing upon the aforesaid wastes
and commons, or in either of them, as also the acorns when they there
fall, do belong to the customary tenants of the said manor, not excluding
the lord of the said manor for the time being from the same.&nbsp; And
that the customary tenants of the said manor have had, and used and
ought to have, right of cutting furzes growing upon the wastes and commons
of the said manor for their firing, and to cut fern for their uses and
that the said customary tenants, in like manner, have right of cutting
thorns, bushes, wythies, hazels, maples, alders, and crab-trees, growing

and a right to the mast there.</p>

not to cut down the said coppices, or one of them altogether, or at

said manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 25.&nbsp; That the said customary tenants, and
every of them, may cut down any old trees, called decayed pollard trees,
standing or growing in or upon his customary tenement, and sell and
dispose of the same, at his and their will and pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Custom</i> 26.&nbsp; That the lord of the said manor for

one farm, or customary tenement, for the necessary repairs of the mansion-house

<p>The boundaries of the manor of Merdon, including Cranbury, and up
to the brook at Chandler&rsquo;s Ford, have been kept up by &ldquo;progresses&rdquo;
round them.&nbsp; Probably the &ldquo;gang&rdquo; or Rogation procession
was discontinued by either Sir Philip Hobby or Richard Maijor; but on
the borders between Hursley and Baddesley, at a spot called High Trees
Corner, near the railway, is marked in the old map, &ldquo;Here stode
Gospell Oke.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not far from Wool&rsquo;s Grave, the
next corner towards the Baddesley road.&nbsp; There, no doubt, the procession
halted for the reading of the Gospel for Rogation week.</p>

<p>A small farm near the church was held by Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, having probably been granted by Bishop Richard Fox, the founder,
who held the See of Winchester from 1500 to 1528.&nbsp; The bearing
in his coat of arms was a &ldquo;pelican in her piety,&rdquo; and the
Pelican was the name of the public house and of the farm that succeeded
it down to the present day.&nbsp; The title as well as that of the college
are of course connected with the emblem of the Pelican feeding her young
from her own breast.&nbsp; Little pelicans, alternately with Tudor portcullises,
profusely adorn Fox&rsquo;s chantry in Winchester Cathedral.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - CRANBURY AND BRAMBRIDGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Great changes began at the Restoration.&nbsp; Robert Maunder became
vicar of Hursley in 1660, on whose presentation is unknown; but that
he or his curate were scholars is probable, since the entries in the
parish registers both of Hursley and Otterbourne begin to be in Latin.&nbsp;
Cranbury had passed from Dean Young to his brother Major General Young,
and from him to his daughter, the wife or Sir Charles Wyndham, son of
Sir Edmund Wyndham, Knight Marshall of England and a zealous cavalier.&nbsp;
Brambridge, closely bordering on Otterbourne, on the opposite side of
the Itchen, though in Twyford Parish, was in the possession of the Welles
family.&nbsp; Brambridge and Otterbourne are divided from one another
by the river Itchen, a clear and beautiful trout stream, much esteemed
by fishermen.&nbsp; In the early years of Charles II. a canal was dug,
beside the Itchen, for the conveyance of coal from Southampton.&nbsp;
It was one of the first formed in England, and for two hundred years
was constantly used by barges.&nbsp; The irrigation of the meadows was
also much benefited, broad ditches being formed - &ldquo;water carriages&rdquo;
as they are locally called - which conduct the streams in turn over
the grass, so that even a dry season causes no drought, but they always
lie green and fresh while the hills above are burnt brown.</p>
<p>Another work was set in hand during the reign of Charles II., namely
the palace he designed to build in rivalry of Versailles.&nbsp; Sir
Christopher Wren was the architect.&nbsp; The grounds were intended
to stretch over the downs to a great distance, and on the highest point
was to stand a pharos, whose light would be visible from the Solent.&nbsp;
Fountains were to be fed from the Itchen, and a magnificent palace was
actually begun, the bricks for it being dug from a clay pit at Otterbourne,
which has ever since borne the name of Dell Copse, and became noted
for the growth of daffodils.&nbsp; The king lodged at Southampton to
inspect the work, and there is a tradition (derived from Dean Rennell)
that being an excellent walker, he went on foot to Winchester.&nbsp;
One of his gentlemen annoyed him by a hint to the country people as
to who he was, whereupon a throng come out to stare at him, at one of
the bridges.&nbsp; He escaped, and took his revenge by a flying leap
over a broad &ldquo;water carriage,&rdquo; leaving them to follow as
they could.</p>
<p>His death put an end to his design, when only one wing of the building
was completed.&nbsp; It was known as &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s House&rdquo;
and was used as barracks till 1892, when it was unfortunately burnt
to the ground.</p>
<p>Boyat, or Bovi&egrave;res, as it once was called, had been a &ldquo;hundred,&rdquo;
and was probably more of a village than at present, since up to 1840
there was a pound and stocks opposite to the single farm-house that
remained.&nbsp; The lands stretched from the hill to the river, near
which was a hamlet called Highbridge, just on the boundary between Twyford
and Otterbourne.&nbsp; Here was an endowed Roman Catholic chapel, a
mere brick building, at the back of a cottage, only distinguished by
a little cross on the roof.&nbsp; There is reason to think that a good
many dependants of the Brambridge family lived here, for there are entries
in the parish register that infants had been born at Highbridge, but
the curate of Otterbourne could not tell whether they had been baptized.</p>
<p>A new parchment parish register was provided in 1690, and very carefully
kept by the curate, John Newcombe, who yearly showed it up to the magistrates
at the Petty Sessions, when it was signed by two of them.&nbsp; A certain
Augustin Thomas was a man of some property, comprising a house and two
or three fields, which were known as &ldquo;Thomas&rsquo;s Bargain,&rdquo;
till one was used as a site for the Vicarage.&nbsp; Several surnames
still extant in the parish are found in the register, Cox, Comley, Collins,
Goodchild, Woods, Wareham - Anne and Abraham were the twin children
of John and Anne Diddams, a curious connection with the name Didymus
(twin), which seems to be the origin.</p>
<p>There must have been extensive repairs, if such they may be called,
of the church, probably under the influence of Sir Charles and Lady
Wyndham - for though Cranbury House stands in Hursley parish, it is
so much nearer to Otterbourne that the inhabitants generally attend
the church there, - and two huge square pews in the chancel, one lined
with red baize, the other bare, were appropriated to Cranbury, and might
well have been filled by the children of Sir Charles and Dame James
his wife - Jacoba in her marriage register at Hursley - for they had
no less than seventeen children, of whom only five died in infancy,
a small proportion in those days of infant mortality.&nbsp; The period
of alteration is fixed by a great square board bearing the royal arms,
with the initials W. and M. and the date 1687.&nbsp; No notice was taken
of the Nassau shield, and indeed it must have been put up in a burst
of enthusiasm for the glorious Revolution, for the lion, as best he
can be recollected, had a most exultant expression, with his tongue
out of one side of his mouth.</p>
<p>The black-letter Commandments on the chancel arch were whitewashed
out, and a tablet in blue with gold lettering erected in their stead
on each side of the altar.&nbsp; The east window had either then or
previously been deprived of all its tracery, and was an expanse of plain
glass with only a little remains of a cusp at the top of the arch.&nbsp;
The bells were in one of the true Hampshire weather-boarded square towers,
of which very few still exist in their picturesqueness.&nbsp; There
were the remains of an old broken font, and a neat white marble one,
of which the tradition was that it was given by a parish clerk named
David Fidler, and it still exists as the lining of the present font.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Wyndham died in 1706, his wife in 1720.&nbsp; A small
monument was raised for them in Hursley Church, with an inscription
on a tablet now in the tower, purporting that the erection was by their
daughters, Frances White and Beata Hall.</p>
<p>Frances was married to a man of some note in his day, to judge by
the monument she erected to his memory in Milton Church, near Lymington,
where his effigy appears, an upright figure cut off at the knees, and
in addition to the sword in his hand there is a metal one, with a blade
waved like a Malay crease, by the side of the monument.&nbsp; The inscription
is thus -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>THOMAS WHITE Esq., son of</p>
<p>IGNATIUS WHITE Esq. of Fiddleford in Dorsetshire.</p>
<p>He served three kings and Queen Ann as a Commander in the guards,
and was much wounded.&nbsp; He was in the wars of Ireland and Flanders.</p>
<p>He had one son who dyed before him.&nbsp; He departed this life on
the 17th of February in the year 1720.</p>
<p>This monument was erected by his widow Frances, one of the daughters
of Sir Charles Wyndham, in the county of Southampton.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mrs. White thus lost her husband and her mother in the course of
the same year.&nbsp; Her brother sold the Cranbury property to Jonathan
Conduitt, Esquire, who was a noted person in his day.&nbsp; He married
Catherine Barton, the favourite niece and adopted daughter of Sir Isaac
Newton.&nbsp; It may be remembered that this great man was a posthumous
child, and was bred up by his mother&rsquo;s second husband, Barnabas
Smith, Rector of North Witham, Lincolnshire, so as to regard her children
as brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Hannah Smith married one Thomas Barton
of Brigstock, and her daughter Catherine (whose name mysteriously is
found as suing for the price of property sold to Charles II. for the
site of the King&rsquo;s house at Winchester), lived with Sir Isaac
Newton, was very beautiful, and much admired by Lord Halifax for her
wit and gaiety.&nbsp; It was even reported that she was privately married
to him, but this of course was mere scandal, and she became the wife
of Jonathan Conduitt, educated at Trinity College, a friend and pupil
of Newton, who had for many years assisted in the harder work of Master
of the Mint, and wrote an essay on the gold and silver coinage of the
realm.&nbsp; He was member of Parliament for Southampton.&nbsp; Sir
Isaac made his home with his niece and her husband till his death in
1727, when Mr. Conduitt succeeded to his office as Master of the Mint,
and intended to write his life, but was prevented by death in 1737.&nbsp;
Among the materials which Mr. Conduitt had preserved is the record of
Newton&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;I do not know what I may appear to the
world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on
the sea shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth
lay all undiscovered before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very curious relic of Sir Isaac survives in the garden at Cranbury
Park, viz. a sun-dial, said to have been calculated by Newton.&nbsp;
It is in bronze, in excellent preservation, and the gnomon so perforated
as to form the cypher I. C. seen either way.&nbsp; The dial is divided
into nine circles, the outermost divided into minutes, next, the hours,
then a circle marked &ldquo;Watch slow, Watch fast,&rdquo; another with
the names of places shown when the hour coincides with our noonday,
such as Samarcand and Aleppo, etc., all round the world.&nbsp; Nearer
the centre are degrees, then the months divided into days.&nbsp; There
is a circle marked with the points and divisions of the compass, and
within, a diagram of the compass, the points alternately plain and embossed.</p>
<p>There is no date, but the maker&rsquo;s name, John Rowley, and the
arms of Mr. Conduitt, as granted in 1717.&nbsp; Quarterly 1st and 4th
Gules, on a fesse wavy argent, between three pitchers double eared or,
as many bees volant proper.</p>
<p>2nd and 3rd Gules, a lion rampant argent between six acorns or.&nbsp;
Impaling argent 3 boars&rsquo; heads sable for Barton.</p>
<p>Crest - Two Caducean rods with wings, lying fesse ways or.&nbsp;
Thereon a peacock&rsquo;s head, erased proper.</p>
<p>The motto - &ldquo;Cada uno es hijo de sus obras.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Each
one is son of his deeds&rdquo; - translates the Spanish.</p>
<p>The 1st and 3rd quartering belongs to the old family of Chenduite,
from which Jonathan Conduitt may have been descended.&nbsp; Probably
he could not prove his right to their Arms, and therefore had the fresh
grant.</p>
<p>Mr. Conduitt died in 1737, leaving a daughter, whose guardians sold
Cranbury to Thomas Lee Dummer, Esquire, from whom it descended in 1765
to his son of the same name.</p>
<p>Catherine Conduitt married the son of Viscount Lymington, afterwards
created Earl of Portsmouth.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VII - THE BUILDING AT HURSLEY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the year 1718, Hursley was sold by Cromwell&rsquo;s two surviving
daughters for &pound;36,000 to William Heathcote, Esq., afterwards created
a baronet.</p>
<p>The Heathcotes belonged to a family of gentle blood in Derbyshire.&nbsp;
Gilbert Heathcote, one of the sons, was an Alderman at Chesterfield,
and was the common ancestor of the Rutland as well as the Hursley family.&nbsp;
His third son, Samuel, spent some years as a merchant at Dantzic, where
he made a considerable fortune, and returning to England, married Mary
the daughter of William Dawsonne of Hackney.&nbsp; He was an intimate
friend of the great Locke, and assisted him in his work on preserving
the standard of the gold coin of the realm.&nbsp; He died in 1708, his
son William and brother Gilbert attained to wealth and civic honours.</p>
<p>Sir Gilbert was Lord Mayor in 1711 and was the last who rode in procession
on the 9th of November.&nbsp; Both were Whigs, though the Jacobite Lord
Mayor, whose support was reckoned on by the Stuarts, was their cousin.</p>
<p>At about twenty-seven years of age, William Heathcote married Elizabeth,
only daughter of Thomas Parker, Earl of Macclesfield, and had in course
of time six sons and three daughters.&nbsp; He was M.P. first for Buckingham
and afterwards for Southampton.&nbsp; He was created a baronet in 1733.</p>
<p>There were plans drawn for enlarging the old lodge in which the Hobbys
and Cromwells had lived, but these seem to have been found impracticable,
and it was decided to pull the house down and erect a new one on a different
site.&nbsp; Tradition, and Noble in his <i>Cromwell</i>, declared that
the change was from dislike of the Cromwell opinions and usurpations,
but Mr. Marsh considers this &ldquo;mean and illiberal&rdquo; and combats
it sharply.</p>
<p>The new and much more spacious building was placed a little higher
up on the hill, with a wide bowling-green on the south side, where in
dry summers the old foundations of the former house can be traced, the
walnut avenues leading up to it.&nbsp; The house was in the style that
is now called Queen Anne, of red brick quoined with stone, with large-framed
heavy sash windows and double doors to each of the principal rooms,
some of which were tapestried with Gobelin arras representing the four
elements - Juno, with all the elements of the air; Ceres presiding over
the harvest, for the earth; Vulcan with the emblems of fire; and Amphitrite
drawn by Tritons personifying water.</p>
<p>There was then a great central entrance-hall, in the middle of the
northern side of the house, with stone steps going up at each end, outside,
but, as we see from drawings and prints of the time, with no carriage-approach
to the house, so that people must have driven up to the front door over
the grass.</p>
<p>Sir William died in 1751, fifty-eight years old.&nbsp; His son, Sir
Thomas, born in 1721, was the builder of old Hursley Church, which was
begun in 1752, and completed the next year, only the tower being left
of the former edifice.&nbsp; In 1808 some few capitals of the old pillars
remained in parts of the village, and were adjudged by Mr. Marsh to
be Saxon.&nbsp; It was said that the inside was very dark, the ground
outside being nearly on a level with the windows, and six or eight steps
descending to the floor.</p>
<p>It was all swept away, and the new structure was pronounced by Mr.
Marsh to be exceedingly &ldquo;neat, light, and airy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was 82 feet long, and 49 broad, with two aisles, and an arched ceiling,
supported on pillars.&nbsp; It might well be light, for the great round-headed
windows were an expanse of glass, very glaring in sunshine, though mitigated
by the waving lime-trees.&nbsp; The plan and dimensions followed those
of the old church, and were ample enough, the north aisle a good deal
shorter than the chancel, and all finished with gables crow-stepped
in the Dutch fashion.&nbsp; It was substantially paved within, and was
a costly and anxiously planned achievement in the taste of the time,
carefully preserving all the older monuments.&nbsp; A mausoleum in the
same style was built for the Heathcote family in the south-western corner
of the churchyard, and gradually the white-washed walls of the church
became ornamented (?) with the hatchments of each successive baronet
and his wife, the gentlemen&rsquo;s shields with the winged globe as
crest, and the motto <i>Deus prosperat justos</i>; the ladies&rsquo;
lozenge finished with a death&rsquo;s head above, and <i>Resurgam</i>
below.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was twice married and had eight children.&nbsp; He died
at sixty-five years of age on 29th of June 1787.&nbsp; He was succeeded
by his eldest son, the second Sir William, who was born in 1746, and
was member for the county in three Parliaments.&nbsp; He was a man of
great integrity, humanity, and charity, very affable and amiable, and
unassuming in his manners, &ldquo;and he died as he had lived, fearing
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He married Frances, daughter and co-heiress of John
Thorpe of Embley, and had seven children.</p>
<p>His eldest son, Sir Thomas, married the heiress of Thomas Edwards
Freeman, of Batsford, Gloucestershire, in 1799, and was known as Sir
Thomas Freeman Heathcote.&nbsp; He was member for the county from 1808
till 1820, when he retired.&nbsp; He is reported to have known an old
man who said he had held a gate open for Oliver Cromwell, but this must
have meant the grandson, who died in 1705.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas died without issue in his fifty-sixth year on the 21st
day of February 1825.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII - OLD OTTERBOURNE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Thomas Dummer, Esquire, who in 1765 succeeded his father in the possession
of Cranbury, was a man to whom some evil genius whispered, &ldquo;Have
a taste,&rdquo; for in 1770 he actually purchased the City Cross of
Winchester to set it up at Cranbury, but happily the inhabitants of
the city were more conservative than their corporation, and made such
a demonstration that the bargain was annulled, and the Cross left in
its proper place.&nbsp; He consoled himself with erecting a tall lath
and plaster obelisk in its stead, which was regarded with admiration
by the children of the parish for about sixty years, when weather destroyed
it.</p>
<p>He also transported several fragments from Netley Abbey, which formed
part of his property at Weston near Southampton, and set them up in
his park as an object from the windows.&nbsp; There is an arch, the
base of a pillar, and a bit of gateway tower, but no one has been able
to discover the part whence they came, so that not much damage can have
been done.&nbsp; The rear of the gateway has been made into a keeper&rsquo;s
lodge, and is known to the village of Otterbourne as &ldquo;the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is also said to have had a kind of menagerie, and to have been
once in danger from either a bear or a leopard; the man at Hursley who
rescued him did not seem in his old age to be clear which it was, though
he considered himself to have a claim on the property.</p>
<p>It would not have been easy to substantiate it, for Mr. Dummer died
without heirs about 1790, leaving his property at Cranbury and Netley
first to his widow, and after her to the Chamberlayne family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dummer lived many years after her husband, and married an artist,
then of some note, Sir Nathanael Dance, who assumed the name of Holland,
and in 1800 was created a baronet.&nbsp; He threw up painting as a profession,
but brought several good pictures to Cranbury.&nbsp; His wife survived
him till 1823-24, when William Chamberlayne, M.P. for Southampton, came
into the property, and from him, in 1829, it descended to his nephew,
Thomas Chamberlayne, Esquire.</p>
<p>Brambridge had a more eventful history.&nbsp; From the Welleses,
it passed to the Smythes, also Roman Catholics.&nbsp; Walter Smythe,
the first of these, was second son of Sir John Smythe of Acton Burnell
in Derbyshire.&nbsp; His daughter Mary Anne was married at nineteen
to one of the Welds of Lulworth Castle, who died within a year, and
afterwards to Thomas Fitzherbert, who left her a childless widow before
she was twenty-five.</p>
<p>It was six years later that, after vehement passionate entreaties
on the part of George, Prince of Wales, and even a demonstration of
suicide, she was wrought upon to consent to a private marriage with
him, which took place on the 21st of December 1785, at her house in
Park Lane, the ceremony being performed by a clergyman of the Church
of England, in the presence of her uncle and one of her brothers.</p>
<p>So testifies Jesse in his <i>Life of George III</i>.&nbsp; Nevertheless
there is at Twyford a belief that the wedding took place at midnight
in the bare little Roman Catholic Chapel at Highbridge, and likewise
in Brambridge House, where the vicar officiated and was sworn to secrecy.&nbsp;
The register, it is said, was deposited at Coutts&rsquo;s Bank under
a lock with four keys.&nbsp; The connection with Twyford was kept up
while the lady lived, but no one remains who can affirm the facts.&nbsp;
Her first marriage, in early youth, was most probably, as described,
at Brambridge.&nbsp; Her very small wedding ring is also extant, but
neither ring nor ceremony can belong to her royal marriage.&nbsp; It
would be curious that the adjoining parish of Marwell likewise had to
boast (if that is a right word) of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s marriage with
Jane Seymour.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fitzherbert certainly visited Brambridge, for an old gardener
named Newton, and Miss Frances Mary Bargus, who came to live at Otterbourne
in 1820, remembered her, and the latter noted her fine arched brows.&nbsp;
George IV.&rsquo;s love for her was a very poor thing, but she was the
only woman he ever had any real affection for, and he desired that her
miniature should be buried with him.</p>
<p>She survived him for many years, and died in 1837 at eighty-one years
old.</p>
<p>Her brother Walter was one of the English who visited Paris and was
made prisoner by Napoleon I. at the rupture of the peace of Amiens,
and detained till 1814.&nbsp; While he was a prisoner, his brother Charles
caused all the limes in the avenue at Brambridge to be pollarded, and
sold the tops for gun stocks.&nbsp; Nevertheless the trees are still
magnificent, making three aisles, all the branches inwards rising up
perpendicularly, those without sweeping gracefully down, and all budding
and fading simultaneously.&nbsp; The pity is that the modern house should
not have been built at one end or the other, so that they form actually
a passage that leads to nothing.&nbsp; Since his death, the property
has been sold, and has passed into strangers&rsquo; hands.&nbsp; The
endowment of the chapel has been transferred to one at Eastleigh, and
the house to which it was attached belongs to a market garden.</p>
<p>The two parishes were near enough to the coast to be kept in anxiety
by the French schemes for landing.&nbsp; The tenant of the Winchester
College property at Otterbourne is said to have kept all her goods packed
up, and to have stirred the fire with a stick all through one winter;
and as late as between 1840-50, Mr. Bailey of Hursley still had in his
barn the seats that had been prepared to fit into the waggons that were
to carry the women into the downs in the event of a battle.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Marsh, who in 1808 collected the memoranda of Hursley
and dedicated them to Sir William Heathcote, was curate of Hursley and
incumbent of Baddesley.&nbsp; The Vicar was the Rev. Gilbert Heathcote,
fifth son of Sir Thomas, second Baronet.&nbsp; He was afterwards Archdeacon
of Winchester and a Canon of Winchester.&nbsp; He was a man of great
musical talent, and some of his chants are still in use.&nbsp; The only
other fact recollected of him was, that being told that he used hard
words in his sermons, he asked a labourer if he knew what was meant
by Predestination, and was answered, &ldquo;Yes, sir, some&rsquo;at
about the innards of a pig.&rdquo;&nbsp; He generally resided there.&nbsp;
Mr. Marsh remained curate of Hursley and was presented to the living
of Baddesley.&nbsp; All this time Otterbourne had only one Sunday service,
alternately matins or evensong, and the church bell was rung as soon
as the clergyman could be espied riding down the lane.&nbsp; Old customs
so far survived that the congregation turned to the east in the Creed,
always stood up, if not sooner, when &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; occurred
at the end of the very peculiar anthems, and had never dropped the response,
&ldquo;Thanks be to Thee, O Lord,&rdquo; at the end of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Holy Communion was celebrated four times a year, 35. 7d. being
paid each time for the Elements, as is recorded in beautiful writing
in &ldquo;the Church Raiting book,&rdquo; which began to be kept in
1776.&nbsp; &ldquo;Washan the surples&rdquo; before Easter cost 4s.;
a Communion cloth, tenpence; and for washing and marking it, sixpence.&nbsp;
A new bell cost &pound; 5: <i>5</i>: 10, and its &ldquo;carridge&rdquo;
from London 11s. 10d.&nbsp; Whitewashing the church came to &pound;1:
1s., and work in the gallery to 10s. 4d.&nbsp; Besides, there was a
continual payment for dozens of <i>sprow</i> heads, also for fox heads
at threepence apiece, for a badger&rsquo;s head, a &ldquo;poul cat,&rdquo;
marten cats, and hedgehogs.&nbsp; These last, together with sparrows,
continue to appear till 1832, when the Rev. Robert Shuckburgh, in the
vestry, protested against such use of the church rate, and it was discontinued.&nbsp;
Mr. Shuckburgh was the first resident curate at Otterbourne, being appointed
by the Archdeacon.&nbsp; He was the first to have two services on Sunday,
though still the ante-Communion service was read from the desk, and
he there pulled off his much iron-moulded surplice from over his gown
and ascended the pulpit stair.&nbsp; The clerk limped along the aisle
to the partitioned space in the gallery to take part in the singing.</p>
<p>But changes were beginning.&nbsp; The direct coaching road between
Winchester and Southampton had been made, and many houses had followed
it.&nbsp; The road that crosses Colden Common and leads to Portsmouth
was also made about the same time, and was long called Cobbett&rsquo;s
road, from that remarkable self-taught peasant reformer, William Cobbett,
who took part in planning the direction.</p>
<p>Cobbett was a friend of Mr. Harley, a retired tradesman who bought
the cottage that had belonged to a widow, named Science Dear, and enlarged
it.&nbsp; Several American trees were planted in the ground by Cobbett,
of which only one survives, a hickory, together with some straggling
bushes of robinia, which Cobbett thought would make good hedges, being
very thorny, and throwing up suckers freely, but the branches proved
too brittle to be useful.&nbsp; About 1819 Mr. Harley sold his house
and the paddock adjoining to Mary Bargus, widow of the Rev. Thomas Bargus,
Vicar of Barkway in Hertfordshire, and she came to live there with her
daughter Frances Mary.&nbsp; In 1622, Miss Bargus married William Crawley
Yonge, youngest son of the Rev. Duke Yonge, Vicar of Cornwood, Devon,
of the old family of Yonges of Puslinch.&nbsp; He then retired from
the 52nd regiment, in which he had taken part in the Pyrenean battles,
and in those of Orthez and Toulouse, and had his share in the decisive
charge which completed the victory of Waterloo.&nbsp; They had two children,
Charlotte Mary, born August 11th, 1823, and Julian Bargus, born January
31st, 1830.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IX - CHURCH BUILDING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A new era began in both Hursley and Otterbourne with the accession
of Sir William Heathcote, the fifth baronet, and with the marriage of
William Yonge.</p>
<p>Sir William was born on the 17th of May 1801, the son of the Rev.
William Heathcote, Rector of Worting, Hants, and Prebendary of the Cathedral
of Winchester, second son of Sir William, third baronet.&nbsp; His mother
was Elizabeth, daughter of Lovelace Bigg Wither of Manydown Park in
the same county.&nbsp; She was early left a widow, and she bred up her
only son with the most anxious care.&nbsp; She lived chiefly at Winchester,
and it may be interesting to note that her son remembered being at a
Twelfth-day party where Jane Austen drew the character of Mrs. Candour,
and assumed the part with great spirit.</p>
<p>He was sent first to the private school of considerable reputation
at Ramsbury in Wiltshire, kept by the Rev. Edward Meyrick, and, after
four years there, became a commoner at Winchester College, where it
is said that he and Dr. William Sewell were the only boys who jointly
retarded the breaking out of the rebellion against Dr. Gabell, which
took place after their departure.&nbsp; However, in April 1818 he left
Winchester, and became a commoner of Oriel College, Oxford, where his
tutor was the Rev. John Keble, only eight years older than himself,
and not yet known to fame, but with an influence that all who came in
contact with him could not fail to feel.</p>
<p>In 1821 Mr. Heathcote gained a First-class in his B.A. examination,
and was elected Fellow of All Souls in November 1822.&nbsp; He began
to read at the Temple, but in April 1825 he came into the property of
his uncle, and in the November of the same year he married the Hon.
Caroline Frances Perceval, the youngest daughter of Charles George Lord
Arden.&nbsp; Both he and his wife were deeply religious persons, with
a strong sense of the duties of their station.&nbsp; Education and influence
had done their best work on a character of great rectitude and uprightness,
even tending to severity, such as softened with advancing years.&nbsp;
Remarkably handsome, and with a high-bred tone of manners, he was almost
an ideal country gentleman, with, however, something of stiffness and
shyness in early youth, which wore off in later years.&nbsp; In 1826
he became member for the county on the Tory interest.</p>
<p>As a landlord, he is remembered as excellent.&nbsp; His mother took
up her abode at Southend House in Hursley parish, and under the auspices
of the Heathcote family, and of the Misses Marsh, daughters of the former
curate, Sunday and weekday schools were set on foot, the latter under
Mrs. Ranger and her daughter, whose rule continued almost to the days
of national education.&nbsp; One of his first proceedings was to offer
the living of Hursley to the Rev. John Keble, who had spent a short
time there as curate in 1826.&nbsp; It was actually accepted, when the
death of a sister made his presence necessary to his aged father at
Fairford in Gloucestershire; and for two years, during which the publication
of the <i>Christian Year</i> took place, he remained in charge of a
small parish adjacent to his home.</p>
<p>About 1824 Mrs. Yonge began to keep the first Sunday school at Otterbourne
in a hired room, teaching the children, all girls, chiefly herself,
and reading part of the Church Service to them at the times when it
was not held at church.&nbsp; The only week-day school was on the hill,
kept by a picturesque old dame, whose powers amounted to hindering the
children from getting into mischief, but who - with the instinct Mrs.
Charles describes - never forgave the advances that disturbed her monopoly.</p>
<p>In 1826, as Mrs. Yonge was looking at the empty space of a roadway
that had led into the paddock before it became a lawn, she said, &ldquo;How
I should like to build a school here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her mother, Mrs. Bargus, &ldquo;you shall
have what I can give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Yonge contrived the room built of cement, with two tiny ones
behind for kitchen and bedroom for the mistress, and a brick floor;
and the first mistress, Mrs. Creswick, was a former servant of Archdeacon
Heathcote&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She was a gentle woman, with dark eyes and a lame leg, so that she
could not walk to church with the children, who sat on low benches along
the nave, under no discipline but the long stick Master Oxford, the
clerk, brandished over them.&nbsp; Nor could she keep the boys in any
order, and the big ones actually kicked a hole nearly through the cement
wall behind them.&nbsp; At last, under the sanction of the Rev. Gilbert
Wall Heathcote, who had succeeded his father as Vicar of Hursley, a
rough cast room was erected in the churchyard, where Master Oxford kept
school, with more upright goodness than learning; and Mr. Shuckburgh,
the curate, and Mr. Yonge had a Sunday school there.</p>
<p>The riots at the time of the Reform Bill did not greatly affect the
two parishes, though a few villagers joined the bands who went about
asking for money at the larger houses.&nbsp; George, Sir William&rsquo;s
second son, told me that he remembered being locked into the strong
room on some alarm, but whether it came actually to the point of an
attack is a question.&nbsp; It was also said that one man at Otterbourne
hid himself in a bog, that the rioters might not call upon him; and
one other man, James Collins, went about his work as usual, and heard
nothing of any rising.</p>
<p>One consequence of the riotous state of the country was the raising
of troops of volunteer yeomanry cavalry.&nbsp; Charles Shaw Lefevre,
Esq. (afterwards Speaker and Lord Eversley), was colonel, Sir William
was major and captain of such a troop, Mr. Yonge a captain; but at one
of the drills in Hursley Park a serious accident befell Sir William.&nbsp;
His horse threw back its head, and gave him a violent blow on the forehead,
which produced concussion of the brain.&nbsp; He was long in recovering,
and a slight deafness in one ear always remained.</p>
<p>In 1835 a far greater trouble fell on him in the death of the gentle
Lady Heathcote, leaving him three sons and a daughter.&nbsp; In the
midst of his grief, he was able to bring his old friend and tutor nearer
to him.&nbsp; Mr. Keble at the funeral gave him the poem, as yet unpublished,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I thought to meet no more,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>which had been written after the funeral of his own sister, Mary
Anne Keble.&nbsp; The elder Mr. Keble died in the course of the same
year, and Mr. Gilbert Wall Heathcote, resigning the living to become
a fellow of Winchester, it was again given to the Rev. John Keble.&nbsp;
Mr. Heathcote had brought to Otterbourne a young Fellow of New College,
a deacon just twenty-three, the Reverend William Bigg Wither, who came
for six weeks and remained thirty-five years.&nbsp; He found only twelve
Communicants in the parish, and left seventy!</p>
<p>Mr. Keble was already known and revered as the author of the <i>Christian
Year</i>, and was Professor of Poetry at Oxford, when he came to Hursley;
having married, on the 10th of October 1835, Charlotte Clarke, the most
perfect of helpmeets to pastor or to poet, save only in the frailness
of her health.</p>
<p>He had two years previously preached at Oxford the assize sermon
on National Apostasy, which Newman marks as the beginning of the awakening
of the country to church doctrine and practice.&nbsp; He and his brother
were known as contributors to the <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, which
were rousing the clergy in the same direction, but which were so much
misunderstood, and excited so much obloquy, that Mr. Norris of Hackney,
himself a staunch old-fashioned churchman, who had held up the light
in evil times, said to his young friend, the Rev. Robert Francis Wilson,
a first-class Oriel man, to whom the curacy of Hursley had been offered,
&ldquo;Now remember if you become Keble&rsquo;s curate, you will lose
all chance of preferment for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, though a man of much talent, was willing to accept the
probability, which proved a correct augury.</p>
<p>The new state of things was soon felt.&nbsp; Daily Services and monthly
Eucharists, began; and the school teaching and cottage visiting were
full of new life.&nbsp; Otterbourne had, even before Mr. Keble&rsquo;s
coming, begun to feel the need of a new church.&nbsp; The population
was 700, greatly overflowing the old church, so that the children really
had to be excluded when the men were there.&nbsp; It was also at an
inconvenient distance from the main body of the inhabitants, who chiefly
lived along the high road.&nbsp; Moreover, the South Western Railway
was being made, and passed so near, that to those whose ears were unaccustomed
to the sound of trains, it seemed as if the noise would be a serious
interruption to the service.</p>
<p>Mr. Yonge had begun to take measures for improving and enlarging
the old church, but was recommended to wait for the appointment of the
new incumbent.&nbsp; Mr. Keble threw himself heartily into the scheme,
and it was decided that it would be far better to change the site of
the church at once.&nbsp; The venerable Dr. Routh, who was then President
of St. Mary Magdalen College, and used yearly to come on progress to
the old manor house, the Moat House, to hold his court, took great interest
in the project, and the college gave an excellent site on the western
slope of the hill, with the common crossed by the high road in front,
and backed by the woods of Cranbury Park.&nbsp; Also a subscription
of large amount was given.&nbsp; Sir William Heathcote as patron, as
well as Mr. Keble, contributed largely, and Mr. Bigg Wither gave up
his horse, and presented &pound;25 out of each payment he received as
Fellow of New College.&nbsp; Other friends also gave, and, first and
last, about &pound;3000 was raised.</p>
<p>Church building was much more difficult in those days than in these.&nbsp;
Ecclesiastical architecture had scarcely begun to revive, and experts
were few, if any indeed deserved the title.&nbsp; An architect at Winchester,
Mr. Owen Carter, was employed, but almost all the ideas, and many of
the drawings of the details came from Mr. Yonge, who started with merely
the power of military drawing (acquired before he was sixteen years
old) and a great admiration for York Cathedral.</p>
<p>The cruciform plan was at once decided on (traced out at first with
a stick on Cranbury grand drive), but the slope of the ground hindered
it from being built duly east and west; the material is brick, so burnt
as to be glazed grey on one side.&nbsp; Hearing of a church (Corstan,
Wiltshire) with a bell-turret likely to suit the means and the two bells,
Mr. Yonge and Mr. Wither rode to see it, and it was imitated in the
design.&nbsp; The chancel was, as in most of the new churches built
at this time, only deep enough for the sanctuary, as surpliced choirs
had not been thought possible in villages, and so many old chancels
had been invaded by the laity that it was an object to keep them out.</p>
<p>Mr. Yonge sought diligently for old patterns and for ancient carving
in oak, and in Wardour Street he succeeded in obtaining five panels,
representing the Blessed Virgin and the four Latin Fathers, which are
worked into the pulpit; also an exceedingly handsome piece of carving,
which was then adapted as altar-rail - evidently Flemish - with scrolls
containing corn and grapes, presided over by angels, and with two groups
of kneeling figures; on one side, apparently an Emperor with his crown
laid down, and the collar of the Golden Fleece around his neck, followed
by a group of male figures, one with a beautiful face.&nbsp; On the
other side kneels a lady, not an empress, with a following of others
bringing flowers.&nbsp; At the divisions stand Religious of the four
Orders, one a man.&nbsp; The idea is that it probably represents either
the coronation of Maximilian or the abdication of Charles V.&nbsp; In
either case there was no wife, but the crown is not imperial, and that
is in favour of Maximilian.&nbsp; On the other hand the four monastic
Orders are in favour of Charles V.&rsquo;s embracing the religious life.</p>
<p>For the stone-work, Mr. Yonge discovered that the material chiefly
used in the cathedral was Caen stone, though the importation had long
ceased.&nbsp; He entered into communication with the quarrymen there,
sent out a stone mason (Newman) from Winchester, and procured stone
for the windows, reredos, and font, thus opening a traffic that has
gone on ever since.</p>
<p>Mistakes were made from ignorance and lack of authoritative precedent,
before ecclesiology had become a study; but whatever could be done by
toil, intelligence, and self-devotion was done by Mr. Yonge in those
two years; and the sixty years that have since elapsed have seen many
rectifications of the various errors.&nbsp; Even as the church stood
when completed, it was regarded as an effort in the right direction,
and a good example to church builders.&nbsp; The first stone was laid
in Whitsun-week 1837 by Julian Bargus, Mr. Yonge&rsquo;s five-year-old
son.&nbsp; A school for the boys was built on a corner of the ground
intended as churchyard, and a larger room added to the girls&rsquo;,
the expense being partly defrayed by a bazaar held at Winchester, and
in part by Charlotte Yonge&rsquo;s first book, <i>The Ch&acirc;teau
de Melville</i>, which people were good enough to buy, though it only
consisted of French exercises and translations.&nbsp; The consecration
took place on the 30th of July 1838, and immediately after daily matins
were commenced.&nbsp; So that the Church of St. Matthew has never in
sixty years been devoid of the voice of praise, except during casual
absences.&nbsp; Most of the trees in the churchyard were planted by
Mr. Bigg Wither, especially the great Sequoia, and the holly hedge around
was grown by him from the berries of the first Christmas decoration,
which he sowed in a row under the wall of the boys&rsquo; school, and
transplanted when large enough.</p>
<p>It was in 1839 that Mr. Keble published his Oxford Psalter, a work
he had been engaged on for years, paying strict and reverent attention
to the Hebrew original, and not thinking it right to interweave expressions
of his own as guidance to meaning.&nbsp; His belief was that Holy Scripture
is so many-sided, and so fathomless in signification, that to dwell
on one point more than another might be a wrong to the full impression,
and an irreverence in the translation.&nbsp; Thus, as a poet, he sacrificed
a good deal to the duty of being literal, but his translation is a real
assistance to students, and it is on the whole often somewhat like to
Sternhold&rsquo;s, whom he held in much respect for his adherence to
the originals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be mentioned here that the parishes of Hursley and
Otterbourne were in such good order under the management of Sir William
Heathcote and Mr. Yonge, that under the new Poor Law they were permitted
to form a small Union of four, afterwards five, and now six parishes.</p>
<p>Ampfield was a hamlet lying on the western side of Hursley Park and
wood, a very beautiful wood in parts, of oak and beech trees, which
formed lovely vaulted arcades, one of which Mr. Keble used to call Hursley
Cathedral.&nbsp; The place was increasing in population, and nearly
two miles of woodland and park lay between it and the parish church.</p>
<p>Sir William Heathcote, therefore, resolved to build a church for
the people, and Mr. Yonge was again the architect and clerk of the works,
profiting by the experience gained at Otterbourne, so as to aim at Early
English rather than Decorated style.&nbsp; A bell turret, discovered
later at Leigh Delamere in Wiltshire, was a more graceful model than
that of Corston.&nbsp; The situation was very beautiful, cut out, as
it were, of the pine plantation on a rising ground above the road to
Romsey, so that when the first stone was laid by Gilbert Vyvyan, Sir
William&rsquo;s third son, the Psalm, &ldquo;Lo, we heard of the same
at Ephrata, and found it in the wood,&rdquo; sounded most applicable.&nbsp;
St. Mark was the saint of the dedication, which fell opportunely on
21st April 1841, very near Mr. Keble&rsquo;s birthday, St. Mark&rsquo;s
day, and to many it was a specially memorable day, as the Rev. J. H.
Newman was present with his sister, Mrs. Thomas Mozley, and her husband,
then vicar of Cholderton; and the Rev. Isaac Williams, a sacred poet,
whose writings ought to be better known than they are, was also present.&nbsp;
The endowment was provided by the chapter of Winchester giving up the
great tithes, and a subscription of which T. White, Esq. of Ampfield
gave &pound;500.</p>
<p>The Rev. Robert Francis Wilson was the first curate, being succeeded
in the curacy of Hursley by the Rev. Peter Young, then a deacon, who
inhabited the old vicarage.&nbsp; The present one, which had been built
by Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote, was made over to the living by Sir
William some years later.</p>
<p>Immediately after the consecration, Sir William was married to Selina,
daughter of Evelyn John Shirley, Esq., of Eatington, Warwickshire, a
marriage occasioning great happiness and benefit to all the parish and
neighbourhood.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER X - HURSLEY CHURCH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In one of his prose writings Mr. Keble speaks of the faithful shepherd
going on his way though storms may be raging in the atmosphere; and
such might be a description of his own course as regarded his flock,
though there were several of these storms that affected him deeply.&nbsp;
One gust came very near home.</p>
<p>The diocesan, Bishop Charles Sumner, was an excellent and conscientious
man, with a much deeper sense of his duties as a bishop than his immediate
predecessors, and of great kindness and beneficence; but he had been
much alarmed and disturbed by the alleged tendencies of the <i>Tracts
for the Times</i>, and shared in the desire of most of the authorities
to discourage their doctrines and practice.&nbsp; When, therefore, the
curate of Hursley came to Farnham to be admitted to the priesthood,
he was required, contrary to the usual custom with candidates, to state
categorically his views upon the Holy Eucharist.&nbsp; He used the expressions
of the Catechism, also those of Bishop Ridley, but was desired to use
his own individual words; and when these were sent in, he was rejected,
though they did not outrun the doctrine that had always been taught
by the close followers of the doctrine of the Catechism.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
in spite of this disapproval, there was no withdrawal of his licence,
and he remained at Hursley, not thinking it loyal to seek Ordination
from another bishop, as would readily have been granted.&nbsp; He married
Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s cousin, Miss Caroline Coxwell, and their young family
was an infinite source of delight to the childless vicarage.</p>
<p>Their baby ways, to one who held that &ldquo;where christened infants
sport, the floor is holy,&rdquo; and who read a mystical meaning into
many of their gestures and words, were a constant joy and inspiration;
and there grew up a store of poems upon them and other little ones,
especially the children of Dr. George Moberly, then headmaster of Winchester
College (later bishop of Salisbury).&nbsp; These Mr. Keble thought of
putting together for publication, being chiefly impelled to do so by
the desire to improve Hursley Church, the eighteenth century arrangement
of which really prevented the general inculcation of the more reverent
observances which teach and imply doctrine.</p>
<p>In consideration of the feelings of certain old parishioners, and
the other more pressing needs, as well as of the patience with which
so great an enterprise needed in his mind to be contemplated, nine years
had elapsed since his incumbency had begun before he wrote: &ldquo;We
are stirring about our Church, and next spring I hope really to go to
work; you must come and see the plans first, or else hereafter for ever
hold your peace in respect of alleging impediments.&nbsp; One feels
that one&rsquo;s advanced age has not rendered one fitted to set about
such works; but really the irreverence and other mischiefs caused by
the present state of Hursley Church seem to leave one no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The step that had first been taken was one for which many generations
far and wide have reason to be grateful, the arrangement and publication
of the <i>Lyra Innocentium</i>, to a certain degree on the lines of
the <i>Christian Year</i>, so as to have one poem appropriated to each
Sunday and holy day (though these were only fully marked off in a later
edition).</p>
<p>The book is perhaps less universally read than the <i>Christian Year</i>,
and is more unequal, some poems rising higher and into greater beauty,
some deeper and showing that the soul had made further progress in these
twenty years, some very simple in structure, fit for little children,
yet with a grave and solemn thought in the last verse.</p>
<p>Those that are specially full of Hursley atmosphere, on events connected
with the author, may be touched on here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Eve Vespers&rdquo; was suggested by the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
little daughter going into church before the decoration had been put
up, and exclaiming, disappointed, &ldquo;No Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Second Sunday in Lent&rdquo; recalls, in the line on &ldquo;the
mimic rain on poplar leaves,&rdquo; the sounds made by a trembling aspen,
whose leaves quivered all through the summer evenings, growing close
to the house of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s life-long friend and biographer, Sir
John Taylor Coleridge, at Ottery St. Mary.&nbsp; An engraving of Raffaelle&rsquo;s
last picture &ldquo;The Transfiguration&rdquo; hung in the Vicarage
drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fourth Sunday in Lent,&rdquo; on the offering of the lad
with the five loaves, was suggested by the stained window on that subject
given by the young Marquess of Lothian - a pupil for some years of Mr.
Wilson at Ampfield - to the church at Jedburgh, built by his mother.&nbsp;
Now that he has passed away, it may be remarked that he, as well as
all the children commemorated in these poems, grew up so as to leave
no painful impression connected with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep thou, dear
boy, thine early vow,&rdquo; was fulfilled in him, as it was with George
Herbert Moberly, the eldest son of Dr. Moberly, who, when a young child
staying at the vicarage, was unconsciously the cause of the poems &ldquo;Loneliness&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Repeating the Creed,&rdquo; for Easter Sunday and Low Sunday.&nbsp;
Frightened by unwonted solitude at bedtime, he asked to hear &ldquo;something
true,&rdquo; and was happy when Mrs. Keble produced the Bible.&nbsp;
He was a boy of beautiful countenance, and his reverent, thoughtful
look, as he repeated the Creed, delighted Mr. Keble.&nbsp; It was little
expected then that he was doomed to a life-long struggle with invalidism,
though he was able to effect much as a thinker and a priest before he,
too, was taken to see in Paradise &ldquo;the glorious dream around him
burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a baby sister of his who drew herself up in her nurse&rsquo;s
arms with a pretty gesture, like a pheasant&rsquo;s neck in a sort of
reproof, as she said &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to her little self, when
she had held out a flower to Mr. Keble, which, for once in his life,
he did not notice; and his self-reproach produced the thoughts of thankfulness.&nbsp;
One of the gems of the <i>Lyra</i>, &ldquo;Bereavement,&rdquo; was the
thought that came to the mind of the Pastor as he buried the little
sister, the only child except the elder girl, of the bailiff at Dr.
Moberly&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; embodied his feeling
about a burnt child at Ampfield -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We miss thee from thy place at school<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
on thy homeward way,<br />Where violets, by the shady pool,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peep
out so shyly gay</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Lullaby, with the view of the burnished cross upon the spire,
and the girl singing the baby to sleep with the old Psalm -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In Thee I put my stedfast trust,<br />Defend me, Lord, for Thou art
just,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>is another Ampfield scene, inspiring noble and gentle thoughts for
Innocents&rsquo; Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lifting up to the Cross&rdquo; (St. James&rsquo;s Day) was
the product of a drawing brought home from Germany of a sight beheld
by Miss Maria Trench, on a journey with Sir William and Lady Heathcote.&nbsp;
She afterwards became Mrs. Robert F. Wilson, and made her first wedded
home at Ampfield; and there is another commemoration of that journey
in the fountain under the bank in Ampfield churchyard, an imitation
of one observed in Tyrol and with the motto -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cooling waters here you drink<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest
not your thoughts below,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look to the sacred sign
and think<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence living waters
flow,<br />Then fearlessly advance by night or day,<br />The holy Cross
stands guardian of your way.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;More Stars&rdquo; (All Saints&rsquo; Day) and &ldquo;Wakefulness&rdquo;
(The Annunciation) are reminiscences of Charles Coleridge Pode, a little
nephew of Mr. Yonge, and his ecstatic joy on the first night of being
out of doors late enough to see the glory of the stars.&nbsp; A few
months later, on a sister being born, he hoped that her name would be
Mary &ldquo;because he liked the Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when,
only a few days later, his own mother was taken from him, he lay awake
and silent, night after night.&nbsp; He, too, was one who fulfilled
his early promise, till, as a young physician, he was cut off after
much patient suffering.&nbsp; &ldquo;More Stars&rdquo; is also attributed
to an exclamation of one of Mr. Peter Young&rsquo;s children; but in
point of fact, most little ones have broken out in a similar joyous
shout on their first conscious sight of the starry heavens.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keble used to forbear telling of the subjects of these poems,
lest, as she said, there might be a sort of blight on the children in
breaking the reserve; but most of them are beyond the reach of that
danger in publicity; and I can only further mention that the village
children <i>en masse</i>, and the curate&rsquo;s in detail, furnished
many more of the subjects, while still they only regarded Mr. Keble
as their best of playmates.</p>
<p>They cheered him when the great sorrow of his life befell him in
the secession of John Henry Newman, hitherto his friend and fellow-worker.&nbsp;
It came at a time when perhaps he was most fitted to bear it, when his
brother in Gloucestershire and his wife at home had just begun to recover
from a terrible typhoid fever caught at Bude.</p>
<p>Words spoken in the immediate prospect of death, by Mrs. Keble, strengthened
her husband&rsquo;s faith and made him more than ever determined to
hold fast by the Church of his fathers; and the thankfulness and exhilaration
caused by the improvement in her health carried him the better over
the first blow, though he went out alone to a quiet deserted chalk-pit
to open the letter which he knew would bring the final news of the reception
of his friend into the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Nor did his Hursley plans stand still.&nbsp; Under the management
of Sir John Taylor Coleridge and other friends, the <i>Christian Year</i>
had become much more profitable, and the <i>Lyra</i> also brought in
a considerable quota, so that the entire work could be undertaken at
Mr. Keble&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>It was decided, partly by Mr. Yonge himself, that the enterprise
was on too large a scale for his partial knowledge, and moreover, much
progress had been made during these nine years in ecclesiology, so that
architects who had made it their study were to be found.&nbsp; The design
was committed to William Harrison, Esq., a relation of Archdeacon Harrison,
a very old friend and contemporary.&nbsp; It followed the lines of the
existing church, which were found to be so solid and well built as for
the most part only to need casing and not renewal, nor was the old tower
taken down.</p>
<p>The contract with Locke and Nesham was for &pound;3380, exclusive
of the flooring, the wood-work, and other fittings of the interior.&nbsp;
For this &pound;1200 was set aside, but the sum was much exceeded, and
there were many offerings from private friends.</p>
<p>The altar of cedar-wood was the gift of Robert Williams, Esq.; the
altar plate was given by Mrs. Heathcote; the rails by the architect;
the font by the Rev. William Butler and Emma his wife, and the clergy
and sisters of Wantage.&nbsp; Mr. Butler was then vicar of Wantage,
later canon of Worcester and dean of Lincoln.&nbsp; The present cedar
credence table was made long after Mr. Keble&rsquo;s death, the original
one was walnut, matching the chancel fittings.</p>
<p>This was proposed as the inscription on the base of the font, to
be entirely hidden - </p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>

<p>Whether the whole was actually cut out on the under side of the granite
step must be uncertain.</p>
<p>The steps of the sanctuary have in encaustic tiles these texts.&nbsp;
On the lowest:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have a right
to the Tree of Life, and enter through the gates into the city.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On the step on which the rails stand:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On the next:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.&nbsp; Blessed
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And on the highest:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty, they shall behold the
land that is very far off.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The lectern was the offering of the friend of his youth, the Rev.
Charles Dyson, Rector of Dogmersfield, copied from that at Corpus Christi
College, where they first met.</p>
<p>The corbels were carefully chosen: those by the chancel arch are
heads of St. Peter and St. Paul, as exponents of the inner mysteries;
those by the east window are St. Athanasius and St. Augustine as champions
of the faith.&nbsp; On the corbels of the north porch, looking towards
the hills of Winchester, are Bishops Andrewes and Ken on the outside;
on the inside, Wykeham and Waynflete.&nbsp; On the south porch, St.
Augustine of Canterbury, and the Empress Helena over the door; on the
outside, Bishop Sumner and Queen Victoria to mark the date of building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to have the book boards of the seats?&rdquo;
wrote the architect; &ldquo;perhaps it would suggest the idea of a prayer
desk if they were made to slope as the chancel stalls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And certainly their finials do suggest kneeling, and the arrangement
is such that it is nearly impossible not to assume a really devotional
attitude.</p>
<p>A stranger clergyman visited the church, measured the font and the
height to the ceiling, and in due time, in 1850, there arrived the beautiful
carved canopy, the donor never being known.</p>
<p>The windows did not receive their coloured glass at first; but Mr.
Keble had an earnest wish to make them follow the wonderful emblematic
series to which he had been accustomed in the really unique Church of
Fairford, where he had grown up.&nbsp; The glass of these windows had
been taken in a Flemish ship on the way to Spain by one John Tame, a
Gloucestershire merchant, who had proceeded to rebuild his parish church
so as fitly to receive it, and he must also have obtained the key to
their wonderful and suggestive arrangement.</p>
<p>Fairford Church is much larger than Hursley, so that the plan could
not be exactly followed, but it was always in Mr. Keble&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
It was proposed that the glass should be given by the contribution of
friends and lovers of the <i>Christian Year</i>.&nbsp; Two of the windows
came from the Offertory on the Consecration day, one three-light was
given by Mrs. Heathcote (mother of Sir William), another by Sir William
and Lady Heathcote, one by the Marchioness of Bath, and one by the Marchioness
of Lothian.&nbsp; The designs were more or less suggested by Dyce and
Copley Fielding, but the execution was carried out by Wailes, under
the supervision of Butterfield.&nbsp; The whole work was an immense
delight to Mr. Keble, and so anxious was he that the whole should be
in keeping, that the east window was actually put in three times before
it was judged satisfactory.&nbsp; The plan of the whole was Mr. Keble&rsquo;s
own; and though the colours are deeper, and what is now called more
crude, than suits the taste of the present day, they must be looked
upon with reverence as the outcome of his meditations and his great
delight.&nbsp; I transcribe the explanation that his sister Elisabeth
wrote of their arrangement:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Hursley windows are meant to be a course of Instruction in Sacred
History from Adam to the last day the church being dedicated to All
Saints.</p>
<p>The north-west window has Adam and Noah.&nbsp; The windows along
the north aisle each represent two persons from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The three-light window on the north side, David with the ground plan
of the Temple, Moses with the Tables of the Law, Solomon with the Model
of the Temple.&nbsp; The Medallion under Moses is the Altar of Incense,
and some of the Holy things.</p>
<p>The whole of that window means to represent the fixing and finishing
of the Old Religion.</p>
<p>Then comes in the north chancel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel,
the prophets preparing for the Gospel.</p>
<p>The north-east window has the Circumcision connecting the Law with
the Church, with the figures of Anna and Simeon on each side.</p>
<p>East window: The Crucifixion, The Blessed Virgin and St. John on
each side, The Agony, Bearing the Cross, and the Scourging.</p>
<p>The side window of the Sanctuary has St. Stephen and St. John the
Baptist as the nearest Martyrs to our Lord, both before and after Him,
and their martyrdoms underneath.</p>
<p>The south-east window: The Resurrection, with soldiers at the Sepulchre.&nbsp;
St. Peter and St. Paul on each side.</p>
<p>The south chancel windows: The Four Evangelists; under, St. Luke,
the Disciples at Emmaus; under, St. John, he and St. Peter at the Sepulchre.</p>
<p>The three-light south window: St. James the Less, first Bishop of
Jerusalem; underneath, the Council in Acts x. 6.&nbsp; At his side two
successors of the Apostles, St. Clement of Rome, Phil. iv. 3, and St.
Dionysius of Athens, Acts xvii. 34, to show how the Church is built
upon the Apostles.</p>
<p>In the west window, the Last Judgment, with St. Michael with his
scales, and answering to Adam and Noah in the west window of the north
aisle; and as a repentance window, St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalene
in the west of the south aisle.&nbsp; In the two windows close to the
font, St. Philip and Nicodemus, for baptism.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>So were carried out the lines in the <i>Lyra Innocentium.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saints are there the Living Dead,<br />The
mourners glad and strong;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacred floor their
quiet bed,<br />Their beams from every window shed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
voice in every song.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The clerestory windows were put in somewhat later, on finding that
the church was dark, and Mr. Keble wished to have the children mentioned
in Scripture, in outline upon them, but this was not carried out.</p>
<p>It was first thought probable that readers of the <i>Christian Year</i>
and the <i>Lyra Innocentium</i> might have presented these stained windows,
but the plan fell through, and the only others actually given were the
repentance window, representing St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalene, by
Mr. Harrison.&nbsp; Two were paid for by special offertories, and the
rest were finally given by Mr. Keble, as the sums came in from his published
writings.</p>
<p>The spire, completing the work, was added to the ancient tower by
Sir William Heathcote.</p>
<p>The foundation stone, a brass plate with an inscription surrounded
by oak leaves and acorns, was laid on the 29th of May 1847, but the
spot is unknown.&nbsp; The entire cost, exclusive of the woodwork and
the gifts mentioned, amounted to &pound;6000.&nbsp; The large barn was
used as a temporary church, and there are happy recollections connected
with it and with the elm-shaded path between the Park and the vicarage
field.&nbsp; When all sat on forms without the shade of pews, example
taught a lesson of reverent attitude to the congregation, who felt obliged
to lay aside any bad habits which might have grown up out of sight,
so as to be unconsciously prepared for the new church, where the very
width of the open benches and the shape of their ends are suggestive
of kneeling in prayer.&nbsp; The period of the building was a time of
enjoyment to Mr. Keble, for it was symbolical to him of the &ldquo;edifying,&rdquo;
building up, of the living stones of the True Church, and the restoring
her waste places.&nbsp; When the workmen were gone home he used to walk
about the open space in the twilight silence in prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>When the topmost stone was to be added, on 18th October 1848, and
the weathercock finally secured, Mr. Keble ascended to the elevation
that he might set his hand to the work, and there said a thanksgiving
for the completion - &ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation
of this house.&nbsp; His hands shall also finish it&rdquo; (Zech. iv.
9).</p>
<p>The day of the Consecration was an exceedingly happy one, on 24th
October 1848, the only drawback being that Sir William Heathcote was
too unwell to be present.&nbsp; There was a great gathering - the two
Judges, Coleridge and Patteson, and many other warm and affectionate
friends; and Sir John Coleridge was impressed by the &ldquo;sweet state
of humble thankfulness&rdquo; of the Vicar and his wife in the completion
of the work.</p>
<p>The sermon at Evensong on that day was preached by Mr. Keble himself,
in which he spoke of the end of all things; and said the best fate that
could befall that new church was that it should be burnt at the Judgment
Day.</p>
<p>He thought, probably, of the perils of perversion from true Catholic
principles which the course of affairs in these days made him dread
exceedingly, and hold himself ready to act like the Non-jurors, or the
Free Kirk men in Scotland, who had resigned all for the sake of principle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I suppose it is one&rsquo;s
duty to go on as if all were encouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did go on, and supported others till, by God&rsquo;s Providence,
the tide had turned, and much was effected of which he had only dreamt
as some day possible.&nbsp; It was in this frame of mind that the poem
was composed of which this is a fragment:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd lingers on the lone hillside,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
act to count his faithful flock again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere to
a stranger&rsquo;s eye and arm untried<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
yield the rod of his old pastoral reign.<br />He turns and round him
memories throng amain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts that had seem&rsquo;d
for ever left behind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;ertake him, e&rsquo;en
as by some greenwood lane<br />The summer flies the passing traveller
find,<br />Keen, but not half so sharp as now thrill o&rsquo;er his
mind.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>For indeed every lapse in his parish turned to fill their pastor
with self-blame.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XI - THE GOLDEN DAYS OF HURSLEY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Those forebodings of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s mercifully never were realised;
many more years were granted in which Hursley saw the Church and the
secular power working together in an almost ideal way.</p>
<p>To speak of what Sir William Heathcote was as a county gentleman
would be difficult.&nbsp; He was for many years Chairman of the Quarter
Sessions, and it is worth recording that when King Frederick William
IV. of Prussia wished for information on the practical working of the
English system of government, and sent over two jurists to enquire into
the working of the unpaid magistracy, they were advised to attend the
Winchester Quarter Sessions, as one of the best regulated to be found.&nbsp;
They were guests at Hursley Park, and, as a domestic matter, their interest
in English dishes, and likewise their surprise at the status of an English
clergyman, were long remembered.</p>
<p>Considerable county undertakings originated in these days - a new
and well-managed lunatic asylum at Fareham, a renewed jail on the then
approved principles, and the inauguration of county police.&nbsp; In
all these undertakings Sir William Heathcote and Mr. Yonge were active
movers, and gave constant superintendence while they were carried out.&nbsp;
Ill health obliged Sir William to retire from the representation of
North Hants in the Conservative interest in 1847, but in 1854, on the
recommendation of Sir Robert Harry Inglis, he was elected member for
the University of Oxford, and so remained till his final retirement
in 1868.&nbsp; What he was in both public and private capacities has
nowhere been better expressed than by the late Earl of Carnarvon in
a letter to the editor of the <i>Times.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Long time a county member, and intimately acquainted with the subjects
and interests which formed the heritage of English county gentlemen,
he was, as a chairman of Quarter Sessions, recognised and often appealed
to as the very representative and pattern of the class; and when afterwards
he accepted the blue riband of Parliamentary representation as member
for the University of Oxford, from first to last, through all the waves
and weathers of political and personal bitterness, he retained the trust
of friend and opponent.&nbsp; So long as he cared to keep that seat,
all men desired to keep him.&nbsp; For this was his special characteristic,
that in every period and pursuit of life, in the public business of
his county, in the House of Commons, in the University, he not only
enjoyed respect and affection, but he conciliated the confidence of
all.</p>
<p>It was the unconscious tribute to a whole life and character.&nbsp;
For to a remarkable clearness and vigour of intellect, he added a fairness
of mind, a persuasiveness and courtesy of manner, with an inflexible
uprightness of purpose, which won to him friend and stranger alike.&nbsp;
I have never known any one who was not bettered by his converse, but
I think none outside his own county and society can fully appreciate
the remarkable influence which his name and character - in the later
years it might be truly said &ldquo;clarum et venerabile nomen&rdquo;
- exercised on all with whom he was connected.&nbsp; If indeed he had
a fault, it was that his standard of action was so high, his nature
so absolutely above the littleness of ordinary life, that he attributed
to inferior men far purer and more unselfish objects than those that
really moved them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vixit enim tanquam in Platonis politeia,
non tanquam in Romuli faece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the common fault of biographers to over-colour the character
of a favourite hero, but those who knew Sir William Heathcote will admit
that there is no exaggeration in what I have said.&nbsp; He was the
highest product of a class and school of thought which is fast disappearing,
and which will perhaps find few representatives in the next generation.&nbsp;
With change of time comes also change of men; and the statesmen and
politicians of the new world, whatever their merits or demerits, will
probably be of a very different order from him of whom I am writing.&nbsp;
The old university culture, the fastidious taste, the independence of
thought, the union of political life with county associations - bound
up as they are in this case by a rare intelligence and a moderation
of mind which trimmed, with an almost judicial impartiality, the balance
of thought on all matters submitted to him - are not a combination to
be easily found in any age or society; but it may be safely predicted
that they will be even less common in the coming age than they were
in the generation of which Sir William Heathcote was a representative
and ornament.&nbsp; Be this, however, as it may, I desire, by your favour,
to record here the loss of one who deserved, if ever man did, the name
of an English worthy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This warm-hearted tribute is the exact truth, as all could testify
who ever had occasion to ask Sir William&rsquo;s advice or assistance.&nbsp;
Another such testimony must be added, from a speech of Lord Chief Justice
Coleridge at Nobody&rsquo;s Club.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I looked at him from another point of view, and I can tell you only
how he struck me, a man much younger, of different surroundings, differing
from him in many opinions, political and religious.&nbsp; Yet it is
my pride and sorrowful delight to recollect that Sir William Heathcote
gave me his friendship for nearly forty years; and it is not presumptuous
to say that his friendship deepened into affection.&nbsp; I could not
say if I would, and I would not if I could, all that he was to me, how
much of what is best (if there is any) in my life I owe to him, how
much affection and reverence has gone with him to his grave.&nbsp; His
house was open like another home; in joy, and still more in sorrow,
his sympathy was always warm and ready, in trouble and in difficulty
his advice was always at hand.&nbsp; What advice it always was!&nbsp;
What comfort and strength there was in his company!&nbsp; For the time
at least he lifted one up and made one better.&nbsp; Inflexible integrity,
stern sense of duty, stainless honour, these qualities a very slight
acquaintance with Sir William Heathcote at once revealed.&nbsp; But
he had other great qualities too.&nbsp; He was one of the closest and
keenest reasoners I ever knew.&nbsp; He was a man of the soundest and
strongest judgment; and yet full of the most perfect candour and full
of forbearance and indulgence for other men.&nbsp; And for a man of
his intellect, and, indeed, for a man, he was wonderfully modest and
shy, and of a humility which was, as I saw it, profoundly touching.&nbsp;
Yet there was no weakness in him.&nbsp; Not unbecomingly, not one whit
more than was just, he believed in himself, in his position, in his
family; he had dignity true and inborn without the need of self-assertion,
and love and respect towards him went hand in hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Keble once said, coming away from a long talk with him, that
it was like holding intercourse with some old Christian knight.&nbsp;
And so it was . . .</p>
<p>I am not one of those who believe in the degeneracy of the race,
and I look forward to the future with hope rather than with dismay.&nbsp;
I believe upon the whole the world improves.&nbsp; It is useless to
be always looking back to be a <i>laudator temporis acti se puero</i>
is placed by the wise and genial Horace to the discredit and not to
the credit of old age.&nbsp; But I do think that each age has its own
virtues, and its own type of excellence, and these do not return.&nbsp;
We may have good things, but we shall not have the same good things.&nbsp;
We shall have, I hope, good men, and great men, and noble men, in time
to come, but I do not think we shall see again a Sir William Heathcote.&nbsp;
That most charming mixture of dignified self respect, with unfailing
gracious courtesy to others, those manners in which frankness and refinement
mingled with and set off each other, that perfect purity of thought
and utterance, and yet that thorough enjoyment of all that was good
and racy in wit or humour - this has passed away with him.&nbsp; So
beautiful and consistent a life in that kind of living we shall hardly
see again.</p>
<p>He was preserved to our time to show us of a later age a perfect
specimen of the old-fashioned, high-bred, highly cultivated county gentleman;
and a finer type of Englishman it is hardly possible to conceive.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These two portraits, they are too true to be called eulogies, thoroughly
describe Sir William as he was in friendship, as he was not only to
his original contemporaries but to their sons, so that he came to be
a generally looked up to father, as it were, to the magistracy of the
county as well as the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A portrait of him by G. Richmond,
Esq., R.A., was subscribed for by the magistracy and placed in the County
Hall, which began to be newly restored under his auspices, so as worthily
to show the work of Henry III. in the beautiful old banqueting hall.</p>
<p>Already, however, a great loss had been suffered in William Crawley
Yonge, who had worked by his side in all his public undertakings, carrying
out all that was done in a spirit of thoroughness that never rested
till perfection had been attained as far as possible.&nbsp; His own
parish of Otterbourne had felt his influence, and was noted for good
order and improvement.&nbsp; Both Otterbourne and Hursley had land in
allotments from at least 1830, long before the arrangement was taken
up by Government.&nbsp; Mr. Yonge&rsquo;s strong churchmanship and deep
religious feeling told on all around, and there was a strong sense of
his upright justice, as much as his essential kindness.&nbsp; The end
came suddenly; apoplexy brought on by the hurry and confusion of sending
off his only son, Julian Bargus Yonge, in the Rifle Brigade to the Crimean
War.&nbsp; He died on the 26th of February 1854.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall
we do without him?&rdquo; were the first words of Sir William Heathcote&rsquo;s
letter to Mr. Keble on receiving the tidings.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned here that six young men from Otterbourne were
concerned in the Crimean War - Captain Denzil Chamberlayne and Julian
B. Yonge, though health obliged the latter to return from Varna, while
the former took part in the famous Balaklava charge, and was unhurt,
though his horse was killed.&nbsp; And four of the privates, John Hawkins,
James and William Mason, and Joseph Knight, of whom only James Mason
lived to return.&nbsp; An inscription built into the wall of the churchyard
records their names, with the inscription, suggested by Mr. Keble, &ldquo;It
is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here William Yonge&rsquo;s daughter must record Sir William&rsquo;s
never-failing kindness to her mother and herself, both in matters of
business and in personal criticism, and assistance in those matters
in her works in which the counsel of a man acquainted with the law is
needful to prevent mistakes.&nbsp; Indeed, in the discussions on character
and adventures, nothing was ever more evident to her than that she was
talking (as Mr. Keble said) to a true specimen of the most pure-minded
chivalry.</p>
<p>On 16th September 1868 Sir William retired from Parliament, and,
on the 9th of August 1870, was sworn of the Privy Council.&nbsp; This
appointment gave him the greater satisfaction as a testimony to his
consistent integrity through his whole parliamentary career, as it came
from the Gladstonian ministry, and he had been forced by his deep Church
and State convictions to separate from Mr. Gladstone, the friend and
fellow-worker of his younger days.</p>
<p>His last great public achievement was the rebuilding and improvement
of the County Hospital.&nbsp; Winchester had been the first provincial
city to possess a County Hospital, and the arrangements had grown antiquated
and by no means accordant with more advanced medical practice.&nbsp;
A subscription was raised, and with the warm co-operation of Warden
Robert S. Barter of Winchester College, the present building was erected,
on Mr. Butterfield&rsquo;s plans, in a more healthy and airy situation,
in the year 1868, with a beautiful chapel for the nurses and patients,
and with the modern system of nursing carried out.&nbsp; As was said,
when in 1878 Sir William resigned the post of Chairman of the Committee,
he was the father and the founder of the institution.</p>
<p>Few men have earned by a lifetime so much honour, gratitude, and
affection as he by one consistent, upright course of life, or have left
a nobler memory.</p>
<p>A few words we must give to the festivals.&nbsp; There was the yearly
distribution of Christmas beef to all the labourers and artisans employed
on the estate, and widows.&nbsp; There was occasionally a grand &ldquo;beating
of the bounds&rdquo; of the Manor of Merdon, followed by a dinner in
a tent to the tenants, at which the &ldquo;Lord of the Manor&rdquo;
made a speech, hoping that in times to come the days of &ldquo;the Old
Sir William&rdquo; might be kindly remembered; and somewhat later there
were private theatricals, performed chiefly by the family, which were
a great pleasure to friends and tenants.</p>
<p>What a centre of hospitality, cheerfulness, and kindness Hursley
Park was in those days can hardly be described, though remembered by
many as a sort of golden age of Hursley.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XII - HURSLEY VICARAGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Golden Age of Hursley did not deduce all its honour from the
manor house.&nbsp; The vicarage was perhaps the true centre of the light
which the Park reflected, or rather both knew that their radiance alike
came from One Source above, in whose Light they sought to walk.</p>
<p>The happy, sometimes playful, intercourse between them may perhaps
best be exemplified by the petition sent up by Mr. Keble on an alarm
that the copse on Ladwell hill was about to be cut down in obedience
to the dicta of agricultural judges who much objected to trees and broad
hedgerows.</p>
<p>Ladwell, or as it probably ought to be, Ladywell hill, is a steep
bank, thickly clothed with trees and copsewood, with cottages nestling
under it, on the southward road from Hursley, and on the top the pathway
to Field House, the farm rented by Dr. Moberly, Headmaster of Winchester
College (since Bishop of Salisbury) as the holiday resort of his family.&nbsp;
It is a delightful place, well worthy of the plea for its preservation.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>TO THE LORD OF THE MANOR OF MERDON.</p>
<p>THE PETITION OF SUNDRY LIFE-TENANTS OR HEREDITARY DENIZENS OF THE
SAID MANOR.</p>
<p><i>Humbly Sheweth</i>,<i> -<br /></i>That by custom of this clime,<br />Even
from immemorial time,<br />We, or our forefathers old<br />(As in Withering&rsquo;s

dear<br />All the spring-tide hours we spend,<br />Hiding, seeking without
end.<br />And sometimes a merry train<br />Comes upon us from the lane:<br />Every
gleaming afternoon<br />All through April, May, and June,<br />Boys

we&rsquo;ve heard him say,<br />&ldquo;Thanks that I may hither stray,<br />Worn

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The young flow&rsquo;ret newly blown&rdquo; was Sir William&rsquo;s
son Godfrey, who faded at seven years old.&nbsp; When his mind was wandering,
one of his dreamy utterances was, &ldquo;I should like to fly softly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And therefore Mr. Keble suggested that the words on his little grave
(outside the mausoleum) should be &ldquo;Who are these that fly as a
cloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intercourse of the vicarage with the Park, as with all this neighbourhood,
was affectionate, intimate, or neighbourly and friendly, according as
there was likeness of mind.&nbsp; The impression left was always a cheerful
one of hospitality and of a kind of being on holy ground.&nbsp; The
house stands on the side of a rapid slope from the Park, with a terrace
raised on brick arches overlooking the lawn, only separated by a low
wall from the Churchyard.&nbsp; Here, in early summer, the school children
from both the outlying congregations met those of Hursley at tea, and
for games in the Park, ending with standing round in the twilight below
the terrace, and singing the National Anthem and Bishop Ken&rsquo;s
Evening Hymn.&nbsp; The Anniversary of the Consecration Day, falling
late in the autumn, was the occasion of a feast for the elders of the
parish above sixty years old.&nbsp; This followed, of course, on festal
services, when those who heard it can hardly forget a sermon of Warden
Barter&rsquo;s on the 134th Psalm, when, with the noble sweetness of
his countenance lighted up, he spoke of our delight in nature being
the joy of a child in the beauty of his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>A new organ had been given, and the choir had been brought to great
improvement during the few years that the Rev. W. Le Geyt was at Hursley.&nbsp;
Also a mission school chapel had been built at Pitt, a hamlet on the
downs towards Winchester, and a second curate had been added to the
staff.&nbsp; The present writer can only dwell with thankfulness too
deep to be spoken on Mr. Keble&rsquo;s influence, not so much friendly
as fatherly, and he was the best and kindest of critics in literary
affairs.</p>
<p>But throughout, the vicar was the personal minister to each individual
of his flock - teaching in the school, catechising in the church, most
carefully preparing for Confirmation, watching over the homes, and,
however otherwise busied, always at the beck and call of every one in
the parish.&nbsp; To the old men and women of the workhouse he paid
special attention, bringing them little dainties, trying to brighten
their dull minds as a means of reaching their souls, and endeavouring
to raise their spirits to higher things.&nbsp; One who had been removed
to another Union, when asked how he liked Hursley, said, &ldquo;It seemed
as if they was saying Holy, Holy, Holy, all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time Mr. Keble wrote his <i>Life of Bishop Wilson</i>,
making two visits to the Isle of Man to study the situation and the
documents there preserved; various of the &ldquo;Plain Sermons&rdquo;;
some controversial pamphlets defending the cause of the Church; and
above all, the treatise on &ldquo;Eucharistic Adoration.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He assisted Dr. J. M. Neale in drawing up the <i>Salisbury Hymnal</i>,
a precursor of <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, and contributed several
hymns, especially those for Rogation days, for the service for Holy
Matrimony, and a very grand one for the Feast of St. John the Evangelist,
which has not found place in <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern.</i></p>
<p>All this time he was the prime counsellor and assistant to many engaged
in church work or church defence, among whom may be mentioned Dr. Pusey,
Bishop Alexander Forbes of Brechin, Bishop Walter Hamilton of Salisbury,
the Rev. W. J. Butler of Wantage (Dean of Lincoln), and Canon Liddon.&nbsp;
To them Hursley Vicarage was a place of holy counsel and peaceful rest.</p>
<p>Bishop Robert Gray of Capetown, and the great Bishop George Augustus
Selwyn, were warmly welcomed there on their visits to England; and the
young son of the last-mentioned, John Richardson Selwyn, when left in
England for education, often happily spent part of his holidays there.&nbsp;
No doubt this had a share in his preparation for his future work in
Melanesia, closed early by the failure of health that brought him, after
a few more years, to his grave.</p>
<p>Another guest was Queen Emma of the Sandwich Isles, literally the
Queen of the South, come to hear the wisdom of the Saint; and last of
all, the friend and partner of his earlier work, the sharer in the revival
of the Church from her torpid repose, John Henry Newman, who met Dr.
Pusey there for one last day, fulfilling the words written long before
-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yet deem not on such parting sad<br />Shall dawn no welcome dear
and glad.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But neither of these two last visits took place till after the changes
of old age had begun at Hursley.</p>
<p>The first great sorrow came in the death of Elisabeth, the wise,
gentle, and quiet invalid sister who had been always part of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s
life, and seemed, above all, to diffuse about her an atmosphere of peace
and holiness.&nbsp; After a gradual, almost imperceptible decay, she
sank to sleep on the 7th of August 1860.&nbsp; Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s always
frail health began to fail more and more, so that winters in a warmer
climate became necessary.&nbsp; Dawlish, Penzance, and Torquay were
resorted to in successive winters, and Mr. Keble began to revolve the
question whether it might not become his duty to resign the living,
where, to his own humble apprehension, all his best efforts had failed
to raise the people to his own standard of religion.&nbsp; However,
this was averted, and he was still at his post when, on the night of
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day, the 30th of November 1864, as he was sitting
up writing to Dean Stanley on a passage of which he disapproved in the
<i>History of the Jewish Church</i>, the hand of warning touched him
with a slight stroke of paralysis.&nbsp; With complete rest at Torquay
and Penzance during the winter, he recovered to a considerable degree,
and came home to resume many of his usual habits, but Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s
suffering from spasmodic asthma had become very frequent, and it became
necessary, early in the autumn, to remove to Bournemouth.</p>
<p>There they remained, she gradually sinking, and only distressed at
the thought of his being left; he bearing up in silent resignation and
prayer till, on the 22nd of March, a mistake in using a cold instead
of a hot bath brought on a shock, and in four days more, on Maundy-Thursday
the 29th of March 1866, the voice of Hursley and Otterbourne was, &ldquo;Thy
master is taken from thy head to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was granted to
her to be at rest concerning him before she followed, six weeks later,
on the 11th of May, to the double grave.</p>
<p>It was on a beautiful day, with the celandines shining like stars
on the bank, that we laid him in his grave, a concourse of sorrowing
friends being present, who could look to him as having wakened and cherished
their best aspirations; and those who had come under his personal influence
feeling that a loved father had been taken away.&nbsp; It was on that
day that Alexander Forbes, Bishop of Brechin, Dr. Pusey, Dean Hook,
Sir William Heathcote, Dean Butler, and others, decided that the most
fitting memorial would be the building of the College at Oxford which
bears his name, and is pledged to Church principles, and to a scale
of expenses not beyond the reach of less wealthy students.&nbsp; A monument
was in due time raised above the graves, designed by Mr. Butterfield
- Mr. Keble&rsquo;s in red granite, Mrs. Keble&rsquo;s in Derbyshire
marble.</p>
<p>The place in the chancel where the coffin of John Keble, priest of
the parish, had been placed before the morning&rsquo;s Celebration,
was marked by a brass cross given by the parishioners, who more and
more felt that they had had among them a saint of God, and can hardly
fail to think of him when they sing, &ldquo;O ye holy and humble men
of heart, bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII - LATER CHANGES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the October of 1853, the Rev. Robert F. Wilson having resigned
the curacy of Ampfield, he was replaced by the Rev. John Frewen Moor,
who on 12th January of the next year became perpetual curate and by
and by vicar.</p>
<p>Improvements in the church advanced in his time.&nbsp; The stained
glass of the east and west windows of the church were given by Sir William
and Lady Heathcote, the south-east window is a memorial of Mr. Keble,
the other south windows of Mr. Moor&rsquo;s three sons, one of whom
was drowned while preparing for mission work in Newfoundland, and another
died on his return from what was truly a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>On Mr. Keble&rsquo;s death, the Rev. James Gavin Young, brother to
the much beloved curate, the Rev. Peter Young, was presented to the
living of Hursley.</p>
<p>In 1871 the Rev. William Bigg Wither, after thirty-five years&rsquo;
diligent work in the parish, decided on accepting the rectory of Hardwicke
in Buckinghamshire.&nbsp; Great improvements had taken place in his
time, and he was greatly beloved by his flock, from whom, for nearly
forty years, he had never been absent for a single Sunday, and during
all that time had given them the privilege of daily matins and evensong.</p>
<p>As he never liked the acceptance of testimonials, it was resolved
that, in memory of his long services, a new girls&rsquo; school should
be built, the old one having become quite insufficient, and with it
a master&rsquo;s house with a tower to contain a village clock, which
was given out of the savings of Mrs. Smith and her sister and brother
Miss and Mr. Pink, a kind old thatcher, who will long be remembered.</p>
<p>In that year, 1869, Bishop Sumner resigned the see of Winchester,
and for three years the diocese had the benefit of the great powers
and eloquence of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, whose Confirmation addresses
at each of the churches will be remembered for life by his candidates.</p>
<p>The Rev. Walter Francis Elgie became Mr. Young&rsquo;s curate at
Otterbourne, and in 1875 the first vicar thereof, Sir William Heathcote
having arranged the means of undoing Bishop Pontissara&rsquo;s injustice.&nbsp;
This was rendered practicable by the liberality of Mrs. William Gibbs,
who purchased the advowson of Otterbourne for a sum that Sir William
applied to the endowment of Hursley, so as to compensate for the loss
of the tithes of Otterbourne.</p>
<p>By this time a considerable industry had grown up at Allbrook with
a saw mill and brick making, and the inhabitants, with a little assistance,
erected a mission chapel and school.&nbsp; There the kind and excellent
Rowland Jones Bateman, Esquire, of the Grange, gave hearty assistance
as a teacher, and latterly as a licensed reader, being thus appointed
by Bishop Edward Harold Browne, who succeeded to the See of Winchester
on the sudden death of Bishop Wilberforce.</p>
<p>He came to reconsecrate Otterbourne Church, when an apse had been
added to the choir, and several other alterations made, with the view
of rendering it more suitable for devout worship than knowledge or means
had made practicable when the church was built; and other alterations
have since been made in the same direction.</p>
<p>The kindly and open-hearted Squire of Cranbury, Thomas Chamberlayne,
Esq., died on October 1876, being succeeded by his son Tankerville Chamberlayne,
Esq.; and Brambridge, after descending from the Smythes to a niece,
the Honourable Mrs. Craven, whose son sold it, has since several times
changed owners.</p>
<p>On the 25th February 1881, Otterbourne lost the first vicar, Mr.
Elgie, and the Rev. Henry Walter Brock was presented to the vicarage,
when many improvements were further carried on.</p>
<p>But change and decay mark every generation in turn, and there is
little else to record.&nbsp; The joyous genial days at Hursley Park
had passed away, and the days of agricultural depression had set in,
causing much trouble and anxiety, with alterations met with simple bravery
and cheerfulness, according with the character that could bear adversity
as nobly as prosperity.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Mozley, in the somewhat discursive reminiscences
of his latter years, declares that long before, he had seen one of Mr.
Keble&rsquo;s curates in tears at the possibility of the repeal of the
Corn-Laws causing Sir William Heathcote to put down one of his equipages.&nbsp;
None of the curates could recollect the occasion, and certainly they
lived to see what might have been more deplored, for at the end of Sir
William&rsquo;s life there were actually only two little ponies in his
stables.</p>
<p>Though never a very strong man, he preserved all his powers and his
kind interest and thorough attention to whatever was brought before
him until the end came, as to &ldquo;a shock of corn in full season,&rdquo;
and he was taken to his rest on the 17th of August 1881, leaving to
all who knew him the precious recollection of emphatically &ldquo;a
just man&rdquo; serving God in his generation.</p>
<p>That simple walking funeral, devoid of all pomp or show, but attended
by at least 130 friends, did indeed show the esteem in which he was
held as the moving spring of all the best undertakings for many years
in the county; and may Hursley never forget that she is, as it were,
consecrated by having been the home of two such men as John Keble and
William Heathcote.</p>
<p>Still there are changes to record: Julian Bargus Yonge, after long
inactivity from broken health, sold the property at Otterbourne to Major
Robert Scarlett, and removed to London, where he died a few days later,
in October 1891.</p>
<p>In 1892 Mr. Brock was invited to return to his house in Guernsey
to become rector of the parish of St. Pierre au Bois in succession to
his father and grandfather, and the Rev. Henry Albany Bowles became
vicar of Otterbourne.</p>
<p>Other changes had in the meantime taken place.&nbsp; The Hursley
estate, including not only the Manor of Merdon but recent purchases,
had become much encumbered from the inevitable consequences of agricultural
depression, and after the provision for the family had been made, of
whom there were ten survivors besides Lady Heathcote, it proved that
the only way of clearing off the various liabilities was to sell.</p>
<p>Lady Heathcote gave up her right to a life residence at Hursley Park,
and after 170 years of possession, during which the family had well
merited general affection and esteem, they resigned themselves to the
sale of the greater part of the property.&nbsp; The Park, the advowson
of the living, and the greater part of the parish, were bought by Joseph
Baxendale, Esq., in 1888.</p>
<p>The more distant portions were more gradually disposed of, and recently
the ground of Cranbury Common and Hiltingbury has risen in value from
brick-making industries, and the convenience of Chandler&rsquo;s (or
Chaloner&rsquo;s) Ford Station, and a large and rising colony, on the
confines of five parishes, Otterbourne, North Stoneham, Ampfield, Hursley,
and Baddesley.&nbsp; A school chapel was raised, but soon proved insufficient,
and there is now a church.&nbsp; The place has been formed into a separate
parish, Otterbourne resigning the hamlet of Fryern Hill; Ampfield, part
of Fryern Hill and numerous houses built among the plantations of Cuckoo
Bushes and Cranbury Common; and Stoneham, many houses placed among the
trees of the former Fleming property.</p>
<p>And another change took place, Mr. Frewen Moor, from increasing age
and loss of eyesight, resigned the pastoral charge he had so carefully
and affectionately fulfilled for forty-four years, and was succeeded
by the Rev. Vere Awdry.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV - A SURVEY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It may be best to conclude with a sketch of the present appearance
of the parishes (in 1898).</p>
<p>To begin at the west, where the border is on Romsey, Michelmersh
and Farley, the Romsey road, formerly the direct road from Winchester
to Salisbury, running through it, beside Ampfield Church and village.&nbsp;
This is high ground, and Ampfield Wood extends along it to the borders
of Hursley Park.&nbsp; It is chiefly of oak, fir, and beech, and on
the southern side are the fine arcades of beechwood that Mr. Keble used
to call Hursley Cathedral.&nbsp; From one point in the wood long sight
can distinguish a sort of needle which is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp;
The wood is very old, probably primeval, as it is guarded in the oldest
notices of the Manor of Merdon, and it contains a flora of its own,
in which may be mentioned that rare and beautiful <i>Melittis Melissophyllum</i>,
bastard balm, like a purple and white archangel.&nbsp; The bilberry
is plentiful there and all along the beautiful park-like road to Romsey
and Salisbury.&nbsp; The church, raised above the wayside fountain,
and the churchyard full of very beautiful varieties of pine, still nestles
into the wood, and there is a charming view over the open country towards
the south.</p>
<p>Farley Chamberlayne, which joins the wood on the other side, rising
much higher, has a monument viewed from all the country round, erected
by one of the St. John family to a horse which leapt down with him into
a chalk-pit of considerable depth, and so alighted that neither horse
nor man was hurt, and the horse won the cup at the races the year after,
under the name of Beware Chalk-Pit.&nbsp; Parnholt wood, that clothes
one side of the mount, is beloved by botanists for possessing tracts
of lily of the valley, <i>Convallaria majalis</i>, and likewise <i>Paris
quadrifolia</i>, a great rarity.&nbsp; The mount itself is bare chalk
down, <a name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154">{154}</a> but
has a wonderful view over the whole undulating country - to the southward
the beginning of forest land, and to the south-east, where the beechwoods
of South Lynch begin to creep up the rapid slope of chalk, there is
delightful hunting ground; for bee orchis (<i>Ophrys apifera</i>) swarm;
careful search may discover the brown velvet blue-eyed fly, <i>Ophrys
muscifera</i>, the quaint <i>man</i> and <i>dwarf</i> orchis can be
found; butterfly or honey-suckle orchis, <i>Habenaria</i>, as we are
constrained to term it, is frequent; and where the beech-trees begin
there are those curious parasites which are the only plants they tolerate,
the <i>Listera Nidus-avis</i>, birds&rsquo;-nest orchis, the <i>Monotropa
Hypopitys</i>, or yellow birds&rsquo;-nest, the beautiful lily-like
<i>Epipactis Grandiflora</i>; while helleborine and the curious and
capricious tooth-wort, <i>Spir&aelig;a Filipendula</i> or drop-wort,
<i>Gentiana Amarella</i>, and other distinctive chalk-down plants are
found.</p>
<p>On the southern side of Ampfield lies the parish of North Baddesley,
which preserves the curious old Hampshire village church with a timber
bell turret.&nbsp; This side is where there once stood a Gospel oak,
marking the place where the Gospel was read, when the bounds of the
Manor of Merdon were trod at Rogation-tide.&nbsp; The whole tract is
an extension of the New Forest land, almost all heather and bog, undulating
and, in the drier spots, growing bushes of the glistening holly.&nbsp;
It is forest scenery without the trees, excepting the plantations of
fir made by a former generation, but presenting grand golden fields
of gorse in the spring, and of red and purple heather in early autumn;
and whereas the northern side of Hursley gives the distinctive flora
of dry chalk, here we have the growth of the black peaty bog, the great
broom-rape, brown and leafless, growing on the roots of the gorse; the
curious dodder spreading a tangled red skein of thread over it gemmed
with little round white balls, the rare marsh cinquefoil, the brilliant
yellow asphodel, the delicate, exquisite, bog pimpernel, the blue skull-cap,
the two weird and curious sun-dews, and even in former times the beautiful
dark blue <i>Gentiana Pneumonanthe</i>, as well as the two pinguiculas
- <i>Vulgaris</i>, like a violet, and the rarer <i>Lusitanica.</i></p>
<p>But alas! the giant called &ldquo;High Farming&rdquo; is an enemy
to the botanists, and had starved out many of the choicest of these,
even before the building of villas at Chandler&rsquo;s Ford put a total
end to most of them.</p>
<p>Hursley Park touches on one side the forest land of Ampfield Wood,
and on the other the chalk of the South Downs, and it shows its length
of having been reclaimed in the well-kept trees with their straight
lines finishing their foliage beneath, due to the feeding of deer and
cattle.&nbsp; Its chief beauty is when the thorns are like masses of
snow.&nbsp; Moreover, there grows up from the moat at Merdon, over the
back of the remains of the gateway, a traveller&rsquo;s joy with an
enormous trunk that must be of many years&rsquo; duration.&nbsp; Merdon
Castle is just where the chalk begins, and from thence, running down
to the house itself, there is a broad level space of deer park clear
of trees, and making a fit setting to the early Georgian red brick house
with the gardens on the other side, containing several fine old lime-trees.&nbsp;
On all the sides, except towards Ampfield, the ground falls away, and
the village of well-kept, picturesque cottages lies in the valley beneath
the park, the tall white spire of the church making a beautiful object
looking along the walnut avenue leading from the gardens.</p>
<p>The lime-trees enclose the church on three sides most fitly, except
in the eyes of an old woman, some sixty years ago, who objected to worshipping
in a grove.</p>
<p>At a short distance eastward of the churchyard begin the two roads,
both leading to Otterbourne; the northern one, part of which still bears
the name of King&rsquo;s Lane, is said to have been the way taken by
Purkis&rsquo;s cart when bringing William Rufus&rsquo;s body to Winchester.</p>
<p>The southern road, which is part of the Romsey and Southampton highway,
soon rises into the height of Ladwell Hill, fields with very fine elms
bordering it on the west, and the copse of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s petition
on the east.&nbsp; At the gate of the wood is a patch of the rare <i>Geranium
Ph&aelig;un</i>, the dusky crane&rsquo;s-bill, but whether wild, or
a stray from a disused garden, is doubtful.</p>
<p>After another dip, the road to Otterbourne leaves the main one, and
skirts Cranbury Park, and has on the opposite side the once open country,
since planted first with trees and later with houses, leading to Chandler&rsquo;s
Ford.&nbsp; The very pretty and uncommon <i>Linaria repens</i>, a toad
flax, white and striped with purple, is a speciality that it is hoped
may not be smothered with houses and gardens.&nbsp; A lane, called even
in 1588 Mallibar, runs southward over the heath, and emerges into the
Southampton road.&nbsp; It is a grand place for heath, ferns, and broom-rape,
with daffodils in a field at the end.&nbsp; There are remains of a farm-yard
and orchard, once apparently rented by Mr. Coram of Cranbury.</p>
<p>Cranbury Park is on a hill, intersected by various springs, and where
the peaty ground soon gives way to gravel.&nbsp; The house, a large
red brick one, built round a court, so that it looks low in proportion
to its width, is on the level ground at the top, flat as it fronts to
the south, but in the rear descending rapidly.&nbsp; In fact, on that
side the grounds have the air of cresting the hill, and there is a group
of exceedingly tall pine-trees which are a land-mark of the country
on all sides, though the tallest of them was blown down a few years
ago.&nbsp; Near them is one of the old-fashioned orangeries, with a
great deal of wall and very little glass, and near it stands the sundial
of Newtonian fame.</p>
<p>From the ridge where the pines stand the ground descends through
very steep fields belonging to the Home Farm at Longmore to King&rsquo;s
Lane, where Hursley parish touches upon Compton, at the hamlet of Silkstede,
which is reported to have been a priory, and has a fine old barn and
a dell in the orchard full of snowdrops.&nbsp; No mention of it is in
Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon</i>, and it was probably only a grange;
but it still owns some very fine old trees, the bordering copses are
full of violets, and the rare <i>Lathyrus Nissolia</i> has been found
there.</p>
<p>Returning to the open park in front of Cranbury, there occurs that
fitfully blooming plant, lady&rsquo;s-tresses - <i>Neottia Spiralis
autumnalis</i> - and a profusion of brown-winged orchis and cowslips.&nbsp;
All the slopes are covered with copsewood, much of it oak, the tints
of which are lovely shades of green in spring and golden-brown in early
autumn.&nbsp; The whole is a place remarkable for masses of blossom.&nbsp;
There are giant garlands of white wild cherry above in spring, and equally
white anemone below; by and by an acre of primroses growing close together,
not large, but wonderfully thick, a golden river of king-cup between
banks of dog&rsquo;s mercury, later on whole glades of wild hyacinth,
producing a curious effect of blue beneath the budding yellow green
of the young birches with silver stems.&nbsp; Sheets of the scarlet
sorrel by and by appear, and foxgloves of all sizes troop in the woods,
and are succeeded by the rose bay willow herb, and lastly come perfect
clouds of the little devils&rsquo;-bit scabious.&nbsp; Ferns adorn the
watery glens, and bracken spreads on the undulating ground in wild beauty
of form, here and there enhanced by a bright faded tint of gold.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, close to Otterbourne Church, the gravel
has given place to clay.&nbsp; On the side of the hill, a rough hedge
divides the private ground of the copse from Otterbourne Common and
Hill, which is crossed by the old high road from London to Southampton,
the very steep hill having had a cutting made through it.&nbsp; The
Cranbury side of the road has the village cricket ground on it, though
burrowed under by the concentric brick-work circles of the Southampton
Company&rsquo;s water works, which are entered by a little staircase
tower, cemented over so as to be rather ornamental than otherwise.&nbsp;
Beside it, there is a beautiful view of a delightful home landscape;
stretching out on the south lie woods and low hills to the gleam of
Southampton Water, the smoke of the steamers, and even the gray hills
of the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; On the other side, beyond the rich water
meadows of the Itchen valley, may be seen the woods of Colden Common
rising into Concord Hill, and beyond them the view is closed by the
broken outline of Longwood Warren.&nbsp; While more to the north there
is visible the round smooth outline of &ldquo;the beech-crowned steep&rdquo;
of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; It is a charming prospect, especially
on a day of sunshine and clouds, making shadows chase one another over
the distance.&nbsp; Nor, except for a white thatched cottage and an
extensive gravel-pit by the road, have the native charms of the hill
been much disturbed; and gorse, heather, and honeysuckle flourish till,
where the clay begins, there is a grassy slope bearing a few elms and
horse-chestnuts.&nbsp; Perhaps loaded waggons drop some of their seeds,
for on those cuttings through the gravel on the road-side have sprung
up the dainty little yellow stonecrop, <i>Sedum acre</i>, and the Stork&rsquo;s
bill, <i>Erodium moschatum</i>.&nbsp; These are plentifully spread over
the cutting; but the <i>Trifolium arvense</i>, which came for a few
years, seems to have vanished again.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the road lies the village green.&nbsp; The
old cottages used to stand round in an irregular amphitheatre, some
with poplars before them, and the name of Maypole-field (now allotments)
testifies to there having been sports there before the memory of the
present man.&nbsp; The arrangements have been broken by modern building,
but &ldquo;right of common&rdquo; still protects the green expanse for
donkeys and children, including the more youthful cricketers, not yet
promoted to matches.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill extends a large space of woodland known
as Otterbourne Park.&nbsp; The higher part is full of a growth of beautiful
ling, in delicate purple spikes, almost as tall as the hazel and mountain
ash are allowed to grow.&nbsp; On summer evenings it is a place in which
to hear the nightingale, and later to see the glow-worm, and listen
to the purring of the nightjar.&nbsp; It is a very ancient wood, part
of the original grant of St. Magdalen College, and bears plenty of the
yellow cow-wheat which Kingsley holds as the mark of primeval waste-land;
but it is not exceptional in its other plants, except that a spring,
half-way down, has the rare <i>Viola palustris</i> around it.&nbsp;
The whole tract remained untouched till a pleasant residence called
the Grange was taken out of it to the south, at a ground rent, by Rowland
Jones Bateman, Esq., whose beneficent kindness and excellent religious
influence told on all the neighbourhood, and especially on the hamlet
of Allbrook, till his death in 1897.</p>
<p>The parish here borders on Bishopstoke, and the Grange commands a
pleasant view over the water meadows, and up the opposite Bishopstoke
Hill.&nbsp; Otterbourne Park reaches down to where the meadows begin
along the course of the Itchen.</p>
<p>In these meadows, the will-of-the-wisp has undoubtedly been seen,
as well as in a wet field in the central part of the parish; but it
is a disappointing phenomenon - nothing but a misty, pale bluish light,
rather like the reality of a comet&rsquo;s tail, and if &ldquo;he&rdquo;
was by &ldquo;Friar&rsquo;s Lantern led,&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rdquo; must
have had a strong imagination.</p>
<p>Probably drainage, sawmills, and brick-making have exorcised Jack-o&rsquo;-Lantern,
for Allbrook, from a hamlet of four cottages, has grown up into a considerable
village, with a school-chapel of its own, and a large population.&nbsp;
The two farms called Hams and Boyatt border it on the southern or Bishopstoke
side, and on the northern it extends to Highbridge (apparently so called
from the lowness of the bridge), where is another small hamlet, half
Otterbourne half Twyford; and there was for many years a Roman Catholic
chapel attached to a large cottage, and distinguished by a cross.&nbsp;
It was endowed, but nearly all the flock having faded away, the endowment
was transferred to Eastleigh, and it is now inhabited by a market gardener
with numerous glass houses.</p>
<p>It is the real Itchen that is crossed at Highbridge.&nbsp; The canal
goes through Allbrook, but both serve the purpose of irrigation, and
a network of ditches crosses the meadows.&nbsp; Both river and canal,
too, are excellent for fishermen, who in the season can find</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>here and there a lusty trout,<br />And here and there a grayling</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>in the clear stream, which now and then an otter inhabits, soon to
serve as sport for his many enemies.</p>
<p>Smooth and level, the river is still an unfailing source of enjoyment
in the walks along the towing path, when moor-hens are swimming, and
dipping on a glimpse of the spectator; when fish are rising, or sometimes
taking a sudden &ldquo;header&rdquo; into the air and going down with
a splash; when the water-vole rushes for his hole with head just above
the water; when a blue flash of kingfisher darts by, and the deep blue
or green dragon-flies sit on the sedges, or perhaps a tiny May-fly sits
on a rail to shake off its last garment, and come forth a snow-white
fairy thing with three long whisks at the tail.</p>
<p>The <i>real</i> Itchen is the boundary, and beyond lies Brambridge.&nbsp;
But on coming to the bridge over the canal, the road leads westward,
towards Otterbourne Hill.&nbsp; First it skirts a stream, a tributary
to the Itchen, and goes between meadows till the old church is reached,
now only a chancel in the midst of old headstones, and still bordered
with trees on the bank between it and the stream.&nbsp; There are square
brick monuments covered with stone slabs.&nbsp; In the interstices there
used to be a great deal of <i>Adiantum nigrum</i> - black maidenhair,
but it has disappeared.</p>
<p>The flowers are quite different from those of the peaty marshes on
the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed
down from the chalk hills.&nbsp; The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen,
and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be
found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the
curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called
a morning star.&nbsp; Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of
every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that
loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms.&nbsp;
<i>Orchis latifolia</i> is in plenty, and also <i>Orchis incarnata</i>,
sometimes called the Romsey orchis.&nbsp; Of late years the <i>mimulus</i>
has gilded the bank of one of the ditches.&nbsp; Is it compensation
for the <i>Pinguicula vulgaris</i>, which has been drained away, or
the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating?&nbsp;
Higher up the course of the river, <i>Orchis conopsea</i>, long-spurred
and very sweet, the compact <i>Orchis pyramidalis</i>, and the rare
<i>Epipactis palustris</i> are to be found, as well as <i>Campanula
Glomerata</i>, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed
by the railway and the water works.</p>
<p>Otterbourne Farm bounds the churchyard on the west side, and below,
on either side of a low bridge, stand two fine yew trees where boys
in the old church days used to climb and devour the waxen berries with
impunity.&nbsp; Meadows lie on each side the road, and on the left is
a short lane, leading up to the old manor house, the Moat-house but
it is no longer even a farm-house - the moat is choked with mud and
reeds, and only grows fine forget-me-nots, and the curious panel picture
of a battle, apparently between Turks and Austrians, has been removed.&nbsp;
The fields beyond, bordering on Otterbourne Park, are the best for cowslips
in the parish.</p>
<p>Returning into the road, whose proper name is Kiln Lane, the way
leads between two fields, oddly enough called Courtiers, rising a little,
and with a view of Otterbourne Hill, the east side of which, below the
slope of Otterbourne Park, has been laid out in allotments for more
than fifty years, at first by Mr. Yonge, though it has now been taken
in hand by the Parish Council, and it makes a pleasant picture of stripes
of various shades of green and brown with people working in them.&nbsp;
The hedge sweeps round in a curve, leaving a space where stands the
Pound, still sometimes used for straying cattle.&nbsp; The Stocks were
once there, but never used in the memory of man.</p>
<p>The valley is of clay, strong yellow clay favourable to oaks, though
too many have been cut down, whenever they came to a good size in the
hedges; but in the grounds of Otterbourne House, where they have been
undisturbed for at least eighty years, there are a number of very handsome
well-grown trees; and near them is Dell Copse, dug out for the bricks
for the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; and the home of countless
daffodils.&nbsp; Half way up the hill is a small spring, where the water
rises so as to make little jets of sand.&nbsp; It flows down in a gutter
to the green at the opening of Kiln Lane, around the Pound, and here
spreads into a pool, called the Dip Hole, the resort of cows from the
common, and long of village women, as the blue galt below the yellow
clay never affords good water, but this has been remedied by water works.</p>
<p>At this spot Kiln Lane opens into the high-road, and there is a broad
space of green at nearly the bottom of the hill, before the main body
of the village begins.&nbsp; Every line in the place is a curve-hedges,
roads, gardens and all, and this gives the view a peculiar grace, so
that one of the old men used to say he knew not where to find a better
or prettier view than looking down into the village from the hill, and
on far beyond to Owslebury, Crowd Hill, and Longwood Warren, a lovely
home view.</p>
<p>The church stands on the hillside just where the upward road to Cranbury
begins to branch off.&nbsp; The churchyard is full of crosses, a large
granite cross in memory of John Keble as rector in the midst, and there
is a splendid Wellingtonia, or more properly a Sequoia, now about fifty
years old, and overtopping the bell-turret.&nbsp; And the outside space
on this side is scattered with horse chestnuts and elms.</p>
<p>Below are the schools, and the irregular curving street of houses,
thatched, tiled, or slated, in gardens or close to the road.&nbsp; Here
stands Otterbourne House, and, after two large fields, more cottages,
and the vicarage, like the schools, with the fancy brick chimneys moulded
at Hursley.</p>
<p>Not far beyond, the little stream that had crossed the meadows from
the church is spanned by another bridge, belonging to the high-road
from Winchester.&nbsp; Thence may be seen the source of the stream,
in Pool Hole, said to be fed from Merdon well, and now forced to spread
into a bed of watercresses.</p>
<p>And here begins Compton, Silkstede is in sight, and the round of
the parishes is completed with King&rsquo;s Lane, turning to the west
from the high road to Winchester.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV - WORDS AND PHRASES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Before entirely quitting the parish, a few of the older words and
forms of expression may be recorded, chiefly as remembered from the
older generation, for &ldquo;the schoolmaster&rdquo; and the influx
of new inhabitants have changed much that was characteristic of the
genuine West Saxon.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, was there any very pronounced
dialect, like a separate language.&nbsp; The speech is slow, and with
a tendency to make <i>o</i> like <i>aa</i>, as Titus Oates does in <i>Peveril
of the Peak</i>.&nbsp; An Otterbourne man going into Devonshire was
told, &ldquo;My son, you speak French.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one ever showed
the true Hampshire south-country speech and turn of expression so well
as Lady Verney in her <i>Lettice Lisle</i>, and she has truly Hampshire
characters too, such as could once easily be matched in these villages.</p>
<p>The words and phrases here set down are only what can be vouched

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>If possible, a baby was short-coated on Good Friday, to ensure not
catching cold.</p>
<p>The old custom (now gone out) was that farmers should send their
men to church on Good Friday.&nbsp; They used all to appear in their
rough dirty smock frocks and go back to work again.&nbsp; Some (of whom
it would never have been expected) would fast all day.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The 29th of May is still called Shick-shack day - why has never been
discovered.&nbsp; There must have been some observance earlier than
the Restoration, though oak-apples are still worn on that day, and with
their oak sprays are called Shick-shack.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On St. Clement&rsquo;s Day, the 23rd of November, explosions of gunpowder
are made on country blacksmiths&rsquo; anvils.&nbsp; It is viewed as
the blacksmiths&rsquo; holiday.&nbsp; The accepted legend is that St.
Clement was drowned with an anchor hung to his neck, and that his body
was found in a submarine temple, from which the sea receded every seven
years for the benefit of pilgrims.&nbsp; Thus he became the patron of
anchor forgers, and thence of smiths in general.&nbsp; Charles Dickens,
in <i>Great Expectations</i> describes an Essex blacksmith as working
to a chant, the <i>refrain</i> of which was &ldquo;Old Clem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have heard the explosions at Hursley before 1860, but more modern
blacksmiths despise the custom.&nbsp; At Twyford, however, the festival
is kept, and at the dinner a story is read that after the Temple was
finished, Solomon feasted all the artificers except the blacksmiths,
but they appeared, and pointed out all that they had done in the way
of necessary work, on which they were included with high honour.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day, 21st December, is still at Otterbourne held
as the day for &ldquo;gooding,&rdquo; when each poor house-mother can
demand sixpence from the well-to-do towards her Christmas dinner.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Christmas mummers still perambulate the villages, somewhat uncertainly,
as their performance depends on the lads willing to undertake it, and
the willingness of some woman to undertake the bedizening of them with
strips of ribbon or coloured paper; and, moreover, political allusions
are sometimes introduced which spoil the simplicity.&nbsp; The helmets
are generally made of wallpaper, in a shape like <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>
caps, with long strips hanging over so as to conceal the face, and over
the shirts are sewn streamers.</p>
<p>Thus tramp seven or eight lads, and stand drawn up in a row, when
the foremost advances with, at the top of his hoarse voice:</p>
<p>Room, room, brave gallants, room,<br />I&rsquo;m just come to show
you some merry sport and game,<br />To help pass away<br />This cold
winter day.<br />Old activity, new activity, such activity<br />As never
was seen before,<br />And perhaps never will be seen no more.</p>
<p>(Alas! too probably.&nbsp; Thanks to the schoolmaster abroad.)</p>
<p>Then either he or some other, equipped with a little imitation snow,
paces about announcing himself:</p>
<p>Here comes I, Old Father Christmas, Christmas, Christmas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome
or welcome not,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope old Father Christmas<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will
never be forgot.<br />All in this room, there shall be shown<br />The
dreadfullest battle that ever was known.<br />So walk in, St. George,
with thy free heart<br />And see whether thou canst claim peace for
thine own part.</p>
<p>So far from &ldquo;claiming peace,&rdquo; St. George waves (or ought
to wave) his wooden sword, as he clumps forth, exclaiming:</p>
<p>In comes I, St. George, St. George, that man of courage bold,<br />With
my broad sword and spear I won the crown of gold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
fought that fiery dragon,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
drove him to the slaughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
by that means I won<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
King of Egypt&rsquo;s daughter.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if
any man dare enter this door<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
hack him small as dust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after send him to
the cook&rsquo;s shop<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be
made into mince-pie crust!</p>
<p>On this defiance another figure appears:</p>
<p>Here comes I, the Turkish knight<br />Just come from Turkey land
to fight;<br />I&rsquo;ll fight thee, St. George, St. George, thou man
of courage bold,<br />If thy blood be too hot, I&rsquo;ll quickly make
it cold.</p>
<p>To which St. George responds, in the tone in which he would address
a cart-horse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo ho!&nbsp; My little fellow, thou talk&rsquo;st very bold,<br />Just
like the little Turks, as I have been told,<br />Therefore, thou Turkish
knight,<br />Pull out thy sword and fight,<br />Pull out thy purse and
pay,<br />I&rsquo;ll have satisfaction, or thou guest away.</p>
<p><i>Turkish Knight.</i></p>
<p>Satisfaction, no satisfaction at all,<br />My head is made of iron,
my body lined with steel,<br />I&rsquo;ll battle thee, to see which
on the ground shall fall.</p>
<p>The two wooden swords clatter together till the Turkish knight falls,
all doubled up, even his sword, with due regard to his finery; and St.
George is so much shocked that he marches round, lamenting:</p>
<p>O only behold what I have been and done,<br />Cut and slain my brother,
just the evening sun.</p>
<p>Then, bethinking himself, he exclaims:</p>
<p>I have a little bottle, called elecampane,<br />If the man is alive,
let him rise and fight again.</p>
<p>The application of the elecampane so far restores the Turkish knight
that he partly rises, entreating:</p>
<p>O pardon me, St. George, O pardon me, I crave,<br />O pardon me this
once, and I will be thy slave.</p>
<p>Very inconsistently with his late remorse, St. George replies -</p>
<p>I never will pardon a Turkish knight,<br />Therefore arise, and try
thy might.</p>
<p>The combat is renewed, and the Turkish knight falls prostrate, on
which the Foreign King comes forward, shouting:</p>
<p>St. George, St. George, what hast thou done,<br />For thou hast slain
mine only son!</p>
<p>But, after marching round the fallen hero, he cries:</p>
<p>Is there a doctor to be found,<br />That can cure this man lies bleeding
on the ground?</p>
<p>In response, the doctor appears:</p>
<p>O yes, there is a doctor to be found,<br />That can cure this man
lies bleeding on the ground.</p>
<p>The anxious father asks:</p>
<p>Doctor, doctor, what is thy fee?</p>
<p>The doctor replies:</p>
<p>Ten guineas is my fee,<br />But ten pounds I&rsquo;ll take of thee.</p>
<p>The king answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, doctor, but what canst thou cure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s pretensions are high, for he says:</p>
<p>I can cure the ague, palsy, and the gout,<br />And that&rsquo;s a
roving pain that goes within and out;<br />A broken leg or arm, I soon
can cure the pain,<br />And if thou break&rsquo;st thy neck, I&rsquo;ll
stoutly set it again.<br />Bring me an old woman of fourscore years
and ten,<br />Without a tooth in her head, I&rsquo;ll bring her young
again.</p>
<p>The king observes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou be&rsquo;st a noble doctor if that&rsquo;s all true thou
be&rsquo;st talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the doctor, taking to prose, replies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not like those little mountebank doctors that go
about the streets, and say this, that, and the other, and tell you as
many lies in one half-hour as you would find in seven years; but what
I does, I does clean before your eyes, and ladies and gentlemen, if
you won&rsquo;t believe your own eyes, &rsquo;tis a very hard case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king agreeing that it is, the doctor goes to the patient, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a little bottle that I call golden foster drops.&nbsp;
One drop on the root of this man&rsquo;s tongue and another on his crown,
will strike the heat through his body, and raise him off the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the Turkish knight slowly rises and decamps, St. George
exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise, arise, thou cowardly dog, and see how uprightly thou
can&rsquo;st stand.&nbsp; Go home into your own country and tell them
what old England has done for you, and how they&rsquo;ll fight a thousand
better men than you.</p>
<p>This last speech may have been added after the Crimean War, as the
drama was copied out in 1857; but the staple of it was known long before,
though with variations, in different villages, and it always concludes
with little Johnny Jack, the smallest of the troup, with a bundle of
dolls on his back, going round with a jingling money-box, saying:</p>
<p>Here comes I, little Johnny Jack,<br />Wife and family at my back,<br />My
family&rsquo;s large though I am small,<br />And so a little helps us
all.<br />Roast beef, plum pudding, strong beer and mince-pies,<br />Who
loves that better than Father Christmas or I?<br />One mug of Christmas
ale soon will make us merry and sing;<br />Some money in our pockets
will be a very fine thing.<br />So, ladies and gentlemen, all at your
ease,<br />Give the Christmas boys just what you please.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Before Christmas carols had to be reformed and regulated lest they
should be a mere occasion of profanity and rudeness, that curious one
of Dives and Lazarus was occasionally heard, of which two lines could
never be forgotten -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He had no strength to drive them &rsquo;way,<br />And so they licked
his sores.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And when Lazarus afterwards sees &ldquo;Divers&rdquo; &ldquo;sitting
on a serpent&rsquo;s knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Day too survived in a feeble state, with the little voices singing:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>April&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; May&rsquo;s come!<br />Come and see our
garland.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Keble improved the song into:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April&rsquo;s gone, the king of showers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May
is come, the queen of flowers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me something,
gentles dear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a blessing on the year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
my garland give, I pray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words and smiles of
cheerful May;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds of spring, to you we come,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
us pick a little crumb.<br />In the dew of the morning we gathered our
flowers<br />From the woodlands and meadows and garden bowers,<br />And
now we have twisted our garland so gay,<br />We are come here to wish
you a happy May Day.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We cannot but here add an outline of a village character from <i>Old
Times at Otterbourne</i>:-</p>
<p>Mr. William Stainer was a baker.&nbsp; His bread was excellent, and
he was also noted for what were called Otterbourne buns, the art of
making which seems to have gone with him.&nbsp; They were small fair-complexioned
buns, which stuck together in parties of three, and when soaked, expanded
to twice or three times their former size.&nbsp; He used to send them
once or twice a week to Winchester.&nbsp; But though baking was his
profession, he did much besides.&nbsp; He was a real old-fashioned herbalist,
and had a curious book on the virtues of plants, and he made decoctions
of many kinds, which he administered to those in want of medicine.&nbsp;
Before the Poor Law provided Union doctors, medical advice, except at
the hospital, was almost out of reach of the poor.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Yonge, like almost all other beneficent gentlefolks in villages, kept
a medicine chest and book, and doctored such cases as they could venture
on, and Mr. Stainer was in great favour as a practitioner, as many of
our elder people can remember.&nbsp; He was exceedingly charitable and
kind, and ready to give his help so far as he could.&nbsp; He was a
great lover of flowers, and had contrived a sort of little greenhouse
over the great oven at the back of his house, and there he used to bring
up lovely geraniums and other flowers, which he sometimes sold.&nbsp;
He was a deeply religious and devout man, and during an illness of the
clerk took his place in Church, which was more important when there
was no choir and the singers sat in the gallery.&nbsp; He was very happy
in this office, moving about on felt shoes that he might make no noise,
and most reverently keeping the Church clean, and watching over it in
every way.&nbsp; He also continued in the post of schoolmaster, which
at first he had only taken temporarily, and quaintly managing it.&nbsp;
He was found setting as a copy &ldquo;A blind man&rsquo;s wife needs
no paint,&rdquo; which he defended as &ldquo;Proverbs, sir, Proverbs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Giving up part of his business to his nephew, he still sat up at night
baking, for the nephew, he said, was only in the A B C book of baking,
and he also had other troubles: there was insanity in his family, and
he was much harassed.&nbsp; His kindness and simplicity were sometimes
abused.&nbsp; He never had the heart to refuse to lend money, or to
deny bread on credit to hopeless debtors; and altogether debts, distress,
baking, and watching his sisters all night, and school keeping all day,
were too much for him.&nbsp; The first hint of an examination of his
school completed the mischief and he died insane, drowning himself in
the canal.&nbsp; It is a sad story, but many of us will remember with
affectionate regard the good, kind, quaint, and most excellent little
man.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A few lines, half parody, half original, may be added as picturing
the old aspect of Otterbourne, about 1830:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>OLD REMEMBRANCES</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old times at Otterbourne,<br />Before
the building of the Church,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when smock frocks
were worn!</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When railroads there
were none,<br />When by stage coach at early dawn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
journey was begun.</p>
<p>And through the turnpike roads till eve<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trotted
the horses four,<br />With inside passengers and out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
carried near a score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Rover&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Telegraph,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
knew them all by name,<br />And Mason&rsquo;s and the Oxford coach,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full
thirty of them came.</p>
<p>The coachman wore his many capes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard
his bugle blew;<br />The horses were a gallant sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashing
upon our view.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posting days of
old;<br />The yellow chariot lined with blue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
lace of colour gold.</p>
<p>The post-boys&rsquo; jackets blue or buff,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
inns upon the road;<br />The hills up which we used to walk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
lighten thus the load.</p>
<p>The rattling up before the inn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses
led away,<br />The post-boy as he touched his hat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
came to ask his pay.</p>
<p>The perch aloft upon the box,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delightful for
the view;<br />The turnpike gates whose keepers stood<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demanding
each his due.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ships were beauteous
things,<br />The floating castles of the deep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne
upon snow-white wings;</p>
<p>Ere iron-dads and turret ships,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugly as evil
dream,<br />Became the hideous progeny<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of iron
and of steam.</p>
<p>You crossed the Itchen ferry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in an open
boat,<br />Now, on a panting hissing bridge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
scarcely seem afloat.</p>
<p>Southampton docks were sheets of mud,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grim
colliers at the quay.<br />No tramway, and no slender pier <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
stretch into the sea.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long years ere Rowland
Hill,<br />When letters covered quarto sheets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ
with a grey goose quill;</p>
<p>Both hard to fold and hard to read, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed
to the scarlet seal;<br />Hardest of all to pay for, ere<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
news they might reveal.</p>
<p>No stamp with royal head was there, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But eightpence
was the sum<br />For every letter, all alike,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
did from London come!</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mowing of the
hay;<br />Scythes sweeping through the heavy grass <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
breaking of the day.</p>
<p>The haymakers in merry ranks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossing the swathes
so sweet,<br />The haycocks tanning olive-brown <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
glowing summer heat.</p>
<p>The reapers &rsquo;mid the ruddy wheat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
thumping of the flail,<br />The winnowing within the barn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
whirling round a sail.</p>
<p>Long ere the whirr, and buzz, and rush <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became
a harvest sound,<br />Or monsters trailed their tails of spikes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
ploughed the fallow ground.</p>
<p>Our sparks flew from the flint and steel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
lucifers were known,<br />Snuffers with tallow candles came <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
prune the wick o&rsquo;ergrown.</p>
<p>Hands did the work of engines then, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now
some new machine<br />Must hatch the eggs, and sew the seams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
make the cakes, I ween.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homely village
school,<br />The dame with spelling book and rod, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sceptre of her rule.</p>
<p>A black silk bonnet on her head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buff kerchief
on her neck,<br />With spectacles upon her nose, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
apron of blue check.</p>
<p>Ah, then were no inspection days, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No standards
then were known,<br />Children could freely make dirt pies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
learning let alone!</p>
<p>Those Sundays I remember too,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Service
there was one; <br />For living in the parish then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
parsons there were none.</p>
<p>And oh, I can recall to mind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church and
every pew; <br />William and Mary&rsquo;s royal arms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung
up in fullest view.</p>
<p>The lion smiling, with his tongue <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a
pug dog&rsquo;s hung out;<br />The unicorn with twisted horn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooding
upon his rout.</p>
<p>Exalted in the gallery high <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuneful village
choir,<br />With flute, bassoon, and clarionet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
notes rose high and higher.</p>
<p>They shewed the number of the Psalm <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In white
upon a slate,<br />And many a time the last lines sung <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
Brady and of Tate.</p>
<p>While far below upon the floor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the
narrow aisle,<br />The children on their benches sat <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged
in single file.</p>
<p>And there the clerk would stump along <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
strike with echoing blow<br />Each idle guilty little head<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
chattered loud or low.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; I remember many things, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old, middle-aged,
and new;<br />Is the new better than the old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
bright, more wise, more true?</p>
<p>The old must ever pass away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new must
still come in;<br />When these new things are old to you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
they unstained by sin.</p>
<p>So will their memory be sweet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A treasury
of bliss<br />To be borne with us in the days <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
we their presence miss.</p>
<p>Trifles connected with the love <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of many a
vanished friend<br />Will thrill the heart and wake the sense, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
memory has no end!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI - NATURAL HISTORY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Or animal life, though abundant, there is little or nothing special
to record, besides the list of birds.</p>
<p>Polecats and martens only exist in the old rating book, but weasels
and stoats remain, as well as a profusion of their prey - hares and
rabbits.&nbsp; Squirrels haunt the trees, and otters are occasionally
found in the river.&nbsp; Trout, grayling, now and then a pike, as well
as the smaller fry of minnows and sticklebacks, are of course found
in the streams.&nbsp; Eels used to be caught there on the moonlight
nights by old labourers with a taste for sport, and the quaint little
river cray-fish may be picked out of the banks of the &ldquo;water-carriages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toads and frogs are a matter of course.&nbsp; Sometimes a procession
of tiny, but perfectly formed &ldquo;Charley Frogs,&rdquo; as the village
boys call them, just emerged from their tadpole state, may be seen making
their way up from their native pools.</p>
<p>The pretty crested newt, dark brown and orange, with a gold crest
along its back like an iguana, is found in shallow ponds, also the smooth
newt.&nbsp; These efts, or evvets, as the people call them, are regarded
with horror by the peasantry.&nbsp; The children speak of having seen
one as if it were a crocodile; and an abscess in the arm has been ascribed
to having picked up an &ldquo;evvet in a bundle of grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slow-worm, in silvery coat, is too often slaughtered as a snake.&nbsp;
Vipers come to light in the woods, also the harmless brown snake.&nbsp;
One of these has been seen swimming across a pond, his head just out
of the water, another climbing an oak tree, and one, upon the lawn,
was induced to disgorge a frog, which gathered up its legs and hopped
away as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Of rats and mice and such small deer there are only too many, though
it is worth while to watch rats at play round a hay-rick on Sunday evenings,
when they know they will not be persecuted, and sit up like little kangaroos.&nbsp;
The vole, which is not a rat, is a goodly sight, and the smooth round
dormouse (or sleep-mouse, as the children call it) is a favourite gift
imprisoned in an old tea-pot.</p>
<p>The beautiful nest of a field-mouse has been found in a cypress&rsquo;s
thick foliage, and dead shrews bestrew the paths; though the magic effects
of having a &ldquo;sherry mouse&rdquo; die in one&rsquo;s hand, and
thus being enabled to stroke cattle and cure them, have never been experienced.</p>
<p>The <i>anodon</i> or fresh water mussel used to be found in Fisher&rsquo;s
Pond on Colden Common, bordering on Otterbourne, and the green banks
were strewn with shells left by the herons, but the pond is fast drying
up and the herons have been driven away by guns.</p>
<p>The delicate <i>paludina</i>, of brown, horn-coloured, gracefully-formed
shell, creeps on the water weeds, and hosts of snails may be studied.</p>
<p>Of insects less can be said here, but it is worth noting that one
live purple emperor has been captured in Ampfield wood, two dead dilapidated
ones picked up at Otterbourne.</p>
<p>The forest fly, so called, does not often come here; but it is observable
that while strange horses are maddened by it, the native ones do not
seem disturbed, knowing that it only creeps and does not bite.&nbsp;
It is small and brown, not so formidable looking as the large fly, popularly
called a stout, as big as a hornet, which lays eggs under the skin of
cows.</p>
<p>But with the blue, green, and orange dragonflies of summer, this
list must conclude, and turn to the birds and botany of the place, mostly
well known, and verified by Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s <i>Flora of Hampshire.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>BIRDS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>THE KITE (<i>Milvus ictinus</i>). - Sometimes hovering over heathlands
or farmyards, but not very common.</p>
<p>SPARROW-HAWK (<i>Accipiter fringillarius</i>). - Taken in a trap
set for rats at Otterbourne House.</p>
<p>PEREGRINE FALCON (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), Hursley, 1857. - As a
pair for many years had a nest on Salisbury spire, this one may have
flown thus far.</p>
<p>KESTREL (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>) - Otterbourne, 1856.</p>
<p>SHORT-EARED OWL (<i>Otus brachyotus</i>). - Baddesley Common, 5th
March 1861.</p>
<p>WHITE OWL (<i>Strix flammea</i>). - Nested in a barn, another year
in a pigeon-loft, and again in an old tub at Otterbourne.&nbsp; To be
seen skimming softly along on summer evenings.</p>
<p>BROWN OWL (<i>Ulula stridula</i>). - Glides over the fields like
a huge moth, and on moonlight nights in August may be heard the curious
hunting note.&nbsp; As the eggs are hatched, not all at once, but in
succession, a family taken out of a loft and put into a sea-kale pot
were of various ages, the eldest nearly fledged, standing up as if to
guard the nest, the second hissing and snapping, as if a naughty boy,
and two downy infants who died.&nbsp; One brown owl was kept tame, and
lived 14 years.&nbsp; The village people call this bird Screech Owl,
and after a sudden death always mention having heard it.</p>
<p>CHIMNEY SWALLOW (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>). - They chase the flies
under the bridges on the Itchen, and display their red throats.</p>
<p>HOUSE-MARTIN (<i>Hirundo urbica</i>). - Twittering everywhere &rsquo;neath
the straw-built shed.</p>
<p>SAND-MARTIN (<i>Hirundo riparia</i>). - Swarms sit in rows along
the electric wires, and bore deeply into every sand-pit.</p>
<p>SWIFT (<i>Cypselus murarius</i>). - First to come and first to go.&nbsp;
Their peculiar screech and floating flight are one of the charms of
the summer evenings.</p>
<p>NIGHTJAR (<i>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</i>). - All through the twilight
of the long days his purr-purr comes down from the heathery summit of
Otterbourne Hill, where he earns his other name of Fern Owl, and may
be seen flitting on silent wing in search of moths.</p>
<p>KINGFISHER (<i>Alcedo ispida</i>). - This beautiful creature darts
out of the reeds bordering the Itchen, and it used to be at Chandler&rsquo;s
Ford before the place was so populated.&nbsp; It seems also to haunt
ponds or marshy places in woods, for a young full-fledged one was brought
into Otterbourne House by a cat, alive and apparently unhurt.&nbsp;
Another took a fancy to the gold-fish in a stone basin at Cranbury,
and was shot, as the poor fish could not escape.</p>
<p>SPOTTED FLYCATCHER (<i>Muscicapa grisola</i>). - Late in summer these
dainty little birds come whisking about the garden, perching on a rail,
darting off after a fly, returning to the same post, or else feeding
their young in nests on the side of the house.&nbsp; A pair built in
1897 in a flower-pot close to the window of Otterbourne House.</p>
<p>BUTCHER-BIRD (<i>Lanius collurio</i>). - Said to have been seen at
Otterbourne.&nbsp; A slug has been found impaled on a thorn, but whether
this was the shrike&rsquo;s larder, or as a charm for removing warts,
is uncertain.</p>
<p>MISSEL-THRUSH (<i>Merula viscivora</i>). - This handsome bird is
frequent, and commonly called House Screech.&nbsp; A story told by Warden
Barter may be worth preserving.&nbsp; A pair of Missel Thrush seeing
a peacock too near their nest, charged full at him, and actually knocked
him down.</p>
<p>SONG-THRUSH (<i>Merula musica</i>). - Happily everywhere warbling
on warm days in autumn and winter with a sweet, powerful song, some
notes more liquid than even the nightingale&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The shells
of the snails he has devoured bestrew the garden-walks.</p>
<p>BLACKBIRD (<i>Merula vulgaris</i>). - Out, with angry scream and
chatter at the approach of an enemy, darts the &ldquo;ousel cock so
black of hue, with orange-tawny bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; How dull a lawn would
be without his pert movements when he comes down alternately with his
russet wife.&nbsp; One blackbird with a broad white feather on each
side of his tail haunted Elderfield for two years, but, alas! one spring
day a spruce sable rival descended and captivated the faithless dame.&nbsp;
They united, chased poor Mr. Whitetail over the high garden hedge, and
he was seen no more.</p>
<p>REDWING (<i>Merula iliaca</i>). - Not common, but noted by J. B.
Y.</p>
<p>RING-OUZEL (<i>Merula torquata</i>). - Rare, but observed by J. B.
Yonge in Otterbourne Park, 14th September 1865, and it has been seen
several times later.</p>
<p>FIELDFARE (<i>Merula pilaris</i>). - In flocks in winter.</p>
<p>WHEATEAR (<i>Sylvia &aelig;nanthe</i>). - Comes to the downs.</p>
<p>STONECHAT (<i>Saxicola rubicola</i>). - Hops about on stones.</p>
<p>WHINCHAT (<i>Saxicola rubetra</i>). - On furze bushes on Otterbourne
Hill.</p>
<p>REDBREAST (<i>Sylvia rubecula</i>). - A whole brood, two old and
four young, used to disport themselves on the quilt of an old bedridden
woman on Otterbourne Hill.&nbsp; It is the popular belief that robins
kill their fathers in October, and the widow of a woodman declared that
her husband had seen deadly battles, also that he had seen a white robin,
but she possibly romanced.</p>
<p>REDSTART (<i>Ph&aelig;nicura ruticilla</i>). - Sometimes seen, but
not often.</p>
<p>GRASSHOPPER-WARBLER (<i>Salicaria locustella</i>). - Well named,
for it chirps exactly like a grasshopper in the laurels all through
a summer evening.</p>
<p>SEDGE-WARBLER (<i>Salicaria fragilis</i>). - Whoever has heard it
scolding and chattering in a ridiculous rage at a strange footstep will
not wonder at the Scotch name of Blethering Jock.&nbsp; A pair nested
in Dell Copse for some years, and the curious nest has been found among
the reeds on the banks of the Itchen.</p>
<p>NIGHTINGALE (<i>Sylvia luscinia</i>). - Every year about the 18th
of April the notes may be heard by the gate of Cranbury, in a larch
wood on Otterbourne Hill, in the copse wood of Otterbourne House, at
Oakwood, and elsewhere.&nbsp; For about a week there is constant song,
but after nesting begins, it is less frequent.&nbsp; One year there
was a nest in the laurels at Otterbourne House (since taken away), and
at eight in the morning and seven at night the nightingale came on the
lawn to feed, and was every morning chased by a surly John Bull of a
robin.&nbsp; When the young are coming out of the nest the parents chide
them, or strangers, in a peculiarly harsh chirp.</p>
<p>BLACKCAP (<i>Sylvia atricapilla</i>). - Fair and sweet, but not very
frequent; nested in Dell Copse.</p>
<p>WHITETHROAT (<i>Sylvia cinerea</i>). - Darts about gardens, and is
locally called Nettle-creeper.</p>
<p>LESSER WHITETHROAT (<i>S. curruca</i>). - Eggs in Dell Copse.</p>
<p>WOOD-WARBLER (<i>Sylvia sylvicola</i>). - Eggs taken at Cranbury.</p>
<p>WILLOW-WARBLER (<i>Sylvia trochilus</i>). - Eggs taken at Baddesley.</p>
<p>CHIEFCHAFF (<i>Sylvia hippola&iuml;s</i>). - Common in spring.</p>
<p>GOLDEN-CRESTED WREN (<i>Sylvia auricapilla</i>). - A happy little
inhabitant of the fir-trees, where it nests, and it is often to be seen
darting in and out of a quickset hedge.</p>
<p>SKYLARK (<i>Alauda arvensis</i>). - The joy of eyes and ears in every
open field.&nbsp; True to the kindred points of heaven and home.</p>
<p>WOODLARK (<i>Alauda arborea</i>). - Otterbourne Park and Cranbury.</p>
<p>YELLOW-BUNTING or YELLOW-HAMMER (<i>Emberiza citrinella</i>). - A
great ornament, especially in autumn, when it sits on rails, crying,
&ldquo;A little bit of bread and no che-e-ese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>BLACKHEADED or REED BUNTING (<i>Emberiza sch&aelig;nidus</i>). -
Brambridge, April 1896.</p>
<p>SPARROW (<i>Passer domesticus</i>). - One curious fact about this
despised animal is that the retired farmer, after whom Elderfield is
named, made it his business to exterminate the village sparrows.&nbsp;
He often brought them down to one, but always by the next morning that
sparrow had provided himself with a mate to share his Castle Dangerous.&nbsp;
Sparrows&rsquo; (or sprows&rsquo;) heads make a figure in many church
ratebooks.</p>
<p>CHAFFINCH (<i>Fringilla c&aelig;lebs</i>). - Chink is the Hampshire
name.&nbsp; The hens do not here migrate in winter, but a whole flight
of them has been seen in the autumn on the Winchester road, evidently
on their way; and once, after an early severe frost, about a hundred
were found dead in a haystack near Basingstoke.&nbsp; Thomas Chamberlayne,
Esq., who had a singular attraction for birds, used to have them coming
to eat grain from his pocket.&nbsp; It has the perfection of a nest.</p>
<p>GOLDFINCH (<i>Carduelis elegans</i>). - This exquisite little bird
is frequent on the borders of the chalk hills, where there is plenty
of thistledown.</p>
<p>HAWFINCH (<i>Coccothraustes vulgaris</i>). - Sometimes seen, but
not common.</p>
<p>LINNET (<i>Linota cannabina</i>). - Fairly frequent.</p>
<p>GREEN LINNET (<i>Coccothraustes chloris</i>). - Greenfinch, or Beanbird
as they call it in Devonshire, is a pleasant visitor, though it has
a great turn for pease.</p>
<p>WREN (<i>Sylvia troglodytes</i>). - This brisk little being Kitty
Wren is to be seen everywhere.&nbsp; Whether Kingsley&rsquo;s theory
is right that the little birds roll themselves into a ball in a hole
in the winter, I know not.&nbsp; Single ones are certainly to be seen
on a bank on a frosty, sunshiny day.&nbsp; Have they come out to view
the world and report on it?&nbsp; Those very odd, unused nests are often
to be found hanging from the thatch within outhouses.&nbsp; May it be
recorded here that a wren once came to peck the sprigs on Miss Keble&rsquo;s
gown?</p>
<p>GREAT TITMOUSE (<i>Parus major</i>) - or Ox-eye, as he is here called,
bold and bright, crying &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; in early spring, and beautiful
with his white cheek, and the black bar down his yellow waistcoat.</p>
<p>BLUE TIT (<i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>). - Bolder and prettier is
the little blue-cap, a true sprite and acrobat as Wordsworth calls him.</p>
<p>MARSH-TIT (<i>Parus palustris</i>). - Known by less bright colouring
and white breast.</p>
<p>COLE-TIT (<i>Parus ater</i>). - More grey, and very graceful.&nbsp;
All these four will gladly come to a window in winter for a little fat
hung to a string, and will put themselves into wonderful inverse positions.</p>
<p>LONG-TAILED TIT (<i>Parus caudatus</i>). - Long-tailed Caper, as
is his local name, is more shy, and will not come to be fed; but the
antics of a family after they have left their domed nest are delightful
to watch, as they play in the boughs of a fir-tree.</p>
<p>HEDGE-SPARROW (<i>Accentur modularis</i>). - Quiet, mottled bird,
to be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>PIED WAGTAIL (<i>Motacilla lutor</i>). - Most of these stay with
us all winter, but one March evening at least forty-three descended
on the lawn at Elderfield, doubtless halting in their flight from southern
lands.&nbsp; Most winning birds they are, with their lively hop and
jerking tails.&nbsp; Dish-washer is their Hampshire name.</p>
<p>GREY WAGTAIL (<i>Motacilla boarula</i>). - This pretty bird is really
partly yellow.&nbsp; It is not very frequent here, but is sometimes
found on the Itchen bank; likewise the nest in a reedy meadow.</p>
<p>RAY&rsquo;S WAGTAIL (<i>Motacilla Rayi</i>). - Ray&rsquo;s Wagtail
was catching flies on a window at Otterbourne House in 1890.</p>
<p>TREE PITT (<i>Anthus arboreus</i>), MEADOW PIPIT (<i>Anthus pratensis</i>).
- Small brown birds, not easy to distinguish; but the eggs differ, and
both have been found.</p>
<p>BULLFINCH (<i>Pyrrhula vulgaris</i>). - It is charming to greet the
black head and red waistcoat in the tops of the laurels or apple-trees,
and surely this destroyer of insect devourers does more good than harm,
if he does pick the buds to pieces in the search.&nbsp; He is a delightful
pet, of exclusive and jealous attachments, hating every one except his
own peculiar favourite; and his sober-coloured lady has quite as much
character as he.&nbsp; One which was devoted to her own mistress would
assail another of the family with such spite as sometimes to drive her
out of the room.</p>
<p>STARLING (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>). - Green bedropped with gold when
seen closely, but at a distance looking more like a rusty blackbird,
though its gait on the lawn always distinguishes it, being a walk instead
of a hop.&nbsp; Though not tuneful, no bird has such a variety of notes,
and the clatter on the root the call-note, the impatient summons of
the brood about to be fed, make it a most amusing neighbour, when it
returns to the same tree year after year.</p>
<p>RAVEN (<i>Corvus corax</i>). - He has flown over the village several
times.&nbsp; One lived for many years in the yard of the George Inn
at Winchester.</p>
<p>CROW (<i>Corvus coron&aelig;</i>). - Game-preserving has nearly put
an end to him, but he is seen round the folds on the downs in lambing
time.</p>
<p>ROOK (<i>Corvus frugilegus</i>). - Shining and black the great birds
come down on the fields.&nbsp; There is a rookery at Cranbury, another
at Hams Farm at Allbrook, and a considerable one in the beeches near
Merdon, for which the rooks deserted some oak-trees nearer the House.&nbsp;
While these trees were still inhabited, Mr. G. W. Heathcote observed
a number of walnuts under them, and found that the rooks brought them
from the walnut avenues.&nbsp; A parliament of these wise birds is sometimes
held on the downs, and there are woods where they assemble in great
numbers in the autumn, contingents from all lesser rookeries pouring
in to spend the winter, and whirling round and round in clouds before
roosting.</p>
<p>JACKDAW (<i>Corvus monedula</i>). - A very amusing, though very wicked
pet.&nbsp; There used to be throngs of them in the tower of the old
church at Hursley, and their droll voices might be heard conversing
in the evening.&nbsp; Mr. Chamberlayne had one which, after being freed,
always came down to greet him when he walked in the garden.</p>
<p>MAGPIE (<i>Corvus pica</i>). - Pages might be filled with the merry
mischief of this handsome creature.&nbsp; Perhaps the most observable
characteristic of the three tame ones closely observed was their exclusive
and devoted attachment to one person, whom they singled out for no cause
that could be known, and followed about from place to place.</p>
<p>JAY (<i>Garrulus glandarius</i>). - May be heard calling in the pine
plantations on Hursley Common.&nbsp; It would be as amusing as the magpie
if tamed.</p>
<p>GREEN WOODPECKER (<i>Picus viridis</i>). - The laugh and the tap
may be heard all through the Spring days.&nbsp; In 1890 <i>Picus major</i>,
a small, black, and spotted French Magpie, as Devonians call it, was
found, but we have no other right to claim it.</p>
<p>WRYNECK (<i>Yunx torquilla</i>), or Cuckoo&rsquo;s mate, squeaks
all round the woods with his head on one side just as the cuckoo comes.</p>
<p>NUTHATCH (<i>Sitta europ&aelig;a</i>). - This pretty creature will
come and be fed on nuts at windows in the winter.&nbsp; These nuts he
thrusts into crevices of bark to hold them fast while he hammers the
shell.&nbsp; The remains may often be found.&nbsp; For many years a
pair built in a hole half-way down an old apple-tree covered with ivy
at Otterbourne House, and the exertions of the magpie with clipped wing
to swing himself on a trail of ivy into the hole were comical, as well
as his wrath when he fell off, as he uniformly did.</p>
<p>TREE-CREEPER (<i>Certhia familiaris</i>), winds round and round the
trees like a little mouse.</p>
<p>HOOPOE (<i>Upupa vulgaris</i>). - Once in a frost caught alive by
a shepherd on the downs, but it soon died.</p>
<p>CUCKOO (<i>Cuculus canorus</i>). - They cuckoo till &ldquo;in June
he altereth his tune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably the stammer is the effort
of the young ones to sing.&nbsp; One grew up in a wagtail&rsquo;s nest
in the flints that were built into the wall of Otterbourne Churchyard.&nbsp;
Another, carried to the other side of the road and caged, was still
fed by its foster-parents till it was ready to fly.</p>
<p>WOOD-PIGEON (<i>Columba palumbus</i>)<i> -</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Take two cows, Taffy,<br />Taffy, take two-o-o.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Plenty of this immoral exhortation may be heard in the trees.&nbsp;
One young pigeon taken from the nest proved incorrigibly wild and ready
to flutter to death whenever any one came near it.</p>
<p>TURTLE-DOVE (<i>Columba turtur</i>). - This pretty delicate creature
with speckled neck builds in bushes lower than the wood-pigeon, and
the mournful note resounds in the trees.</p>
<p>PHEASANT (<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>). - Not a real native, but cultivated
to any extent.&nbsp; A cock pheasant with the evening sun gilding his
back is a rare picture of beauty.</p>
<p>PARTRIDGE (<i>Tetrao perdix</i>). - Numerous.</p>
<p>HERON (<i>Ardea cinerea</i>). - Sometimes flies far overhead, the
long legs projecting behind.</p>
<p>SANDPIPER (<i>Totanus hypoleucus</i>). - Seen walking over a mass
of weeds in the Itchen canal.</p>
<p>SNIPE (<i>Scolopax gallinago</i>). - Brought in by sportsmen from
the water meadows.</p>
<p>WOODCOCK (<i>Scolopax rusticola</i>). - Not common, but sometimes
shot.</p>
<p>JACK-SNIPE (<i>Scolopax gallinula</i>). - Not common, but sometimes
shot.</p>
<p>LAND-RAIL (<i>Crex pratensis</i>). - Corn-Crake.&nbsp; May be heard
&ldquo;craking&rdquo; in the long grass in early morning before the
hay is cut.</p>
<p>WATER-RAIL (<i>Rallus aquaticus</i>). - In a meadow at Otterbourne,
22nd January 1855.</p>
<p>LITTLE GREBE (<i>Podiceps minor</i>). - Dabchick, as it is commonly
called, swims in the Itchen and in Fisher&rsquo;s Pond (on Colden Common),
dipping down suddenly without a trace of the least alarm.</p>
<p>MOOR-HEN (<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>). - Very similar are the ways
of the moor-hen, with its brilliant beak.&nbsp; But once, by some extraordinary
chance, a moor-hen fell down a cottage chimney, and was brought alive
for inspection by a boy, who, ignorant of natural objects, as was always
the case in villages forty years ago, thought it a rare foreign specimen.&nbsp;
It was a thatched cottage, but if it had been slated the moor-hen might
have taken the roof for a sheet of water by moonlight, as the Great
Water-Beetle has been known to do, and come down the chimney in like
manner.&nbsp; A brood comes constantly to be fed on a lawn at Bishopstoke.</p>
<p>PEEWIT (<i>Vanellus cristatus</i>). - Otherwise the Crested Lapwing.&nbsp;
It floats along in numbers when migrating, the whole flock turning at
the same time and displaying either the dark or the white side of their
wings with a startling effect.&nbsp; They seem effaced for a moment,
the next the white sails are shown, then gone again.&nbsp; When paired,
and nesting in the meadows, their cry causes their local name, as their
other English title is derived from their characteristic man&oelig;uvres
to lead the enemy from their young.&nbsp; Did they learn the habit when
their so-called plovers&rsquo; eggs became a dainty?</p>
<p>GOLDEN PLOVER (<i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>). - Noted at Otterbourne
meadows by J. B. Yonge.</p>
<p>WILD DUCK (<i>Anas boschas</i>). - The mallard is splendid in plumage,
and in shape is far more graceful than his domesticated brother.&nbsp;
In early winter the wild ducks fly overhead in a wedge-shaped phalanx,
and by and by they pair, and if disturbed start up with a sudden quack,
quack from the copse-wood pond.&nbsp; Broods of downy wild ducks have
been brought in by boys, but it has almost always proved impossible
to rear them.</p>
<p>TEAL (<i>Querquedula anas</i>). - This very pretty little duck used
to build on Cranbury Common, but may have been frightened away by increasing
population.</p>
<p>GULL (<i>Larus canus</i>). - Flocks of those white-breasted birds
sometimes alight on ploughed fields round Otterbourne, and even some
miles farther from the sea.&nbsp; They are sometimes kept in gardens
to destroy the slugs.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These birds have all been actually seen and noted down by members
of the Yonge family.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>FLOWERS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>TRAVELLER&rsquo;S JOY (<i>Clematis Vitalba</i>). - Locally called
Old Man&rsquo;s Beard, most appropriately, as its curling, silvery masses
of seeds hang in wreaths over the hedges.&nbsp; There is a giant trunk
growing up from the moat of Merdon Castle.</p>
<p>MEADOW RUE (<i>Thalictrum flavum</i>). - Handsome foliage and blossoms,
showing much of anthers, growing on the banks of the Itchen canal.</p>
<p>WINDFLOWER (<i>Anemone nemorosa</i>). - Smellfoxes, as the villagers&rsquo;
children inelegantly term this elegant flower, spreading its pearl-white
blossom, by means of its creeping root, all over the copses, and blushing
purple as the season advances.</p>
<p>WATER CROWFOOT (<i>Ranunculus aquatilis</i>). - The white flowers,
with yellow eyes, make quite a sheet over the ponds of Cranbury Common,
etc.&nbsp; Ivy-leaved (<i>R. hederaceus</i>). - Not so frequent.&nbsp;
The ivy-shaped leaves float above, the long fibrous ones go below.&nbsp;
When there is lack of moisture, leaves and flower are sometimes so small
that it has been supposed to be a different species.&nbsp; It was once
in a stagnant pond in Boyatt Lane, but is extinct again.</p>
<p>BUTTERCUP or CROWFOOT -<br />(<i>R. sceleratus</i>) Highly-polished
petals, which spangle<br />(<i>R. acris</i>) the fields and hedges with
gold.<br />(<i>R. repens</i>) All much alike; all haunting<br />(<i>R.
bulbosus</i>) kitchen-gardens and pastures, where the cattle, disliking
their taste, leave the stems standing up alone.</p>

narrow leaves.</p>
<p>GOLDILOCKS (<i>R. auricomus</i>). - More delicate, upper leaves spear-shaped,

treated as weeds.</p>
<p>YELLOW F. (<i>F. lutea</i>). - An old wall at Hursley.</p>
<p>CLIMBING F. (<i>Corydalis claviculata</i>). - Cuckoo bushes.&nbsp;
Standon, and in Hursley.</p>
<p>COLUMBINE (<i>Aquilegia vulgaris</i>). - This group of purple doves,
or of Turkish slippers, does not here merit the term <i>vulgaris</i>,
though, wherever it occurs, it is too far from a garden to be a stray.&nbsp;
Ampfield Wood, Lincoln&rsquo;s Copse, King&rsquo;s Lane, and Crabwood
have each furnished a specimen.</p>
<p>BARBERRY (<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>). - This handsome shrub of yellow
wood, delicate clusters of yellow flowers, and crimson fruit in long
oval bunches has been sedulously banished from an idea that it poisons
grass in its vicinity.&nbsp; There used to be a bush in Otterbourne
House grounds, but it has disappeared, and only one now remains in the
hedge of Pitt Downs.</p>
<p>POPPY (<i>Papaver Rh&aelig;as</i>). - Making neglected fields glorious
with a crimson mantle, visible for miles in the sun.</p>
<p>GREATER CELANDINE (<i>Chelidonium majus</i>). - Yellow flowers, very
frail, handsome pinnate leaf - lane at Brambridge, Standon, and in Hursley.</p>

but known by lanceolate leaves - cuckoo bushes.</p>
<p>PANSY (V. tricolor). - Everywhere in fallow fields.&nbsp; In rich
soil the upper petals become purple.</p>
<p>SUNDEW -</p>
<p>(<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i>) The curious, hairy, dewy leaves<br />(<i>D.
intermedia</i>) and flowers that never open in full day are to be found
in the marshes near Hiltingbury.</p>
<p>MILKWORT (<i>Polygala vulgaris</i>). - Small and blue on Otterbourne

out among leaves very like strawberry-leaves in the hedge.</p>
<p>TORMENTIL (<i>P. Tormentilla</i>). - This is now ranged among the

<p>SILVER-WEED or GOOSE-GRASS (<i>P. anserina</i>). - Why dedicated

<p>HOUSELEEK (<i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>). - Also called Sin-green,

beard, and in Germany is thought to preserve from thunder.</p>

<p>ELDER (<i>Sambucus nigra</i>). - In most hedges, though its honours

water, which village sages used to brew, and which was really an excellent
remedy for weak eyes.</p>

Sir Martin Wright is of opinion that Domesday-Book was made soon after
our ancestors had agreed to tenures, <i>i.e</i>. the feodal system of
tenure, for the purpose of ascertaining each man&rsquo;s fee; and he
supposes that as soon as the survey was completed, the great landholders
of the kingdom were summoned to London and Sarum to do homage to the
king for their landed possessions.&nbsp; Now it may be presumed, that
if Merdon had been then surrendered to the king, and any alteration
made in the nature of the tenure of the lands in the manor, it would
have been reported and registered in the book.&nbsp; But it certainly
is not to be found there.&nbsp; May it not then be justly concluded
that it was passed over, and that the customs now prevailing are the
same as were in use previous to the Conquest?</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
