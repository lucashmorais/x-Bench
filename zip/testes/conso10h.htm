<hr>

<p>It cannot be unknown to any that have travell'd into the
Dominions of the Czar of <i>Muscovy</i>, that this famous rising
Monarch, having studied all Methods for the Encrease of his Power,
and the Enriching as well as Polishing his Subjects, has travell'd
through most part of <i>Europe</i>, and visited the Courts of the
greatest Princes; from whence, by his own Observation, as well as
by carrying with him Artists in most useful Knowledge, he has
transmitted most of our General Practice, especially in War and
Trade, to his own Unpolite People; and the Effects of this
Curiosity of his are exceeding visible in his present Proceedings;
for by the Improvements he obtained in his <i>European</i> Travels,
he has Modell'd his Armies, form'd new Fleets, settled Foreign
Negoce in several remote Parts of the World; and we now see his
Forces besieging strong Towns, with regular Approaches; and his
Engineers raising Batteries, throwing Bombs, <i>&amp;c.</i> like
other Nations; whereas before, they had nothing of Order among
them, but carried all by <i>Ouslaught</i> and <i>Scalado</i>,
wherein they either prevailed by the Force of Irresistible
Multitude, or were Slaughter'd by heaps, and left the Ditches of
their Enemies fill'd with their Dead Bodies.</p>
<p>We see their Armies now form'd into regular Battalions; and
their <i>Strelitz Musqueteers</i>, a People equivalent to the
<i>Turks Janizaries</i>, cloath'd like our Guards, firing in
Platoons, and behaving themselves with extraordinary Bravery and
Order.</p>

<p>We see their Ships now compleatly fitted, built and furnish'd,
by the <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i> Artists, and their Men of
War Cruize in the <i>Baltick</i>. Their New City of
<i>Petersburgh</i> built by the present Czar, begins now to look
like our <i>Portsmouth</i>, fitted with Wet and Dry Docks,
Storehouses, and Magazines of Naval Preparations, vast and
Incredible; which may serve to remind us, how we once taught the
<i>French</i> to build Ships, till they are grown able to teach us
how to use them.</p>

<p>As to Trade, our large Fleets to <i>Arch-Angel</i> may speak for
it, where we now send 100 Sail yearly, instead of 8 or 9, which
were the greatest number we ever sent before; and the Importation
of Tobaccoes from <i>England</i> into his Dominions, would still
increase the Trade thither, was not the Covetousness of our own
Merchants the Obstruction of their Advantages. But all this by the
by.</p>

<p>As this great Monarch has Improved his Country, by introducing
the Manners and Customs of the Politer Nations of <i>Europe</i>;
so, with Indefatigable Industry, he has settled a new, but constant
Trade, between his Country and <i>China</i>, by Land; where his
Carravans go twice or thrice a Year, as Numerous almost, and as
strong, as those from <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Persia:</i> Nor is the Way
shorter, or the Desarts they pass over less wild and uninhabitable,
only that they are not so subject to Flouds of Sand, <i>if that
Term be proper</i>, or to Troops of <i>Arabs</i>, to destroy them
by the way; for this powerful Prince, to make this terrible Journey
feazible to his Subjects, has built Forts, planted Collonies and
Garisons at proper Distances; where, though they are seated in
Countries intirely Barren, and among uninhabited Rocks and Sands;
yet, by his continual furnishing them from his own Stores, the
Merchants travelling are reliev'd on good Terms, and meet both with
Convoy and Refreshment.</p>

<p>More might be said of the admirable Decorations of this Journey,
and how so prodigious an Attempt is made easy; so that now they
have an exact Correspondence, and drive a prodigious Trade between
<i>Muscow</i> and <i>Tonquin</i>; but having a longer Voyage in
Hand, I shall not detain the Reader, nor keep him till he grows too
big with Expectation.</p>

<p>Now, as all Men know the <i>Chineses</i> are an Ancient, Wise,
Polite, and most Ingenious People; so the <i>Muscovites</i> begun
to reap the Benefit of this open Trade; and not only to grow
exceeding Rich by the bartering for all the Wealth of those Eastern
Countries; but to polish and refine their Customs and Manners, as
much on that side as they have from their <i>European</i>
Improvements on this.</p>

<p>And as the <i>Chineses</i> have many sorts of Learning which
these Parts of the World never heard of, so all those useful
Inventions which we admire ourselves so much for, are vulgar and
common with them, and were in use long before our Parts of the
World were Inhabited. Thus <i>Gun-powder</i>, <i>Printing</i>, and
the use of the <i>Magnet</i> and <i>Compass</i>, which we call
Modern Inventions, are not only far from being Inventions, but fall
so far short of the Perfection of Art they have attained to, that
it is hardly Credible, what wonderful things we are told of from
thence, and all the Voyages the Author has made thither being
imploy'd another way, have not yet furnish'd him with the
Particulars fully enough to transmit them to view; not but that he
is preparing a Scheme of all those excellent Arts those Nations are
Masters of, for publick View, by way of Detection of the monstrous
Ignorance and Deficiencies of <i>European</i> Science; which may
serve as a <i>Lexicon Technicum</i> for this present Age, with
useful Diagrams for that purpose; wherein I shall not fail to
acqaint the World, 1. With the Art
of <i>Gunnery</i>, as Practis'd in <i>China</i> long before the War
of the <i>Giants</i>, and by which those Presumptuous Animals fired
Red-hot Bullets right up into Heaven, and made a Breach sufficient
to encourage them to a General Storm; but being Repulsed with great
Slaughter, they gave over the Siege for that time. This memorable
part of History shall be a faithful Abridgement of <i>Ibra
chizra-le-peglizar, Historiagrapher-Royal</i> to the Emperor of
<i>China</i>, who wrote <i>Anno Mundi</i> 114. his Volumes extant,
in the Publick Library at <i>Tonquin</i>, Printed in Leaves of
Vitrify'd Diamond, by an admirable Dexterity, struck all at an
oblique Motion, the Engine remaining intire, and still fit for use,
in the Chamber of the Emperor's Rarities.</p>

<p>And here I shall give you a Draft of the Engine it self, and a
Plan of its Operation, and the wonderful Dexterity of its
Performance.</p>

<p>If these Labours of mine shall prove successful, I may in my
next Journey that way, take an Abstract of their most admirable
Tracts in Navigation, and the Mysteries of <i>Chinese</i>
Mathematicks; which out-do all Modern Invention at that Rate, that
'tis Inconceivable: In this Elaborate Work I must run thro' the 365
Volumes of <i>Augro-machi-lanquaro-zi</i>, the most ancient
Mathematician in all <i>China</i>: From thence I shall give a
Description of a Fleet of Ships of 100000 Sail, built at the
Expence of the Emperor <i>Tangro</i> the 15th; who having Notice of
the General Deluge, prepar'd these Vessels, to every City and Town
in his Dominions One, and in Bulk proportion'd to the number of its
Inhabitants; into which Vessel all the People, with such Moveables
as they thought fit to save, and with 120 Days Provisions, were
receiv'd at the time of the Floud; and the rest of their Goods
being put into great Vessels made of <i>China</i> Ware, and fast
luted down on the top, were preserv'd unhurt by the Water: These
Ships they furnish'd with 600 Fathom of Chain instead of Cables;
which being fastned by wonderful Arts to the Earth, every Vessel
rid out the Deluge just at the Town's end; so that when the Waters
abated, the People had nothing to do, but to open the Doors made in
the Ship-sides, and come out, repair their Houses, open the great
<i>China</i> Pots their Goods were in, and so put themselves in
<i>Statu Quo</i>.</p>

<p>The Draft of one of these Ships I may perhaps obtain by my
Interest in the present Emperor's Court, as it has been preserv'd
ever since, and constantly repair'd, riding at Anchor in a great
Lake, about 100 Miles from <i>Tonquin</i>; in which all the People
of that City were preferv'd, amounting by their Computation to
about a Million and half.</p>

<p>And as these things must be very useful in these Parts, to abate
the Pride and Arrogance of our Modern Undertakers of great
Enterprizes, Authors of strange Foreign Accounts, Philosophical
Transactions, and the like; if Time and Opportunity permit, I may
let them know, how Infinitely we are out-done by those refined
Nations, in all manner of Mechanick Improvements and Arts; and in
discoursing of this, it will necessarily come in my way to speak of
a most Noble Invention, being an Engine I would recommend to all
People to whom <i>'tis necessary to have a good Memory</i>; and
which I design, if possible, to obtain a Draft of, that it may be
Erected in our Royal Societies Laboratory: It has the wonderfullest
Operations in the World: One part of it furnishes a Man of Business
to dispatch his Affairs strangely; for if he be a Merchant, he
shall write his Letters with one Hand, and Copy them with the
other; if he is posting his Books, he shall post the Debtor side
with one Hand, and the Creditor with the other; if he be a Lawyer,
he draws his Drafts with one Hand, and Ingrosses them with the
other.</p>

<p>Another part of it furnishes him with such an Expeditious way of
Writing, or Transcribing, that a Man cannot speak so fast, but he
that hears shall have it down in Writing before 'tis spoken; and a
Preacher shall deliver himself to his Auditory, and having this
Engine before him, shall put down every thing he says in Writing at
the same time; and so exactly is this Engine squar'd by Lines and
Rules, that it does not require him that Writes to keep his Eye
upon it.</p>

<p>I am told, in some Parts of <i>China</i>, they had arriv'd to
such a Perfection of Knowledge, as to understand one anothers
Thoughts; and that it was found to be an excellent Preservative to
humane Society, against all sorts of Frauds, Cheats, Sharping, and
many Thousand <i>European</i> Inventions of that Nature, <i>at
which only we can be said to out-do those Nations</i>.</p>

<p>I confess, I have not yet had leisure to travel those Parts,
having been diverted by an accidental Opportunity of a new Voyage I
had occasion to make for farther Discoveries, and which the
Pleasure and Usefulness thereof having been very great, I have
omitted the other for the present, but shall not fail to make a
Visit to those Parts the first Opportunity, and shall give my
Country-men the best Account I can of those things; for I doubt not
in Time to bring our Nation, so fam'd for improving other People's
Discoveries, to be as wise as any of those Heathen Nations; I wish
I had the same Prospect of making them half so honest.</p>

<p>I had spent but a few Months in this Country, but my search
after the Prodigy of humane Knowledge the People abounds with, led
me into Acquaintance with some of their principal Artists,
Engineers, and Men of Letters; and I was astonish'd at every Day's
Discovery of new and of unheard-of Worlds of Learning; but I
Improv'd in the Superficial Knowledge of their General, by no body
so much as by my Conversation with the Library-keeper of
<i>Tonquin</i>, by whom I had Admission into the vast Collection of
Books, which the Emperors of that Country have treasur'd up.</p>

<p>It would be endless to give you a Catalogue, and they admit of
no Strangers to write any thing down, but what the Memory can
retain, you are welcome to carry away with you; and amongst the
wonderful Volumes of Antient and Modern Learning, I could not but
take Notice of a few; which, besides those I mentioned before, I
saw, when I lookt over this vast Collection; and a larger Account
may be given in our next.</p>

<p>It would be needless to Transcribe the <i>Chinese</i> Character,
or to put their Alphabet into our Letters, because the Words would
be both Unintelligible, and very hard to Pronounce; and therefore,
to avoid hard Words, and Hyroglyphicks, I'll translate them as well
as I can.</p>

<p>The first Class I came to of Books, was the Constitutions of the
Empire; these are vast great Volumes, and have a sort of Engine
like our <i>Magna Charta</i>, to remove 'em, and with placing them
in a Frame, by turning a Screw, open'd the Leaves, and folded them
this way, or that, as the Reader desires. It was present Death for
the Library-keeper to refuse the meanest <i>Chinese</i> Subject to
come in and read them; for 'tis their Maxim, <i>That all People
ought to know the Laws by which they are to be govern'd</i>; and as
above all People, we find no Fools in this Country, so the
Emperors, though they seem to be Arbitrary, enjoy the greatest
Authority in the World, by always observing, with the greatest
Exactness, the <i>Pacta Conventa</i> of their Government: From
these Principles it is impossible we should ever hear, either of
the Tyranny of Princes, or Rebellion of Subjects, in all their
Histories.</p>

<p>At the Entrance into this Class, you find some Ancient Comments,
upon the Constitution of the Empire, written many Ages before we
pretend the World began; but above all, One I took particular
notice of, which might bear this Title, <i>Natural Right prov'd
Superior to Temporal Power</i>; wherein the old Author proves, the
<i>Chinese</i> Emperors were Originally made so, by Nature's
directing the People, to place the Power of Government in the most
worthy Person they could find; and the Author giving a most exact
History of 2000 Emperors, brings them into about 35 or 36 Periods
of Lines when the Race ended; and when a Collective Assembly of the
Nobles, Cities, and People, Nominated a new Family to the
Goverment.</p>

<p>This being an heretical Book as to <i>European</i> Politicks,
and our Learned Authors having long since exploded this Doctrine,
and prov'd that Kings and Emperors came down from Heaven with
Crowns on their Heads, and all their Subjects were born with
Saddles on their Backs; I thought fit to leave it where I found it,
least our excellent Tracts of Sir <i>Robert Filmer</i>, Dr.
<i>Hammond L...y</i>, <i>S....l</i>, and Others, who have so
learnedly treated of the more useful Doctrine of Passive Obedience,
Divine Right, <i>&amp;c.</i> should be blasphem'd by the Mob, grow
into Contempt of the People; and they should take upon them to
question their Superiors for the Blood of <i>Algernon Sidney</i>,
and <i>Argyle</i>.</p>

<p>For I take the Doctrines of Passive Obedience, <i>&amp;c.</i>
among the States-men, to be like the Copernican System of the
Earths Motion among Philosophers; which, though it be contrary to
all antient Knowledge, and not capable of Demonstration, yet is
adher'd to in general, because by this they can better solve, and
give a more rational Account of several dark Ph&aelig;nomena in
Nature, than they could before.</p>

<p>Thus our Modern States-men approve of this Scheme of Government;
not that it admits of any rational Defence, much less of
Demonstration, but because by this Method they can the better
explain, as well as defend, all Coertion in Cases invasive of
Natural Right, than they could before.</p>

<p>Here I found two famous Volumes in Chyrurgery, being an exact
Description of the Circulation of the Blood, discovered long before
King <i>Solomon</i>'s Allegory of the Bucket's going to the Well;
with several curious Methods by which the Demonstration was to be
made so plain, as would make even the worthy Doctor <i>B------</i>
himself become a Convert to his own Eye-sight, make him damn his
own Elaborate Book, and think it worse Nonsence than ever the Town
had the Freedom to imagine.</p>

<p>All our Philosophers are Fools, and their Transactions a parcel
of empty Stuff, to the Experiments of the Royal Societies in this
Country. Here I came to a Learned Tract of Winds, which outdoes
even the Sacred Text, and would make us believe it was not wrote to
those People; for they tell Folks whence it comes, and whither it
goes. There you have an Account how to make Glasses of Hogs Eyes,
that can see the Wind; and they give strange Accounts both of its
regular and irregular Motions, its Compositions and Quantities;
from whence, by a sort of Algebra, they can cast up its Duration,
Violence, and Extent: In these Calculations, some say, those
Authors have been so exact, that they can, as our Philosophers say
of Comets, state their Revolutions, and tell us how many Storms
there shall happen to any Period of time, and when; and perhaps
this may be with much about the same Truth.</p>

<p>It was a certain Sign <i>Aristotle</i> had never been at
<i>China</i>; for, had he seen the 216th Volume of the
<i>Chinese</i> Navigation, in the Library I am speaking of, a large
Book in Double Folio, wrote by the Famous
<i>Mira-cho-cho-lasmo</i>, Vice-Admiral of <i>China</i>, and said
to be printed there about 2000 Years before the Deluge, in the
Chapter of Tides he would have seen the Reason of all the certain
and uncertain Fluxes and Refluxes of that Element, how the exact
Pace is kept between the Moon and the Tides, with a most elaborate
Discourse there, of the Power of Sympathy, and the manner how the
heavenly Bodies Influence the Earthly: Had he seen this, the
<i>Stagyrite</i> would never have Drowned himself, because he could
not comprehend this Mystery.</p>

<p>'Tis farther related of this Famous Author, that he was no
Native of this World, but was Born in the <i>Moon</i>, and coming
hither to make Discoveries, by a strange Invention arrived to by
the <i>Virtuosoes</i> of that habitable World, the Emperor of
<i>China</i> prevailed with him to stay and improve his Subjects,
in the most exquisite Accomplishments of those <i>Lunar</i>
Regions; and no wonder the <i>Chinese</i> are such exquisite
Artists, and Masters of such sublime Knowledge, when this Famous
Author has blest them with such unaccountable Methods of
Improvement.</p>

<p>There was abundance of vast Classes full of the Works of this
wonderful Philosopher: He gave the <i>how</i>, the <i>modus</i> of
all the secret Operations of Nature; and told us, how Sensation is
convey'd to and from the Brain; why Respiration preserves Life; and
how Locomotion is directed to, as well as perform'd by the Parts.
There are some Anatomical Dissections of Thought, and a
Mathematical Description of Nature's strong Box, the Memory, with
all its Locks and Keys.</p>

<p>There you have that part of the Head turn'd in-side outward, in
which Nature has placed the Materials of reflecting; and like a
<i>Glass Bee-hive</i>, represents to you all the several Cells in
which are lodg'd things past, even back to Infancy and Conception.
There you have the Repository, with all its Cells, Classically,
Annually, Numerically, and Alphabetically Dispos'd. There you may
see how, when the perplext Animal, on the loss of a Thought or
Word, <i>scratches his Pole:</i> Every Attack of his Invading
Fingers knocks at Nature's Door, allarms all the Register-keepers,
and away they run, unlock all the Classes, search diligently for
what he calls for, and immediately deliver it up to the Brain; if
it cannot be found, they intreat a <i>little Patience</i>, till
they step into the <i>Revolvary</i>, where they run over little
Catalogues of the minutest Passages of Life, and so in time never
fail to hand on the thing; if not just when he calls for it, yet at
some other time.</p>

<p>And thus, when a thing lyes very Abstruse, and all the rumaging
of the whole House cannot find it; nay, when all the People in the
House have given it over, they very often find one thing when they
are looking for another.</p>

<p>Next you have the <i>Retentive</i> in the remotest part of the
Place, which, like the Records in the Tower, takes Possession of
all Matters, as they are removed from the Classes in the
Repository, for want of room. These are carefully Lockt, and kept
safe, never to be open'd but upon solemn Occasions, and have
swinging great Bars and Bolts upon them; so that what is kept here,
is seldom lost. Here <i>Conscience</i> has one large Ware-house,
and the <i>Devil</i> another; the first is very seldom open'd, but
has a Chink or Till, where all the Follies and Crimes of Life being
minuted are dropt in; but as the Man seldom cares to look in, the
Locks are very Rusty, and not open'd but with great Difficulty, and
on extraordinary Occasions, as Sickness, Afflictions, Jails,
Casualties, and Death; and then the Bars all give way at once; and
being prest from within with a more than ordinary Weight, burst as
a Cask of Wine upon the Fret, which for want of Vent, makes all the
Hoops fly.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Devil</i>'s Ware-house, he has two constant
Warehouse-keepers, <i>Pride</i> and <i>Conceit</i>, and these are
always at the Door, showing their Wares, and exposing the pretended
Vertues and Accomplishments of the Man, by way of Ostentation.</p>

<p>In the middle of this curious part of Nature, there is a clear
Thorough-fare, representing the World, through which so many
Thousand People pass so easily, and do so little worth taking
notice of, that 'tis for no manner of Signification to leave Word
they have been here. Thro' this <i>Opening</i> pass Millions of
things not worth remembring, and which the Register-Keepers, who
stand at the Doors of the Classes, as they go by, take no notice
of; such as Friendships, helps in Distress, Kindnesses in
Affliction, Voluntary Services, and all sorts of Importunate Merit;
things which being but Trifles in their own Nature, are made to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>In another Angle is to be seen the <i>Memory's Garden</i>, in
which her most pleasant things are not only Deposited, but Planted,
Transplanted, Grafted, Inoculated, and obtain all possible
Propagation and Encrease; these are the most pleasant, delightful,
and agreeable things, call'd Envy, Slander, Revenge, Strife and
Malice, with the Additions of Ill-turns, Reproaches, and all manner
of Wrong; these are caressed in the Cabinet of the <i>Memory</i>,
with a World of Pleasure never let pass, and carefully Cultivated
with all imaginable Art.</p>

<p>There are multitudes of Weeds, Toys, Chat, Story, Fiction, and
Lying, which in the great throng of passant Affairs, stop by the
way, and crowding up the Place, leave no room for their Betters
that come behind, which makes many a good Guess be put by, and left
to go clear thro' for want of Entertainment.</p>

<p>There are a multitude of things very curious and observable,
concerning this little, but very accurate thing, called
<i>Memory</i>; but above all, I see nothing so very curious, as the
wonderful Art of <i>Wilful Forgetfulness</i>; and as 'tis a thing,
indeed, I never could find any Person compleatly Master of, it
pleased me very much, to find this Author has made a large Essay,
to prove there is really no such Power in Nature; and that the
Pretenders to it are all Impostors, and put a Banter upon the
World; for that it is impossible for any Man to oblige himself to
forget a thing, since he that can remember to forget, and at the
same time forget to remember, has an Art above the Devil.</p>

<p>In his Laboratory you see <i>a Fancy</i> preserv'd <i>a la
Mummy</i>, several Thousand Years old; by examining which you may
perfectly discern, how Nature makes a Poet: Another you have taken
from a meer Natural, which discovers the Reasons of Nature's
Negative in the Case of humane Understanding; what Deprivation of
Parts She suffers, in the Composition of a Coxcomb; and with what
wonderful Art She prepares a Man to be a Fool.</p>

<p>Here being the product of this Author's wonderful Skill, you
have the <i>Skeleton of a Wit</i>, with all the Readings of
Philosophy and Chyrurgery upon the Parts: Here you see all the
Lines Nature has drawn to form <i>a Genius</i>, how it performs,
and from what Principles.</p>

<p>Also you are Instructed to know the true reason of the Affinity
between Poetry and Poverty; and that it is equally derived from
what's Natural and Intrinsick, as from Accident and Circumstance;
how the World being always full of Fools and Knaves, Wit is sure to
miss of a good Market; especially, if Wit and Truth happen to come
in Company; for the Fools don't understand it, and the Knaves can't
bear it.</p>

<p>But still 'tis own'd, and is most apparent, there is something
also Natural in the Case too, since there are some particular
Vessels Nature thinks necessary, to the more exact Composition of
this nice thing call'd <i>a Wit</i>, which as they are, or are not
Interrupted in the peculiar Offices for which they are appointed,
are subject to various Distempers, and more particularly to
Effluxions and Vapour, <i>Diliriums</i> Giddiness of the Brain, and
<i>Laps&aelig;</i>, or <i>Looseness of the Tongue</i>; and as these
Distempers, occasion'd by the exceeding quantity of Volatiles,
Nature is obliged to make use of in the Composition, are hardly to
be avoided, the Disasters which generally they push the Animal
into, are as necessarily consequent to them as Night is to the
Setting of the <i>Sun</i>; and these are very many, as disobliging
Parents, who have frequently in this Country whipt their
<i>Sons</i> for making Verses; and here I could not but reflect how
useful a Discipline early Correction must be to a Poet; and how
easy the Town had been had <i>N---t</i>, <i>E---w</i>, <i>T. B---
P---s</i>, <i>D-- S-- D---fy</i>, and an Hundred more of the
jingling Train of our modern Rhymers, been Whipt young, <i>very
young</i>, for Poetasting, they had never perhaps suckt in that
Venome of Ribaldry, which all the Satyr of the Age has never been
able to scourge out of them to this Day.</p>

<p>The further fatal Consequences of these unhappy Defects in
Nature, where she has damn'd a Man to Wit and Rhyme, has been loss
of Inheritance, Parents being aggravated by the obstinate young
<i>Beaus</i>, resolving to be Wits in spight of Nature, the wiser
Head has been obliged to Confederate with Nature, and with-hold the
Birth-right of Brains, which otherwise the young Gentleman might
have enjoy'd, to the great support of his Family and Posterity.
Thus the famous <i>Waller</i>, <i>Denham</i>, <i>Dryden</i>, and
sundry Others, were oblig'd to condemn their Race to Lunacy and
Blockheadism, only to prevent the fatal Destruction of their
Families, and entailing the Plague of Wit and Weathercocks upon
their Posterity.</p>

<p>The yet farther Extravagancies which naturally attend the
Mischief of <i>Wit</i>, are <i>Beau-ism</i>, <i>Dogmaticality</i>,
<i>Whimsification</i>, <i>Impudensity</i>, and various kinds of
<i>Fopperosities</i> (according to Mr. <i>Boyl</i>,) which issuing
out of the Brain, descend into all the Faculties, and branch
themselves by infinite Variety, into all the Actions of Life.</p>

<p>These by Conseqence, Beggar the Head, the Tail, the Purse, and
the whole Man, till he becomes as poor and despicable as Negative
Nature can leave him, abandon'd of his Sense, his Manners, his
Modesty, and what's worse, his Money, having nothing left but his
Poetry, dies in a Ditch, or a Garret, <i>A-la-mode de Tom
Brown</i>, uttering Rhymes and Nonsence to the last Moment.</p>

<p>In Pity to all my unhappy Brethren, who suffer under these
Inconveniencies, I cannot but leave it on Record, that they may not
be reproached with being Agents of their own Misfortunes, since I
assure them, Nature has form'd them with the very Necessity of
acting like Coxcombs, fixt upon them by the force of Organick
Consequences, and placed down at the very Original Effusion of that
fatal thing call'd <i>Wit</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is the Discovery less wonderful than edifying, and no humane
Art on our side the World ever found out such a Sympathetick
Influence, between the Extreams of <i>Wit</i> and <i>Folly</i>,
till this great Lunarian Naturalist furnisht us with such
unheard-of Demonstrations.</p>

<p>Nor is this all I learnt from him, tho' I cannot part with this,
till I have publisht a <i>Memento Mori</i>, and told 'em what I had
discovered of Nature in these remote Parts of the World, from
whence I take the Freedom to tell these Gentlemen, That if they
please to Travel to these distant Parts, and examine this great
Master of Nature's Secrets, they may every Man see what cross
Strokes Nature has struck, to finish and form every extravagant
Species of that Heterogenious Kind we call <i>Wit</i>.</p>

<p>There <i>C--- S---</i> may be inform'd how he comes to be very
Witty, and a Mad-man all at once; and <i>P---r</i> may see, That
with less Brains and more <i>P--x</i> he is more a Wit and more a
Mad-man than the Coll. <i>Ad---son</i> may tell his Master my Lord
<i>----</i> the reason from Nature, why he would not take the
Court's Word, nor write the Poem call'd, <i>The Campaign</i>, till
he had 200 <i>l. per Annum</i> secur'd to him; since 'tis known
they have but one Author in the Nation that writes for 'em for
nothing, and he is labouring very hard to obtain the Title of
Blockhead, and not be paid for it: Here <i>D.</i> might understand,
how he came to be able to banter all Mankind, and yet all Mankind
be able to banter him; at the fame time our numerous throng of
<i>Parnassians</i> may see Reasons for the variety of the Negative
and Positive Blessings they enjoy; some for having Wit and no
Verse, some Verse and no Wit, some Mirth without Jest, some Jest
without Fore-cast, some Rhyme and no Jingle, some all Jingle and no
Rhyme, some Language without measure; some all Quantity and no
Cudence, some all Wit and no Sence, some all Sence and no Flame,
some Preach in Rhyme, some sing when they Preach, some all Song and
no Tune, some all Tune and no Song; all these Unaccountables have
their Originals, and can be answer'd for in unerring Nature, tho'
in our out-side Guesses we can say little to it. Here is to be
seen, why some are all Nature, some all Art; some beat Verse out of
the Twenty-four rough Letters, with Ten Hammers and Anvils to every
Line, and maul the Language as a <i>Swede</i> beats Stock-Fish;
Others <i>buff</i> Nature, and bully her out of whole Stanza's of
ready-made Lines at a time, carry all before them, and rumble like
distant Thunder in a black Cloud: Thus Degrees and Capacities are
fitted by Nature, according to Organick Efficacy; and the Reason
and Nature of Things are found in themselves: Had <i>D---y</i> seen
his own Draft by this Light of <i>Chinese</i> Knowledge, he might
have known he should be a Coxcomb without writing Twenty-two Plays,
to stand as so many Records against him. <i>Dryden</i> might have
told his Fate, that having his extraordinary Genius flung and
pitcht upon a Swivle, it would certainly turn round as fast as the
Times, and instruct him how to write Elegies to <i>O. C.</i> and
King <i>C.</i> the Second, with all the Coherence imaginable; how
to write <i>Religio Laicy</i>, and the <i>Hind</i> and
<i>Panther</i>, and yet be the same Man, every Day to change his
Principle, change his Religion, change his Coat, change his Master,
and yet never change his Nature.</p>

<p>There are abundance of other Secrets in Nature discover'd in
relation to these things, too many to repeat, and yet too useful to
omit, as the reason why Phisicians are generally Atheists; and why
Atheists are universally Fools, and generally live to know it
themselves, the real Obstructions, which prevent fools being mad,
all the Natural Causes of Love, abundance of Demonstrations of the
Synonimous Nature of Love and Leachery, especially consider'd <i>a
la Modern</i>, with an absolute Specifick for the Frenzy of Love,
found out in the Constitution, Anglice, <i>a Halter</i>.</p>

<p>It would be endless to reckon up the numerous Improvements, and
wonderful Discoveries this extraordinary Person has brought down,
and which are to be seen in his curious Chamber of Rarities.</p>

<p>Particularly, a Map of <i>Parnassus</i>, with an exact
Delineation of all the Cells, Apartments, Palaces and Dungeons, of
that most famous Mountain; with a Description of its Heighth, and a
learned Dissertation, proving it to be the properest Place next to
the P---e House to take a Rise at, for a flight to the World in the
<i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>Also some Enquiries, whether <i>Noah</i>'s Ark did not first
rest upon it; and this might be one of the Summits of
<i>Ararat</i>, with some Confutations of the gross and palpable
Errors, which place this extraordinary Skill among the Mountains of
the <i>Moon</i> in <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<p>Also you have here <i>a Muse calcin'd</i>, a little of the
Powder of which given to a Woman big with Child, if it be a Boy it
will be a Poet, if a Girl she'll be a Whore, if an Hermaphrodite it
will be Lunatick.</p>

<p>Strange things, they tell us, have been done with this calcin'd
Womb of Imagination; if the Body it came from was a Lyrick Poet,
the Child will be a Beau, or a Beauty; if an Heroick Poet, he will
be a Bulley; if his Talent was Satyr, he'll be a Philosopher.</p>

<p>Another Muse they tell us, they have dissolv'd into a Liquid,
and kept with wondrous Art, the Vertues of which are Soveraign
against Ideotism, Dullness, and all sorts of Lethargick Diseases;
but if given in too great a quantity, creates Poesy, Poverty,
Lunacy, and the Devil in the Head ever after.</p>

<p>I confess, I always thought these Muses strange intoxicating
things, and have heard much talk of their Original, but never was
acquainted with their Vertue <i>a la Simple</i> before; however, I
would always advise People against too large a Dose of Wit, and
think the Physician must be a Mad-man that will venture to
prescribe it.</p>

<p>As all these noble Acquirements came down with this wonderful
Man from the World in the <i>Moon</i>, it furnisht me with these
useful Observations.</p>

<p>1. That Country must needs be a Place of strange Perfection, in
all parts of extraordinary Knowledge.</p>

<p>2. How useful a thing it would be for most sorts of our People,
especially Statesmen, P----t-men, Convocation-men, Phylosophers,
Physicians, Quacks, Mountebanks, Stock-jobbers, and all the Mob of
the Nation's Civil or Ecclesiastical <i>Bone-setters</i>, together
with some Men of the Law, some of the Sword, and all of the Pen: I
say, how useful and improving a thing it must be to them, to take a
Journey up to the World in the <i>Moon</i>; but above all, how much
more beneficial it would be to them that stay'd behind.</p>

<p>3. That it is not to be wonder'd at, why the <i>Chinese</i>
excell so much all these Parts of the World, since but for that
Knowledge which comes down to them from the World in the
<i>Moon</i>, they would be like other People.</p>

<p>4. No Man need to Wonder at my exceeding desire to go up to the
World in the <i>Moon</i>, having heard of such extraordinary
Knowledge to be obtained there, since in the search of Knowledge
and Truth, wiser Men than I have taken as unwarrantable Flights,
and gone a great deal higher than the <i>Moon</i>, into a strange
Abbyss of dark <i>Ph&aelig;nomena</i>, which they neither could
make other People understand, nor ever rightly understood
themselves, witness <i>Malbranch</i>, Mr. <i>Lock</i>,
<i>Hobbs</i>, the Honourable <i>Boyle</i> and a great many others,
besides Messieurs <i>Norris</i>, <i>Asgil</i>, <i>Coward</i>, and
the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>.</p>

<p>This great Searcher into Nature has, besides all this, left
wonderful Discoveries and Experiments behind him; but I was with
nothing more exceedingly diverted, than with his various Engines,
and curious Contrivances, to go to and from his own Native Country
the <i>Moon</i>. All our Mechanick Motions of Bishop
<i>Wilkins</i>, or the artificial Wings of the Learned
<i>Spaniard</i>, who could have taught God Almighty how to have
mended the Creation, are Fools to this Gentleman; and because no
Man in <i>China</i> has made more Voyages up into the <i>Moon</i>
than my self, I cannot but give you some Account of the easyness of
the Passage, as well as of the Country.</p>

<p>Nor are his wonderful Tellescopes of a mean Quality, by which
such plain Discoveries are made, of the Lands and Seas in the
<i>Moon</i>, and in all the habitable Planets, that one may as
plainly fee what a Clock it is by one of the Dials in the
<i>Moon</i>, as if it were no farther off than
<i>Windsor-Castle</i>; and had he liv'd to finish the
Speaking-trumpet which he had contriv'd to convey Sound thither,
<i>Harlequin's Mock-Trumpet</i> had been a Fool to it; and it had
no doubt been an admirable Experiment, to have given us a general
Advantage from all their acquir'd Knowledge in those Regions, where
no doubt several useful Discoveries are daily made by the Men of
Thought for the Improvement of all sorts of humane Understanding,
and to have discoursed with them on those things, must have been
very pleasant, besides, its being very much to our particular
Advantage.</p>

<p>I confess, I have thought it might have been very useful to this
Nation, to have brought so wonderful an Invention hither, and I was
once very desirous to have set up my rest here, and for the Benefit
of my Native Country, have made my self Master of these Engines,
that I might in due time have convey'd them to our Royal Society,
that once in 40 Years they might have been said to do something for
Publick Good; and that the Reputation and Usefulness of the <i>so
so's</i> might be recover'd in <i>England</i>; but being told that
in the Moon there were many of these Glasses to be had very cheap,
and I having declar'd my Resolution of undertaking a Voyage
thither, I deferred my Design, and shall defer my treating of them,
till I give some Account of my Arrival there.</p>

<p>But above all his Inventions for making this Voyage, I saw none
more pleasant or profitable, than a certain Engine formed in the
shape of a Chariot, on the Backs of two vast Bodies with extended
Wings, which spread about 50 Yards in Breadth, compos'd of Feathers
so nicely put together, that no Air could pass; and as the Bodies
were made of <i>Lunar Earth</i> which would bear the Fire, the
Cavities were fill'd with an Ambient Flame, which fed on a certain
Spirit deposited in a proper quantity, to last out the Voyage; and
this Fire so order'd as to move about such Springs and Wheels as
kept the Wings in a most exact and regular Motion, always
ascendant; thus the Person being placed in this airy Chariot,
drinks a certain dozing Draught, that throws him into a gentle
Slumber, and Dreaming all the way, never wakes till he comes to his
Journey's end.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Of the</i> Consolidator.</p>

<p>These Engines are call'd in their Country Language,
<i>Dupekasses</i>; and according to the Ancient <i>Chinese</i>, or
<i>Tartarian</i>, <i>Apezolanthukanistes</i>; in <i>English</i>, a
<i>Consolidator</i>.</p>

<p>The Composition of this Engine is very admirable; for, as is
before noted, 'tis all made up of Feathers, and the quality of the
Feathers, is no less wonderful than their Composition; and
therefore, I hope the Reader will bear with the Description for the
sake of the Novelty, since I assure him such things as these are
not to be seen in every Country.</p>

<p>The number of Feathers are just 513, they are all of a length
and breadth exactly, which is absolutely necessary to the
<i>floating Figure</i>, or else one side or any one part being
wider or longer than the rest, it would interrupt the motion of the
whole Engine; only there is one extraordinary Feather which, as
there is an odd one in the number, is placed in the Center, and is
the Handle, or rather Rudder to the whole Machine: This Feather is
every way larger than its Fellows, 'tis almost as long and broad
again; but above all, its Quill or Head is much larger, and it has
<i>as it were</i> several small bushing Feathers round the bottom
of it, which all make but one presiding or superintendent Feather,
to guide, regulate, and pilot the whole Body.</p>

<p>Nor are these common Feathers, but they are pickt and cull'd out
of all parts of the Lunar Country, by the Command of the Prince;
and every Province sends up the best they can find, <i>or ought to
do so at least</i>, or else they are very much to blame; for the
Employment they are put to being of so great use to the Publick,
and the Voyage or Flight so exceeding high, it would be very ill
done if, when the King sends his Letters about the Nation, to pick
him up the best Feathers they can lay their Hands on, they should
send weak, decay'd, or half-grown Feathers, and yet sometimes it
happens so; and once there was such rotten Feathers collected,
whether it was a bad Year for Feathers, or whether the People that
gather'd them had a mind to abuse their King; but the Feathers were
so bad, the Engine was good for nothing, but broke before it was
got half way; and by a double Misfortune, this happen'd to be at an
unlucky time, when the King himself had resolv'd on a Voyage, or
Flight to to the <i>Moon</i>; but being deceiv'd, by the unhappy
Miscarriage of the deficient Feathers, he fell down from so great a
height, that he struck himself against his own Palace, and beat his
Head off.</p>

<p>Nor had the Sons of this Prince much better Success, tho' the
first of them was a Prince mightily belov'd by his Subjects; but
his Misfortunes chiefly proceeded from his having made use of one
of the Engines so very long, that the Feathers were quite worn out,
and good for nothing: He used to make a great many Voyages and
Flights into the <i>Moon</i>, and then would make his Subjects give
him great Sums of Money to come down to them again; and yet they
were so fond of him, That they always complyed with him, and would
give him every thing he askt, rather than to be without him: <i>But
they grew wiser since</i>.</p>

<p>At last, this Prince used his Engine so long, it could hold
together no longer; and being obliged to write to his Subjects to
pick him out some new Feathers, <i>they did so</i>; but withall
sent him such <i>strong</i> Feathers, and so <i>stiff</i>, that
when he had placed 'em in their proper places, and made a very
beautiful Engine, it was <i>too heavy for him to manage:</i> He
made a great many Essays at it, and had it placed on the top of an
old Idol Chappel, dedicated to an old <i>Bramyn</i> Saint of those
Countries, called, <i>Phantosteinaschap</i>; in <i>Latin</i>,
<i>chap. de Saint Stephano</i>; or in <i>English</i>, St.
<i>Stephen</i>'s: Here the Prince try'd all possible Contrivances,
and a vast deal of Money it cost him; but the Feathers were <i>so
stiff</i> they would not work, and <i>the Fire within</i> was so
choaked and smother'd with its <i>own Smoak</i>, for want of due
Vent and Circulation, that it <i>would not burn</i>; so he was
oblig'd to take it down again; and from thence he carried it to his
College of <i>Bramyn</i> Priests, and set it up in one of their
Publick Buildings: There he drew Circles of Ethicks and Politicks,
and fell to casting of Figures and Conjuring, but all would not do,
<i>the Feathers</i> could not be brought to move; and, indeed, I
have observ'd, That these Engines are seldom helpt by Art and
Contrivance; there is no way with them, but to have the People
spoke to, to get <i>good Feathers</i>; and they are easily placed,
and perform all the several Motions with the greatest Ease and
Accuracy imaginable; <i>but it must be all Nature</i>; any thing of
Force distorts and dislocates them, and the whole Order is spoiled;
and if there be but one Feather out of place, or pincht, or stands
wrong, <i>the D---l would not ride in the Chariot</i>.</p>

<p>The Prince thus finding his Labour in vain, broke the Engine to
pieces, and sent his Subjects Word what bad Feathers they had sent
him: But the People, who knew it was his own want of Management,
and that the Feathers were good enough, only a little stiff at
first, and with good Usage would have been brought to be fit for
use, took it ill, and never would send him any other as long as he
liv'd: However, it had this good effect upon him, That he never
made any more Voyages to the <i>Moon</i> as long as he reign'd.</p>

<p>His Brother succeeded him; and truly he was resolved upon a
Voyage to the <i>Moon</i>, as soon as ever he came to the Crown. He
had met with some unkind Usage from the Religious <i>Lunesses</i>
of his own Country; and he turn'd <i>Abogratziarian</i>, a zealous
fiery Sect something like our <i>Anti-every-body-arians</i> in
<i>England</i>. 'Tis confest, some of the <i>Bramyns</i> of his
Country were very false to him, put him upon several Ways of
extending his Power over his Subjects, contrary to the Customs of
the People, and contrary to his own Interest; and when the People
expressed their Dislike of it, he thought to have been supported by
those Clergy-men; but they failed him, and made good, that Old
<i>English</i> Verse;</p>

<p><i>That Priests of all Religions are the same</i>.</p>

<p>He took this so hainously, that he conceiv'd a just Hatred
against those that had deceiv'd him; and as Resentments seldom keep
Rules, unhappily entertain'd Prejudices against all the rest; and
not finding it easy to bring all his Designs to pass better, he
resolved upon a Voyage to the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he sends a Summons to all his People according to
Custom, to collect the usual quantity of Feathers for that purpose;
and because he would be sure not be used as his Brother and Father
had been, he took care to send certain Cunning-men Express, all
over the Country, to bespeak the People's Care, in collecting,
picking and culling them out, these were call'd in their Language,
<i>Tsopablesdetoo</i>; which being Translated may signify in
<i>English</i>, <i>Men of Zeal</i>, or <i>Booted Apostles</i>: Nor
was this the only Caution this Prince used; for he took care, as
the Feathers were sent up to him, to search and examine them one by
one in his own Closet, to see if they were fit for his purpose;
but, alas! he found himself in his Brother's Case exactly; and
perceived, That his Subjects were generally disgusted at his former
Conduct, about <i>Abrogratzianism</i>, and such things, and
particularly set in a Flame by some of their Priests, call'd,
<i>Dullobardians</i>, or <i>Passive-Obedience-men</i>, who had
lately turn'd their Tale, and their Tail too upon their own
Princes; and upon this, he laid aside any more Thoughts of the
Engine, but took up a desperate and implacable Resolution,
<i>viz.</i> to fly up to the Moon without it; in order to this,
abundance of his Cunning-men were summon'd together to assist him,
strange Engines contriv'd, and Methods propos'd; and a great many
came from all Parts, to furnish him with Inventions and equivalent
for their Journey; but all were so preposterous and ridiculous,
that his Subjects seeing him going on to ruin himself, and by
Consequence them too, unanimously took Arms; and if their Prince
had not made his Escape into a foreign Country, 'tis thought they
would have secur'd him <i>for a Mad-man</i>.</p>

<p>And here 'tis observable, That as it is in most such Cases, the
mad Councellors of this Prince, when the People begun to gather
about him, fled; and every one shifted for themselves; nay, and
some of them plunder'd him first of his Jewels and Treasure, and
never were heard of since.</p>

<p>From this Prince none of the Kings or Government of that Country
have ever seem'd to incline to the hazardous Attempt of the Voyage
to the <i>Moon</i>, at least not in such a hair-brain'd manner.</p>

<p>However, the Engine has been very accurately Re-built and
finish'd; and the People are now oblig'd by a Law, to send up new
Feathers every three Years, to prevent the Mischiefs which happen'd
by that Prince aforesaid, keeping one Set so long that it was
dangerous to venture with them; and thus the Engine is preserved
fit for use.</p>

<p>And yet has not this Engine been without its continual
Disasters, and often out of repair; for though the Kings of the
Country, as has been Noted, have done riding on the back of it, yet
the <i>restless</i> Courtiers and Ministers of State have
frequently obtained the Management of it, from the too easy
Goodness of their Masters, or the Evils of the Times.</p>

<p>To Cure this, the Princes frequently chang'd Hands, turn'd one
Set of Men out and put another in: But this made things still
worse; for it divided the People into Parties and Factions in the
State, and still the Strife was, who should ride in this Engine;
and no sooner were these <i>Skaet-Riders</i> got into it, but they
were for <i>driving all the Nation up to the Moon</i>: But of this
by it self.</p>

<p>Authors differ concerning the Original of these Feathers, and by
what most exact Hand they were first appointed to this particular
use; and as their Original is hard to be found, so it seems a
Difficulty to resolve from what sort of Bird these Feathers are
obtained: Some have nam'd one, some another; but the most Learned
in those Climates call it by a hard Word, which the Printer having
no Letters to express, and being in that place Hierogliphical, I
can translate no better, than by the Name of a <i>Collective:</i>
This must be a Strange Bird without doubt; it has Heads, Claws,
Eyes and Teeth innumerable; and if I should go about to describe it
to you, the History would be so Romantick, it would spoil the
Credit of these more Authentick Relations which are yet behind.</p>

<p>'Tis sufficient, therefore, for the present, only to leave you
this short Abridgement of the Story, as follows: This great
Monstrous Bird, call'd the <i>Collective</i>, is very seldom seen,
and indeed never, but upon <i>Great Revolutions</i>, and portending
terrible Desolations and Destructions to a Country.</p>

<p>But he frequently sheds his Feathers; and they are carefully
pickt up, by the <i>Proprietors</i> of those Lands where they fall;
for <i>none but those Proprietors may</i> meddle with them; and
they no sooner pick them up but they are sent to Court, where they
obtain a new Name, and are called in a Word equally difficult to
pronounce as the other, but Very like our <i>English</i> Word,
<i>Representative</i>; and being placed in their proper Rows, with
the <i>Great Feather</i> in the Center, and fitted for use, they
lately obtained the Venerable Title of, <i>The Consolidators</i>;
and the Machine it self, the <i>Consolidator</i>; and by that Name
the Reader is desir'd for the future to let it be dignified and
distinguish'd.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, forbear to descant a little here, on the
Dignity and Beauty of these Feathers, being such as are hardly to
be seen in any part of the World, but just in these remote
Climates.</p>

<p>And First, Every Feather has various Colours, and according to
the Variety of the Weather, are apt to look brighter and clearer,
or paler and fainter, as the <i>Sun</i> happens to look on them
with a stronger or weaker Aspect. The Quill or Head of every
Feather is <i>or ought to be</i> full of a vigorous Substance,
which gives Spirit, and supports the brightness and colour of the
Feather; and as this is more or less in quantity, the bright Colour
of the Feather is increased, or turns languid and pale.</p>

<p>Tis true, some of those Quills are exceeding empty and dry; and
the Humid being totally exhal'd, those Feathers grow very useless
and insignificant in a short time.</p>

<p>Some again are so full of Wind, and puft up with the Vapour of
the Climate, that there's not Humid enough to Condence the Steam;
and these are so fleet, so light, and so continually fluttering and
troublesome, that they greatly serve to disturb and keep the Motion
unsteddy.</p>

<p>Others either placed too near the inward concealed Fire, or the
Head of the Quill being thin, the Fire causes too great a
Fermentation; and the Consequence of this is so fatal, that
sometimes it mounts the Engine up too fast, and indangers
Precipitation: But 'tis happily observed, That these ill Feathers
are but a very few, compar'd to the whole number; at the most, I
never heard they were above 134 of the whole number: As for the
empty ones, they are not very dangerous, but a sort of
<i>Good-for-nothing Feathers</i>, that will fly when the greatest
number of the rest fly, or stand still when they stand still. The
fluttering hot-headed Feathers are the most dangerous, and
frequently struggle hard to mount the Engine to extravagant
heights; but still the greater number of the Feathers being stanch,
and well fixt, as well as well furnisht, they always prevail, and
check the Disorders the other would bring upon the Motion; so that
upon the whole Matter, tho' there has sometims been oblique
Motions, Variations, and sometimes great Wandrings out of the way,
which may make the Passage tedious, yet it has always been a
certain and safe Voyage; and no Engine was ever known to miscarry
or overthrow, but that one mentioned before, and that was very much
owing to the precipitate Methods the Prince took in guiding it; and
tho' all the fault was laid in the Feathers, <i>and they were to
blame enough</i>, yet I never heard any Wise Man, but what blam'd
his Discretion, and particularly, a certain great Man has wrote
three large Tracts of those Affairs, and call'd them, <i>The
History of the Opposition of the Feathers</i>; wherein, tho' it was
expected he would have curst the Engine it self and all the
Feathers to the Devil, on the contrary, he lays equal blame on the
Prince, who guided the Chariot with so unsteddy a hand, now as much
too slack, as then too hard, turning them this way and that so
hastily, that the Feathers could not move in their proper order;
and this at last put the Fire in the Center quite out, and so the
Engine over-set at once. This Impartiality has done great Justice
to the Feathers, and set things in a clearer light: But of this I
shall say more, when I come to treat of the <i>Works of the
Learned</i> in this Lunar World.</p>

<p>This is hinted here only to inform the Reader, That this Engine
is the safest Passage that ever was found out; and that saving that
one time, it never miscarried; nor if the common Order of things be
observed, cannot Miscarry; for the good Feathers are always
<i>Negatives</i>, when any precipitant Motion is felt, and
immediately suppress it by their number; and these <i>Negative
Feathers</i> are indeed the Travellers safety; the other are always
upon the flutter, and upon every occasion <i>hey for the Moon</i>,
up in the Clouds presently; but these <i>Negative Feathers</i> are
never for going up, but when there is occasion for it; and from
hence these fluttering fermented Feathers were called by the
Antients <i>High-flying Feathers</i>, and the blustering things
seem'd proud of the Name.</p>

<p>But to come to their general Character, the Feathers, speaking
of them all together, are generally very Comely, Strong, Large,
Beautiful things, their Quills or Heads well fixt, and the Cavities
fill'd with a solid substantial Matter, which tho' it is full of
Spirit, has a great deal of Temperament, and full of suitable
well-dispos'd Powers, to the Operation for which they are
design'd.</p>

<p>These placed, as I Noted before, in an extended Form like two
great Wings, and operated by that sublime Flame; which being
concealed in proper Receptacles, obtains its vent at the Cavities
appointed, are supplied from thence with Life and Motion; and as
Fire it fell, in the Opinion of some Learned Men, is nothing but
Motion, and Motion tends to Fire: It can no more be a Wonder, if
exalted in the Center of this famous Engine, a whole Nation should
be carried up to the World in the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis true, this Engine is frequently assaulted with fierce
Winds, and furious Storms, which sometimes drive it a great way out
of its way; and indeed, considering the length of the Passage, and
the various Regions it goes through, it would be strange if it
should meet with no Obstructions: These are oblique Gales, and
cannot be said to blow from any of the Thirty-two Points, but
Retrograde and Thwart: Some of these are call'd in their Language,
<i>Pensionazima</i>, which is as much as to say, being Interpreted,
a <i>Court-breeze</i>; another sort of Wind, which generally blows
directly contrary to the <i>Pensionazima</i>, is the
<i>Clamorio</i>, or in <i>English</i>, a <i>Country Gale</i>; this
is generally Tempestuous, full of Gusts and Disgusts, Squauls and
sudden Blasts, not without claps of Thunder, and not a little
flashing of Heat and Party-fires.</p>

<p>There are a great many other Internal Blasts, which proceed from
the Fire within, which sometimes not circulating right, breaks out
in little Gusts of Wind and Heat, and is apt to indanger setting
Fire to the Feathers, and this is more or less dangerous, according
as among which of the Feathers it happens; for some of the Feathers
are more apt to take Fire than others, as their Quills or Heads are
more or less full of that solid Matter mention'd before.</p>

<p>The Engine suffers frequent Convulsions and Disorders from these
several Winds; and which if they chance to overblow very much,
hinder the Passage; but the Negative Feathers always apply Temper
and Moderation; and this brings all to rights again.</p>

<p>For a Body like this, what can it not do? what cannot such an
Extension perform in the Air? And when one thing is tackt to
another, and properly <i>Cosolidated</i> into one mighty
<i>Consolidator</i>, no question but whoever shall go up to the
<i>Moon</i>, will find himself so improv'd in this wonderful
Experiment, that not a Man ever perform'd that wonderful Flight,
but he certainly came back again as wise as he went.</p>

<p>Well, Gentlemen, and what if we are called <i>High-flyers</i>
now, and an Hundred Names of Contempt and Distinction, what is this
to the purpose? who would not be a <i>High-flyer</i>, to be Tackt
and <i>Consolidated</i> in an Engine of such sublime Elevation, and
which lifts Men, Monarchs, Members, yea, and whole Nations, up into
the Clouds; and performs with such wondrous Art, the long expected
Experiment of a Voyage to the <i>Moon</i>? And thus much for the
Description of the <i>Consolidator</i>.</p>

<p>The first Voyage I ever made to this Country, was in one of
these Engines; and I can safely affirm, I never wak'd all the way;
and now having been as often there as most that have us'd that
Trade, it may be expected I should give some Account of the
Country; for it appears, I can give but little of the Road.</p>

<p>Only this I understand, That when this Engine, by help of these
Artificial Wings, has raised it self up to a certain height, the
Wings are as useful to keep it from falling into the <i>Moon</i>,
as they were before to raise it, and keep it from falling back into
this Region again.</p>

<p>This may happen from an Alteration of Centers, and Gravity
having past a certain Line, the Equipoise changes its Tendency, the
Magnetick Quality being beyond it, it inclines of Course, and
pursues a Center, which it finds in the <i>Lunar World</i>, and
lands us safe upon the Surface.</p>

<p>I was told, I need take no Bills of Exchange with me, nor
Letters of Credit; for that upon my first Arrival, the Inhabitants
would be very civil to me: That they never suffered any of <i>Our
World</i> to want any thing when they came there: That they were
very free to show them any thing, and inform them in all needful
Cases; and that whatever Rarities the Country afforded, should be
expos'd immediately.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into the Customs, Geography, or History of the
Place, only acquaint the Reader, That I found no manner of
Difference in any thing Natural, except as hereafter excepted, but
all was exactly as is here, an Elementary World, peopled with
Folks, <i>as like us</i> as if they were only Inhabitants of the
same Continent, but in a remote Climate.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants were <i>Men</i>, <i>Women</i>, <i>Beasts</i>,
<i>Birds</i>, <i>Fishes</i>, and <i>Insects</i>, of the same
individual Species as Ours, the latter excepted: The <i>Men</i> no
wiser, better, nor bigger than here; the <i>Women</i> no handsomer
or honester than Ours: There were Knaves and honest Men, honest
Women and Whores of all Sorts, Countries, Nations and Kindreds, as
on this side the Skies.</p>

<p>They had the same Sun to shine, the Planets were equally visible
<i>as to us</i>, and <i>their Astrologers</i> were as busily
Impertinent as Ours, only that those wonderful Glasses hinted
before made strange Discoveries that we were unacquainted with; by
them they could plainly discover, That <i>this</i> World was
<i>their</i> Moon, and <i>their</i> World <i>our</i> Moon; and when
I came first among them, the People that flockt about me,
distinguisht me by the Name of, <i>the Man that came out of the
Moon</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, but acquaint the Reader, with some Remarks I
made in this new World, before I come to any thing Historical.</p>

<p>I have heard, that among the Generallity of our People, who
being not much addicted to Revelation, have much concern'd
themselves about Demonstrations, a Generation have risen up, who to
solve the Difficulties of Supernatural Systems, imagine <i>a mighty
vast Something</i>, who has no Form but what represents him to them
as one <i>Great Eye:</i> This infinite Optick they imagine to be
<i>Natura Naturans</i>, or Power-forming; and that as we pretend
the Soul of Man has a Similitude in quality to its Original,
according to a Notion some People have, who read that so much
ridicul'd Old Legend, call'd <i>Bible</i>, That <i>Man was made in
the Image of his Maker:</i> The Soul of Man, therefore, in the
Opinion of these Naturallists, is <i>one vast Optick Power</i>
diffus'd through him into all his Parts, but seated principally in
his Head.</p>

<p>From hence they resolve all Beings to <i>Eyes</i>, some more
capable of Sight and receptive of Objects than others; and as to
things Invisible, they reckon nothing so, only so far as our Sight
is deficient, contracted or darkened by Accidents from without, as
Distance of Place, Interposition of Vapours, Clouds, liquid Air,
Exhalations, <i>&amp;c.</i> or from within, as <i>wandring
Errors</i>, <i>wild Notions</i>, <i>cloudy Understandings</i>, and
<i>empty Fancies</i>, with a Thousand other interposing Obstacles
to the Sight, which darken it, and prevent its Operation; and
particularly obstruct the perceptive Faculties, weaken the Head,
and bring Mankind in General to stand in need of the <i>Spectacles
of Education</i> as soon as ever they are born: Nay, and as soon as
they have made use of these Artificial Eyes, all they can do is but
to clear the Sight so far as <i>to see</i> that <i>they can't
see</i>; the utmost Wisdom of Mankind, and the highest Improvement
a Man ought to wish for, being but to be able to see that <i>he was
Born blind</i>; this pushes him upon search after Mediums for the
Recovery of his Sight, and <i>away he runs to School</i> to Art and
Science, and there he is furnisht with <i>Horoscopes</i>,
<i>Microscopes</i>, <i>Tellescopes</i>, <i>C&aelig;liscopes</i>,
<i>Money-scopes</i>, and the D---l and and all of Glasses, to help
and assist his <i>Moon-blind Understanding</i>; these with
wonderful Skill and Ages of Application, after wandring thro' Bogs
and Wildernesses of <i>Guess</i>, <i>Conjectures</i>,
<i>Supposes</i>, <i>Calculations</i>, and he knows not what, which
he meets with in <i>Physicks</i>, <i>Politicks</i>, <i>Ethicks</i>,
<i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Mathematicks</i>, and such sort of bewildring
Things, bring him with vast Difficulty to a little Minute-spot,
call'd <i>Demonstration</i>; and as not one in Ten Thousand ever
finds the way thither, but are lost in the tiresome uncouth
Journey, so they <i>that do</i>, 'tis so long before they come
there, that they are grown Old and good for little in the Journey;
and no sooner have they obtained a glimering of this Universal
<i>Eye-sight</i>, this <i>Eclaricissment General</i>, but they
<i>Die</i>, and have hardly time to show the way to those that come
after.</p>

<p>Now, as the earnest search after this thing call'd
<i>Demonstration</i> fill'd me with Desires of seeing every thing,
so my Observations of the strange multitude of Mysteries I met with
in all Men's Actions here, spurr'd my Curiosity to examine, if
<i>the Great Eye</i> of the World had no People to whom he had
given a clearer Eye-sight, or at least, that made a better use of
it than we had here.</p>

<p>If pursuing this search I was much delighted at my Arrival into
<i>China</i>, it cannot be thought strange, since there we find
Knowledge as much advanc'd beyond our common Pitch, as it was
pretended to be deriv'd from a more Ancient Original.</p>

<p>We are told, that in the early Age of the World, the Strength of
Invention exceeded all that ever has been arrived to since: That we
in these latter Ages, having lost all that pristine Strength of
Reason and Invention, which died with the Ancients in the Flood,
and receiving no helps from that Age, have by long Search arriv'd
at several remote Parts of Knowledge, by the helps of reading
Conversation and Experience; but that all amounts to no more than
faint Imitations, Apings, and Resemblances of what was known in
those masterly Ages.</p>

<p>Now, if it be true as is hinted before, That the <i>Chinese</i>
Empire was Peopled long before the Flood; and that they were not
destroyed in the General Deluge in the Days of <i>Noah</i>; 'tis no
such strange thing, that they should so much out-do us in this sort
of <i>Eye-sight</i> we call <i>General Knowledge</i>, since the
Perfections bestow'd on Nature, when in her Youth and Prime met
with no General Suffocation by that Calamity.</p>

<p>But if I was extreamly delighted with the extraordinary things I
saw in those Countries, you cannot but imagine I was exceedingly
mov'd, when I heard of a <i>Lunar</i> World; and that the way was
passable from these Parts.</p>

<p>I had heard of a <i>World in the Moon</i> among some of our
Learned Philosophers, and <i>Moor</i>, as I have been told, had
<i>a Moon</i> in his Head; but none of the fine Pretenders, no not
Bishop <i>Wilkins</i>, ever found Mechanick Engines, whose Motion
was sufficient to attempt the Passage. A late happy Author indeed,
among his Mechanick Operations of the Spirit, had found out an
Enthusiasm, which if he could have pursued to its proper Extream,
without doubt might, <i>either in the Body or out of the Body</i>,
have Landed him somewhere hereabout; but that he form'd his System
wholly upon the mistaken Notion of <i>Wind</i>, which Learned
Hypothesis being directly contrary to the Nature of things in this
Climate, where the <i>Elasticity</i> of the Air is quite different
and where the <i>pressure of the Atmosphere</i> has for want of
Vapour no Force, all his Notion dissolv'd in its Native Vapour
call'd <i>Wind</i>, and flew upward in blew Strakes of a livid
Flame call'd <i>Blasphemy</i>, which burnt up all the Wit and Fancy
of the Author, and left a strange <i>stench</i> behind it, that has
this unhappy quality in it, that every Body that Reads the Book,
<i>smells the Author</i>, tho' he be never so far off; nay, tho' he
took Shipping to <i>Dublin</i>, to secure his Friends from the
least danger of a Conjecture.</p>

<p>But to return, to the happy Regions of the <i>Lunar
Continent</i>, I was no sooner Landed there, and had lookt about
me, but I was surpriz'd with the strange Alteration of the Climate
and Country; and particularly a strange Salubrity and Fragrancy in
the Air, which I felt so Nourishing, so Pleasant and Delightful,
that tho' I could perceive some small Respiration, it was hardly
discernable, and the least requisite for Life, supplied so long
that the Bellows of Nature were hardly imployed.</p>

<p>But as I shall take occasion to consider this in a Critical
Examination into the Nature, Uses and Advantages of <i>Good
Lungs</i>, of which by it self, so I think fit to confine my
present Observations to things more particularly concerning the
<i>Eye-sight</i>.</p>

<p>I was, you may be sure, not a little surprized, when being upon
an Eminence I found my self capable by common Observation, to see
and distinguish things at the distance of 100 Miles and more, and
seeking some Information on this point, I was acquainted by the
People, that there was <i>a certain grave Philosopher</i> hard by,
that could give me a very good Account of things.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to tell you this Man's <i>Lunar Name</i>,
of whether he had a Name, or no; 'tis plain, 'twas a <i>Man in the
Moon</i>; but all the Conference I had with him was very strange:
At my first coming to him, he askt me if I came from the <i>World
in the Moon</i>? I told him, <i>no:</i> At which he began to be
angry, told me <i>I Ly'd</i>, he knew whence I came as well as I
did; for he saw me all the way. I told him, I came <i>to the World
in the Moon</i>, and began to be as surly as he. It was a long time
before we could agree about it, he would have it, that I came down
from <i>the Moon</i>; and I, that I came <i>up to the Moon:</i>
From this, we came to Explications, Demonstrations, Spheres,
Globes, Regions, Atmospheres, and a Thousand odd Diagrams, to make
the thing out to one another. I insisted on my part, as that my
Experiment qualified me to know, and challeng'd him to <i>go back
with me</i> to prove it. He, like a true Philosopher, raised a
Thousand Scruples, Conjectures, and Spherical Problems, to Confront
me; and as for Demonstrations, he call'd 'em Fancies of my own.
Thus we differ'd a great many ways; both of us were certain, and
both uncertain; both right, and yet both directly contrary; how to
reconcile this Jangle was very hard, till at last this
Demonstration happen'd, the Moon as he call'd it, turning her
blind-side upon us three Days after the Change, by which, with the
help of his extraordinary Glasses, I that knew the Country,
perceived that side the <i>Sun</i> lookt upon was <i>all Moon</i>,
and the other was <i>all world</i>; and either I fancy'd I saw or
else really saw all the lofty Towers of the Immense Cities of
<i>China:</i> Upon this, and a little more Debate, we came to this
Conclusion, and there the Old Man and I agreed, That they were
<i>both Moons</i> and <i>both Worlds</i>, this <i>a Moon</i> to
that, and that <i>a Moon</i> to this, like the Sun between two
Looking-Glasses, and shone upon one another by Reflection,
according to the oblique or direct Position of each other.</p>

<p>This afforded us a great deal of Pleasure; for all the World
covet to be found in the right, and are pleas'd when their Notions
are acknowledg'd by their Antagonists: It also afforded us many
very useful Speculations, such as these;</p>

<p>1. How easy it is for Men to <i>fall out</i>, and yet all sides
to be in the <i>right?</i></p>

<p>2. How Natural it is for <i>Opinion</i> to despise
<i>Demonstration?</i></p>

<p>3. How proper mutual <i>Enquiry</i> is to mutual
<i>Satisfaction?</i></p>

<p>From the Observation of these Glasses, we also drew some
<i>Puns</i>, <i>Crotchets</i> and <i>Conclusions</i>.</p>

<p>1<i>st</i>, That the whole World has a <i>Blind-side</i>, a
<i>Dark-side</i>, and a <i>Bright-side</i>, and consequently so has
every Body in it.</p>

<p>2<i>dly</i>, That the <i>Dark-side</i> of Affairs <i>to Day</i>,
may be the <i>Bright-side to Morrow</i>; from whence abundance of
useful Morals were also raised; such as,</p>

<p>1. No Man's Fate is so dark, but when the <i>Sun</i> shines upon
it, it will return its Rays, and shine for it self.</p>

<p>2. All things turn like the <i>Moon</i>, <i>up</i> to Day,
<i>down</i> to Morrow, <i>Full</i> and <i>Change</i>, <i>Flux</i>
and <i>Reflux</i>.</p>

<p>3. Humane Understanding is like the <i>Moon</i> at the First
Quarter, <i>half dark</i>.</p>

<p>3<i>dly</i>, The <i>Changing-sides</i> ought not to be thought
so strange, or so much Condemn'd by Mankind, having its Original
from the <i>Lunar Influence</i>, and govern'd by the Powerful
Operation of Heavenly Motion.</p>

<p>4<i>thly</i>, If there be any such thing as Destiny in the
World, I know nothing Man is so predestinated to, as to be
eternally turning round; and but that I purpose to entertain the
Reader with at least a whole Chapter or Section of the Philosophy
of <i>Humane Motion</i>, Spherically and <i>Hypocritically
Examin'd</i> and <i>Calculated</i>, I should inlarge upon that
Thought in this place.</p>

<p>Having thus jumpt in our Opinions, and perfectly satisfied our
selves with Demonstration, That these Worlds were Sisters, both in
Form, Function, and all their Capacities; in short, a pair of
<i>Moons</i>, and a pair of <i>Worlds</i>, equally Magnetical,
Sympathetical, and Influential, we set up our rest as to that
Affair, and went forward.</p>

<p>I desir'd no better Acquaintance in my new Travels, than this
new Sociate; never was there such a Couple of People met; he was
the <i>Man in the Moon</i> to me, and I <i>the Man in the Moon</i>
to him; he wrote down all I said, and made a Book of it, and call'd
it, <i>News from the World in the</i> Moon; and all the Town is
like to see <i>my Minutes</i> under the same Title; nay, and I have
been told, he published some such bold Truths there, from the
Allegorical Relations he had of me from our World: That he was
call'd before the Publick Authority, who could not bear the just
Reflections of his <i>damn'd Satyrical way of Writing</i>; and
there they punisht the Poor Man, put him in Prison, ruin'd his
Family; and not only Fin'd him <i>Ultra tenementum</i>, but expos'd
him in the <i>high Places of their Capital City</i>, for the Mob to
laugh at him for a Fool: This is a Punishment not unlike <i>our
Pillory</i>, and was appointed for <i>mean Criminals</i>, Fellows
that Cheat and Couzen People, Forge Writings, Forswear themselves,
and the like; and the People, that it was expected would have
treated this Man very ill, on the contrary <i>Pitied him</i>, wisht
those that set him there placed in his room, and exprest their
Affections, by <i>loud Shouts</i> and Acclamations, when he was
taken down.</p>

<p>But as this happen'd before my first Visit to that World, when I
came there all was over with him, his particular Enemies were
disgrac'd and turn'd out, and the Man was not at all the worse
receiv'd by his Country-folks than he was before; and so much for
the <i>Man in the</i> Moon.</p>

<p>After we had settled the Debate between us, about the Nature and
Quality, I desir'd him to show me some Plan or Draft of <i>this new
World</i> of his; upon which, he brought me out a pair of very
beautiful Globes, and there I had an immediate Geographical
Description of the Place.</p>

<p>I found it less by Degrees than Our <i>Terrestial Globe</i>, but
more Land and less Water; and as I was particularly concern'd to
see something in or near the same Climate with Our selves, I
observ'd a large extended Country to the North, about the Latitude
of 50 to 56 Northern Distance; and enquiring of that Country, he
told me it was one of the best Countries in all their World: That
it was his Native Climate, and he was just a going to it, and would
take me with him.</p>

<p>He told me in General, the Country was Good, Wholsome, Fruitful,
rarely Scituate for Trade, extraordinarily Accommodated with
Harbours, Rivers and Bays for Shipping; full of Inhabitants; for it
had been Peopled from all Parts, and had in it some of the Blood of
all the Nations in the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>He told me, as the Inhabitants were the most Numerous, so they
were the strangest People that liv'd; both their Natures, Tempers,
Qualities, Actions, and way of Living, was made up of innumerable
Contradictions: That they were the <i>Wisest</i> Fools, and the
<i>Foolishest</i> Wise Men in the World; the <i>Weakest</i>
Strongest, <i>Richest</i> Poorest, most <i>Generous</i> Covetous,
<i>Bold</i> Cowardly, <i>False</i> Faithful, <i>Sober</i>
Dissolute, <i>Surly</i> Civil, <i>Slothful</i> Diligent,
<i>Peaceable</i> Quarrelling, <i>Loyal</i> Seditious Nation that
ever was known.</p>

<p>Besides my Observations which I made my self, and which could
only furnish me with what was present, and which I shall take time
to inform my Reader with as much Care and Conciseness as possible;
I was beholding to this Old <i>Lunarian</i>, for every thing that
was Historical or Particular.</p>

<p>And First, He inform'd me, That in this new Country they had
very seldom any Clouds at all, and consequently no extraordinary
Storms, but a constant Serenity, moderate Breezes cooled the Air,
and constant Evening Exhalations kept the Earth moist and fruitful;
and as the Winds they had were various and strong enough to assist
their Navigation, so they were without the Terrors, Dangers,
Ship-wrecks and Destructions, which he knew we were troubled with
in this our <i>Lunar</i> World, as he call'd it.</p>

<p>The first just Observation I made of this was, That I suppos'd
from hence the wonderful Clearness of the Air, and the Advantage of
so vast Optick Capacities they enjoy'd, was obtained: <i>Alas</i>!
says the Old Fellow, <i>You see nothing to what some of our</i>
Great Eyes <i>see in some Parts of this World, nor do you see any
thing compar'd to what you may see by the help of some new Invented
Glasses, of which I may in time let you see the Experiment</i>;
<i>and perhaps you may find this to be the reason why we do not so
abound in Books as in your</i> Lunar World; <i>and that except it
be some extraordinary</i> Translations <i>out of your Country, you
will find but little in our Libraries, worth giving you a great
deal of Trouble</i>.</p>

<p>We immediately quitted the Philosophical Discourse of Winds, and
I began to be mighty Inquisitive after these Glasses and
Translations, and</p>

<p>1<i>st</i>, I understood here was
a strange sort of Glass that did not so much bring to the Eye, as
by I know not what wonderful Operation carried out the Eye to the
Object, and quite varies from all our Doctrine of Opticks, by
forming several strange <i>Ph&aelig;nomena</i> in Sight, which we
are utterly unacquainted with; nor could <i>Vision</i>,
<i>Rarification</i>, or any of our School-mens fine Terms, stand me
in any stead in this case; but here was such Additions of
<i>piercing Organs</i>, Particles of <i>Transparence</i>,
<i>Emission</i>, <i>Transmission</i>, <i>Mediums</i>, Contraction
of <i>Rays</i>, and a Thousand Applications of things prepar'd for
the wondrous Operation, that you may be sure are requisite for the
bringing to pass something yet unheard of on this side the
<i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>First we were inform'd, by the help of these Glasses, strange
things, which pass in our World for Non-Entities, is to be seen,
and very perceptible; for Example:</p>

<p><i>State Polity</i>, in all its Meanders, Shifts, Turns, Tricks,
and Contraries, are so exactly Delineated and Describ'd, That they
are in hopes in time to draw a pair of Globes out, to bring all
those things to a certainty.</p>

<p>Not but that it made some Puzzle, even among these Clear-sighted
Nations, to determine what <i>Figure</i> the Plans and Drafts of
this undiscover'd <i>World of Mysteries</i> ought to be describ'd
in: Some were of Opinion, it ought, to be an <i>Irregular
Centagon</i>, a Figure with an Hundred <i>Cones</i> or Angles:
Since the <i>Unaccountables</i> of this State-Science, are hid in a
Million of <i>undiscover'd Corners</i>; as the Craft, Subtilty and
Hypocrisy of Knaves and Courtiers have concealed them, never to be
found out, but by this wonderful <i>D---l-scope</i>, which seem'd
to threaten a perfect Discovery of all those <i>Nudities</i>, which
have lain hid in the Embrio, and false Conceptions of <i>Abortive
Policy</i>, ever since the Foundation of the World.</p>

<p>Some were of Opinion, this Plan ought to be Circular, and in a
Globular Form, since it was on all sides alike, full of <i>dark
Spots</i>, untrod Mazes, <i>waking Mischiefs</i>, and sleeping
Mysteries; and being delineated like the Globes display'd, would
discover all the Lines of Wickedness to the Eye at one view:
Besides, they fancied some sort of Analogy in the Rotundity of the
Figure, with the continued Circular Motion of all Court-Policies,
in the stated Round of Universal Knavery.</p>

<p>Others would have had it <i>Hyrogliphical</i> as by a <i>Hand in
Hand</i>, the Form representing the Affinity between <i>State
Policy</i> here, and <i>State Policy</i> in the Infernal Regions,
with some unkind Similies between the Oeconomy of Satan's Kingdom,
and those of most of the Temporal Powers on Earth; but this was
thought too unkind. At last it was determin'd, That neither of
these Schemes were capable of the vast Description; and that,
therefore, the Drafts must be made single, tho' not dividing the
Governments, yet dividing the Arts of Governing into proper
distinct Schemes, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. A particular Plan of <i>Publick Faith</i>; and here we had
the Experiment immediately made: The Representation is quallified
for the Meridian of any <i>Country</i>, as well in <i>our World</i>
as <i>theirs</i>; and turning it to'ards <i>our own World</i>,
there I saw plainly an <i>Exchequer shut up</i>, and 20000 Mourning
Families selling their <i>Coaches</i>, <i>Horses</i>,
<i>Whores</i>, <i>Equipages</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> for Bread, the
Government standing by laughing, and looking on: Hard by I saw the
<i>Chamber</i> of a great City shut up, and Forty Thousand
<i>Orphans</i> turn'd adrift in the World; some had no
<i>Cloaths</i>, some no <i>Shoes</i>, some no <i>Money</i>; and
still the City Magistrates calling upon other Orphans, to <i>pay
their money in</i>. These things put me in mind of the Prophet
<i>Ezekiel</i>, and methoughts I heard the same Voice that spoke to
him, calling me, and telling me, <i>Come hither, and I'll show thee
greater Abominations than these:</i> So looking still on that vast
Map, by the help of these Magnifying Glasses, I saw <i>huge Fleets
hir'd for Transport-Service, but never paid</i>; vast Taxes
<i>Anticipated</i>, that were never Collected; others Collected and
<i>Appropriated</i>, but Misapplied: Millions of <i>Talleys</i>
struck to be Discounted, and the Poor paying 40 <i>per Cent</i>, to
receive their Money. I saw huge Quantities of Money <i>drawn
in</i>, and little or none <i>issued out</i>; vast Prizes taken
<i>from the Enemy</i>, and then taken away again at home by
<i>Friends</i>; Ships <i>sav'd</i> on the Sea, and sunk in the
<i>Prize Offices</i>; Merchants <i>escaping</i> from Enemies at
Sea, and be <i>Pirated</i> by <i>Sham Embargoes</i>, <i>Counterfeit
Claims</i>, <i>Confiscations</i>, <i>&amp;c</i> a-shoar: There we
saw <i>Turkey-Fleets</i> taken into Convoys, and Guarded to the
very Mouth of the Enemy, and then <i>abandon'd for their better
Security</i>: Here we saw Mons. <i>Pouchartrain</i> shutting up the
Town-house of <i>Paris</i>, and plundring the Bank of
<i>Lyons</i>.</p>

<p>2. Here we law the State of the War among Nations; Here was the
<i>French</i> giving Sham-thanks for Victories they never got, and
some body else adressing and congratulating <i>the sublime Glory of
running away:</i> Here was <i>Te Deum</i> for Sham-Victories by
Land; and there was Thanksgiving for <i>Ditto by Sea:</i> Here we
might see two Armies fight, both run away, and <i>both come and
thank GOD for nothing:</i> Here we saw a Plan of a late War like
that in <i>Ireland</i>; there was all the Officers <i>cursing a</i>
Dutch <i>General</i>, because the damn'd Rogue would fight, and
<i>spoil a good War</i>, that with decent Management and <i>good
Husbandry</i>, might have been <i>eek't out</i> this Twenty Years;
there was whole Armies hunting two <i>Cows</i> to one
<i>Irishman</i>, and driving of black Cattle declar'd the <i>Noble
End of the the War:</i> Here we saw a Country full of Stone Walls
and strong Towns, where every Campaign, the Trade of War was
carried on by the Soldiers, with the same Intriguing as it was
carried on in the Council Chambers; there was Millions of
Contributions raised, and vast Sums Collected, but no <i>Taxes
lessen'd</i>; whole <i>Plate Fleets</i> surpriz'd, but no
<i>Treasure found</i>; vaft Sums <i>lost</i> by Enemies, and yet
never <i>found</i> by Friends, Ships loaded with Volatile Silver,
that came away <i>full</i>, and gat home <i>empty</i>; whole
Voyages made to beat <i>No body</i>, and plunder <i>Every body</i>;
two Millions robb'd from the honest Merchants, and not a Groat
sav'd for the honest Subjects: There we saw Captains Lifting Men
with the Governments Money, and letting them go again for their
own; Ships fitted out at the Rates of Two Millions a Year, to fight
but once in Three Years, and then <i>run away</i> for want of
Powder and Shot.</p>

<p>There we saw <i>Partition Treaties</i> damned, and the whole
given away, <i>Confederations</i> without <i>Allies</i>,
<i>Allies</i> without <i>Quota's</i>, <i>Princes</i> without
<i>Armies</i>, <i>Armies</i> without <i>Men</i>, and <i>Men</i>
without <i>Money</i>, <i>Crowns</i> without <i>Kings</i>,
<i>Kings</i> without <i>Subjects</i>, more <i>Kings</i> than
<i>Countries</i>, and more <i>Countries</i> than were worth
fighting for.</p>

<p>Here we could see the King of <i>France</i> upbraiding his
Neighbours with dishonourably assisting his Rebels, <i>though the
Mischief was, they did it not neither</i>; and in the same Breath,
assisting the <i>Hungarian</i> Rebels against the Emperor;
<i>M.</i> Ld <i>N.</i> refusing so dishonourable an Action, as to
aid the Rebellious <i>Camisars</i>, but Leaguing with the Admirant
<i>de Castile</i>, to Invade the Dominions of his Master to whom he
swore Allegiance: Here we saw Protestants fight against
Protestants, <i>to help Papists</i>, Papists against Papists <i>to
help Protestants</i>, Protestants call in Turks, to keep Faith
against Christians <i>that break it:</i> Here we could see
<i>Swedes</i> fighting for Revenge, and call it Religion;
<i>Cardinals</i> deposing their Catholick Prince, to introduce the
Tyranny <i>of a Lutheran</i> and call it Liberty; <i>Armies</i>
Electing Kings, and call it Free Choice; <i>French</i> conquering
<i>Savoy</i>, to secure the Liberty of <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<p>3. The Map of State Policy contains abundance of Civil
Transactions, no where to be discover'd but in this <i>wonderful
Country</i>, and by this prodigious Invention: As first, it shows
an Eminent Prelate running in every body's Debt to relieve the
Poor, and bring to <i>God</i> Robbery for <i>Burnt-Offering:</i> It
opens a Door to the Fate of Nations; and there we might see the
<i>Duke of S--y</i> bought three times, and his subjects sold every
time; <i>Portugal</i> bought twice, and neither time worth <i>the
Earnest</i>; <i>Spain</i> bought once, but loth to go with the
<i>Bidder</i>; <i>Venice</i> willing to be Bought, if there had
been any Buyers; <i>Bavaria</i> Bought, and run away with the
<i>Money</i>; the Emperor <i>Bought</i> and <i>Sold</i>, but Bilkt
the Chapman; the <i>French</i> buying Kingdoms he can't
<i>keep</i>, the <i>Dutch</i> keep Kingdoms they never
<i>Bought</i>; and the <i>English</i> paying their Money without
<i>Purchase</i>.</p>

<p>In Matters of Civil Concerns, here was to be seen
<i>Religion</i> with no out-side, and much <i>Out-side</i> with no
Religion, much Strife about <i>Peace</i>, and no Peace in the
<i>Design:</i> Here was Plunder without <i>Violence</i>, Violence
without <i>Persecution</i>, Conscience without <i>Good Works</i>,
and Good Works without <i>Charity</i>; Parties cutting one anothers
Throats <i>for God's Sake</i>, pulling down Churches <i>de
propoganda fide</i>, and making Divisions by way of
<i>Association</i>.</p>

<p>Here we have <i>Peace and Union</i> brought to pass <i>The
Shortest Way</i>, Extirpation and Destruction prov'd to be the Road
to <i>Plenty</i> and <i>Pleasure:</i> Here all the Wise Nations, a
Learned Author would have Quoted, <i>if he could have found
them</i>, are to be seen, who carry on Exclusive Laws to the
general Safety and Satisfaction of their Subjects.</p>

<p><i>Occasional Bills</i> may have here a particular Historical,
Categorical Description: But of them by themselves.</p>

<p>Here you might have the Rise, Original, Lawfulness, Usefulness,
and Necessity of <i>Passive Obedience</i>, as fairly represented as
a System of Divinity, and as clearly demonstrated <i>as by a
Geographical Description</i>; and which exceeds our mean
Understanding here, 'tis by the wonderful Assistance of these
Glasses, plainly discerned to be Coherent <i>with Resistance</i>,
<i>taking Arms</i>, <i>calling in Foreign Powers</i>, <i>and the
like.</i> --- Here you have a plain Discovery of <i>C.</i> of
<i>E.</i> Politicks, and a Map of Loyalty: Here 'tis as plainly
demonstrated as the Nose in a Man's Face, <i>provided he has
one</i>, that a Man may <i>Abdicate</i>, drive away, and
<i>Dethrone</i> his Prince, and yet be absolutely and intirely free
from, and innocent of the least <i>Fracture</i>, Breach,
Incroachment, or Intrenchment, upon the Doctrine of
<i>Non-Resistance:</i> Can <i>shoot</i> at his Prince without any
Design to <i>kill him</i>, <i>fight</i> against him without raising
<i>Rebellion</i>, and take up Arms, without leaving War against his
Prince.</p>

<p>Here they can persecute Dissenters, without desiring they should
Conform, conform to the Church they would overthrow; <i>Pray</i>
for the Prince they <i>dare not Name</i>, and <i>Name</i> the
Prince they <i>do not pray for</i>.</p>

<p>By the help of these Glasses strange Insights are made, into the
vast mysterious dark World of <i>State Policy</i>; but that which
is yet more strange, and requires vast Volumes to descend to the
Particulars of, and huge Diagrams, Spheres, Charts, and a Thousand
nice things to display is, That in this vast Intelligent Discovery
it is not only made plain, that those things are so, but all the
vast Contradictions are made Rational, reconciled to Practice, and
brought down to Demonstration.</p>

<p><i>German Clock-Work</i>, the perpetual Motions, the Prim
Mobilies of Our short-sighted World, are Trifles to these Nicer
Disquisitions.</p>

<p>Here it would be plain and rational, why a Parliament-Man will
spend 5000 <i>l.</i> to be Chosen, that cannot get a Groat Honestly
by <i>setting there</i>: It would be easily made out to be
rational, why he that <i>rails most</i> at a Court is soonest
receiv'd <i>into it:</i> Here it would be very plain, how great
Estates are got in <i>little Places</i>, and Double in <i>none at
all</i>. 'Tis easy to be prov'd honest and faithful to Victual the
<i>French</i> Fleet out of <i>English</i> Stores, and let our own
Navy want them; a long Sight, or a large Lunar Perspective, will
make all these things not only plain in Fact, but Rational and
Justifiable to all the World.</p>

<p>'Tis a strange thing to any body without doubt, that has not
been in that <i>clear-sighted Region</i>, to comprehend, That those
we call <i>High-flyers</i> in <i>England</i> are the only Friends
<i>to the Dissenters</i>, and have been the most Diligent and
Faithful in their Interest, of any People in the Nation; and yet so
it is, <i>Gentlemen</i>, and they ought to have the Thanks of the
<i>whole Body</i> for it.</p>

<p>In this advanc'd Station, we see it plainly by Reflexion, That
the Dissenters, like a parcel of Knaves, have retained all the
<i>High-Church-men</i> in their Pay; they are certainly all in
their <i>Pension-Roll:</i> Indeed, I could not see the Money paid
them there, it was too remote; but I could plainly see the thing;
all the deep Lines of the Project are laid as true, they are so
<i>Tackt</i> and <i>Consolidated</i> together, that if any one will
give themselves leave to consider, they will be most effectually
convinced, That the <i>High-Church</i> and the <i>Dissenters</i>
here, are all in a Caball, a meer Knot, a piece of Clock-work; the
Dissenters are the Dial-Plate, and the High-Church the Movement,
the <i>Wheel within the Wheels</i>, the Spring and the Screw to
bring all things to Motion, and make the <i>Hand</i> on the
<i>Dial-plate</i> point which way the <i>Dissenters</i> please.</p>

<p>For what else have been <i>all the Shams</i> they have put upon
the <i>Governments</i>, Kings, States, and People they have been
concern'd with? What Schemes have they laid on purpose <i>to be
broken?</i> What vast Contrivances, on purpose to be ridicul'd and
expos'd? <i>The Men are not Fools</i>, they had never V---d to
<i>Consolidate</i> a <i>B---</i> but that they were willing to save
the Dissenters, and put it into a posture, in which they <i>were
sure it would miscarry</i>. I defy all the Wise Men of the
<i>Moon</i> to show another good reason for it.</p>

<p>Methinks I begin to pity my Brethren, the moderate Men of the
Church, that they cannot see into this <i>New Plot</i>, and to wish
they would but get up into our <i>Consolidator</i>, and take a
Journey to the <i>Moon</i>, and there, by the help of these
Glasses, they would see the <i>Allegorical</i>, <i>Symbollical</i>,
<i>Hetrodoxicallity</i> of all this Matter; it would make immediate
Converts of them; they would see plainly, that to <i>Tack</i> and
<i>Consolidate</i>, to make <i>Exclusive Laws</i>, to
<i>persecute</i> for Conscience, <i>disturb</i>, and
<i>distress</i> Parties; these are all <i>Phanatick Plots</i>, meer
Combinations against the Church, to bring her into Contempt, and to
fix and establish the Dissenters to the end of the Chapter: But of
this I shall find <i>occasion</i> to speak <i>Occasionally</i>,
when an <i>Occasion</i> presents it self, to examine a certain
<i>Occasional Bill</i>, transacting in these Lunar Regions, some
time before I had the Happiness to arrive there.</p>

<p>In examining the Multitude and Variety of these <i>most
admirable Glasses</i> for the assisting the <i>Opticks</i>, or
indeed the Formation of a new perceptive Faculty; it was you may be
sure most surprizing to find there, that Art had exceeded Nature;
and the Power of Vision was assisted to that prodigious Degree, as
even to distinguish <i>Non-Entity it self</i>; and in these strange
Engines of Light it could not but be very pleasing, to distinguish
plainly betwixt <i>Being</i> and <i>Matter</i>, and to come to a
Determination, in the so long Canvast Dispute of Substance, <i>vel
Materialis, vel Spiritualis</i>; and I can solidly affirm, That in
all our Contention between <i>Entity</i> and <i>Non-Entity</i>,
there is so <i>little worth meddling with</i>, that had we had
these Glasses some Ages ago, we should have left troubling our
heads with it.</p>

<p>I take upon me, therefore, to assure my Reader, That whoever
pleases to take a Journey, or Voyage, or Flight up to these
<i>Lunar Regions</i>, as soon as ever he comes ashoar there, will
presently be convinc'd, of the Reasonableness of <i>Immaterial
Substance</i>, and the <i>Immortality</i>, as well as
<i>Immateriality</i> of the Soul: He will no sooner look into these
Explicating Glasses, but he will be-able to know the separate
meaning of <i>Body</i>, <i>Soul</i>, <i>Spirit</i>, <i>Life</i>,
<i>Motion</i>, <i>Death</i>, and a Thousand things that
<i>Wise-men</i> puzzle themselves about here, because they are not
<i>Fools enough to understand</i>.</p>

<p>Here too I find Glasses for the <i>Second Sight</i>, as our Old
Women call it. This <i>Second Sight</i> has been often pretended to
in <i>Our Regions</i>, and some Famous Old Wives have told us, they
can see <i>Death</i>, the <i>Soul</i>, <i>Futurity</i>, and the
Neighbourhood of them, in the Countenance: By this <i>wonderful
Art</i>, these good People unfold strange Mysteries, <i>as</i>
under some <i>Irrecoverable</i> Disease, to foretell <i>Death</i>;
under <i>Hypocondriack</i> Melancholy, to presage <i>Trouble of
Mind</i>; in pining Youth, to predict <i>Contagious Love</i>; and
an Hundred other Infallibilities, <i>which never fail to be true as
soon as ever they come to pass</i>, and are all grounded upon the
same Infallibility, by which a Shepherd may always know when any
one of his Sheep <i>is Rotten</i>, viz. <i>when he shakes himself
to pieces</i>.</p>

<p>But all this Guess and Uncertainty is a Trifle, to the vast
Discoveries of these <i>Explicatory Optick-Glasses</i>; for here
are seen the Nature and Consequences of Secret Mysteries: Here are
read strange Mysteries relating to <i>Predestination</i>,
<i>Eternal Decrees</i>, and the like: Here 'tis plainly prov'd,
That <i>Predestination</i> is, in spight of all Enthusiastick
Pretences, so intirely committed into Man's Power, that whoever
pleases to <i>hang himself to Day</i>, won't Live till to Morrow:
no, though <i>Forty Predestination Prophets</i> were to tell him,
<i>His time was not yet come</i>. There abstruse Points are
commonly and solemnly Discuss'd here; and these People are such
<i>Hereticks</i>, that they say <i>God's Decrees</i> are all
subservient to the means of his <i>Providence</i>; That what we
call Providence is a subjecting all things to the great <i>Chain of
Causes and Consequences</i>, by which that one Grand Decree, That
all Effects shall Obey, without reserve to their proper moving
Causes, supercedes all <i>subsequent Doctrines</i>, or pretended
Decrees, or Predestination in the World: That by this Rule, he that
<i>will kill himself</i>, <b>GOD</b>, Nature, Providence, or
Decree, will not be concern'd <i>to hinder him</i>, but <i>he shall
Die</i>; any Decrees, Predestination, or Fore-Knowledge of Infinite
Power, <i>to the contrary in any wise, notwithstanding</i> that it
is in a Man's Power to throw himself into the Water, <i>and be
Drown'd</i>; and to kill another Man, <i>and he shall Die</i>, and
to say, God appointed it, is to make him the Author of Murther, and
to injure the Murtherer in putting him to Death for what he could
not help doing.</p>

<p>All these things are <i>received Truths</i> here, and no doubt
would be so every where else, if the Eyes of Reason were opened to
the Testimony of Nature, or if they had the helps of these most
<i>Incomparable Glasses</i>.</p>

<p>Some pretended, by the help of these <i>Second-sight
Glasses</i>, to see the common Periods of Life; and Others said,
they could see a great way beyond <i>the leap in the Dark:</i> I
confess, all I could see of the first was, that holding up the
Glass against the Sea, I plainly saw, as it were on the edge of the
Horizon, these Words,</p>

<blockquote><i>The Verge of Life and Death is here.<br>
'Tis best to know where 'tis, but not how far.</i></blockquote>

<p>As to seeing <i>beyond Death</i>, all the Glasses I lookt into
for that purpose, <i>made but little of it</i>; and these were the
only <i>Tubes</i> that I found Defective; for here I could discern
nothing but Clouds, Mists, and thick dark hazy Weather; but
revolving in my Mind, that I had read a <i>certain Book</i> in our
own Country, called, <i>Nature</i>; it presently occurr'd, That the
Conclusion of it, to all such as gave themselves the trouble of
making out those foolish things call'd Inferences, was always
<i>Look up</i>; upon which, turning one of their Glasses <i>Up</i>,
and erecting the Point of it towards the <i>Zenith</i>, I saw these
Words in the Air, <i>REVELATION</i>, in large Capital Letters.</p>

<p>I had like to have rais'd the Mob upon me for looking
<i>upright</i> with this Glass; for this, they said, was prying
into the Mysteries of the Great <i>Eye</i> of the World; That we
ought to enquire no farther than he has inform'd us, and <i>to
believe</i> what he had left us <i>more Obscure:</i> Upon this, I
laid down the Glasses, and concluded, that we had <i>Moses</i> and
the <i>Prophets</i>, and should be never the likelier to be taught
by <i>One come from the</i> Moon.</p>

<p>In short, I found, indeed, they had a great deal more Knowledge
of things than we in this World; and that <i>Nature</i>,
<i>Science</i>, and <i>Reason</i>, had obtained great Improvements
in the <i>Lunar World</i>; but as to <i>Religion</i>, it was the
same equally resign'd to and concluded in <i>Faith</i> and
<i>Redemption</i>; so I shall give the World no great Information
of these things.</p>

<p>I come next to some other strange Acquirements obtained by the
helps of these Glasses; and particularly for the discerning the
<i>Imperceptibles</i> of Nature; such as, the <i>Soul</i>,
<i>Thought</i>, <i>Honesty</i>, <i>Religion</i>, <i>Virginity</i>,
and an Hundred other nice things, too small for humane
Discerning.</p>

<p>The Discoveries made by these Glasses, as to the <i>Soul</i>,
are of a very diverting Variety; some <i>Hieroglyphical</i>, and
<i>Emblematical</i>, and some Demonstrative.</p>

<p>The <i>Hieroglyphical</i> Discoveries of the Soul make it appear
in the <i>Image of its Maker</i>; and the Analogy is remarkable,
even in the very <i>Simily</i>; for as they represent the Original
of Nature as <i>One Great Eye</i>, illuminating as well as
discerning all things; so the <i>Soul</i>, in its
<i>Allegorical</i>, or <i>Hieroglyphical</i> Resemblance, appears
as a <i>Great Eye</i>, embracing the Man, enveloping, operating,
and informing every Part; <i>from whence</i> those sort of People
who we falsly call <i>Politicians</i>, acting so much to put out
<i>this Great Eye</i>, by acting against their common
Understandings, are very aptly represented by <i>a great Eye, with
Six or Seven pair of Spectacles on</i>; not but that the Eye of
their Souls may be clear enough of it self, as to the common
Understanding; but that they happen to have occasion to look
sometimes <i>so many ways at once</i>, and to judge, conclude, and
understand <i>so many contrary ways</i> upon one and the same
thing; that they are fain to put double Glasses upon their
Understanding, as we look at the <i>Solar Ecclipses</i>, to
represent 'em in <i>different Lights</i>, least <i>their
Judgments</i> should not <i>be wheadled</i> into a Compliance with
the <i>Hellish Resolutions of their Wills</i>; and this is what I
call the Emblematick Representation of the Soul.</p>

<p>As for the Demonstrations of the <i>Soul's Existence</i>, 'tis a
plain case, by these <i>Explicative Glasses</i>, that <i>it is</i>,
some have pretended to give us the Parts; and we have heard of
Chyrurgeons, that could read an Anatomical Lecture on the Parts Of
the Soul; and these pretend it to be a Creature in form, whether
<i>Camelion</i> or <i>Salamandar</i>, Authors have not determin'd;
nor is it compleatly discover'd <i>when</i> it comes into the Body,
or <i>how</i> it goes out, or <i>where</i> its Locality or
Habitation is, while 'tis a Resident.</p>

<p>But they very aptly show it, like a Prince, in his Seat, in the
middle of <i>his Palace the Brain</i>, issuing out his incessant
Orders to innumerable Troops of <i>Nerves</i>, <i>Sinews</i>,
<i>Muscles</i>, <i>Tendons</i>, <i>Veins</i>, <i>Arteries</i>,
<i>Fibres</i>, <i>Capilaris</i>, and <i>useful Officers</i>, call'd
<i>Organici</i>, who faithfully execute all the Parts of
<i>Sensation</i>, <i>Locomotion</i>, <i>Concoction</i>, &amp;c. and
in the Hundred Thousandth part of <i>a Moment</i>, return with
particular Messages for <i>Information</i>, and demand New
<i>Instructions</i>. If any part of <i>his Kingdom, the Body</i>,
suffers a Depredation, or an Invasion of the Enemy, the Expresses
fly to the Seat of the Soul, <i>the Brain</i>, and immediately are
order'd back <i>to smart</i>, that the Body may of course send more
Messengers <i>to complain</i>; immediately other Expresses are
dispatcht to the Tongue, with Orders <i>to cry out</i>, that the
Neighbours may come in and help, or Friends send for the
Chyrurgeon: Upon <i>the Application</i>, and a Cure, <i>all is
quiet</i>, and the same Expresses are dispatcht to the Tongue <i>to
be hush</i>, and say no more of it till farther Orders: All this is
as plain to be seen in these Engines, <i>as the Moon</i> of <i>Our
World</i> from the World in the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p>As the Being, Nature, and Scituation of <i>humane Soul</i> is
thus <i>Spherically</i> and <i>Mathematically</i> discover'd, I
could not find any Second Thoughts about it in all their Books,
whether of their own Composition or by Translation; for it was a
General received Notion, That there could not be a greater
Absurdity in humane Knowledge, than to imploy the Thoughts in
Questioning, what is as plainly known by its Consequences, as if
seen with <i>the Eye</i>; and that to doubt the Being or Extent of
the Soul's Operation, is to <i>imploy her against her self</i>; and
therefore, when I began to argue with my Old Philosopher, against
the Materiality and Immortality of this Mystery we call
<i>Soul</i>, <i>he laught at me</i>, and told me, he found we had
none of their Glasses in our World; and bid me send all our
<i>Scepticks</i>, <i>Soul-Sleepers</i>, our <i>Cowards</i>,
<i>Bakers</i>, <i>Kings</i> and <i>Bakewells</i>, up to him into
the <i>Moon</i>, if they wanted Demonstrations; where, by the help
of their Engines, they would make it plain to them, that the
<i>Great Eye</i> being one vast Intellect, <i>Infinite</i> and
<i>Eternal</i>, all <i>Inferior Life</i> is a Degree of
<i>himself</i>, and as exactly represents him as one little
<i>Flame</i> the whole <i>Mass of Fire</i>; That it is therefore
uncapable of Dissolution, being like its Original in Duration, as
well as in its Powers and Faculties, but that it goes and returns
by <i>Emission</i>, <i>Regression</i>, as the <i>Great Eye</i>
governs and determines; and this was plainly made out, by the
Figure I had seen it in, <i>viz.</i> an <i>Eye</i>, the exact Image
of its Maker: 'Tis true, <i>it was darkened</i> by Ignorance, Folly
and Crime, and therefore oblig'd <i>to wear Spectacles</i>; but
tho' these were Defects or Interruptions in its Operation, they
were none in its Nature; which as it had its immediate Efflux from
<i>the Great Eye</i>, and its return to him must partake of
himself, and could not but be of a Quality <i>uncomatable</i>, by
Casualty or Death.</p>

<p>From this Discourse we the more willingly adjourned our present
Thoughts, <i>I being clearly convinced of the Matter</i>; and as
for our Learned Doctors, with their Second and Third
<i>Thoughts</i>, I told him I would recommend them <i>to the Man in
the</i> Moon for their farther Illumination, which if they refuse
to accept, it was but just they should remain <i>in a Wood</i>,
where <i>they are</i>, and are <i>like to be</i>, puzzling
themselves about Demonstrations, squaring of Circles, and
converting <i>oblique</i> into <i>right Angles</i>, to bring out a
Mathematical <i>Clock-Work Soul</i>, that will go till the
<i>Weight is down</i>, and then stand still till <i>they know not
who</i> must wind it up again.</p>

<p>However, I cannot pass over a very strange and extraordinary
piece of Art which this Old Gentleman inform'd me of, and that was
an Engine <i>to screw a Man into himself:</i> Perhaps our
Country-men may be at some Difficulty to comprehend these things by
my dull Description; and to such I cannot but recommend, a Journey
<i>in my Engine to the</i> Moon.</p>

<p>This <i>Machine</i> that I am speaking of, contains a multitude
of <i>strange Springs</i> and <i>Screws</i>, and a Man that puts
himself into it, is very insensibly carried into <i>vast
Speculations</i>, <i>Reflexions</i>, and <i>regular Debates with
himself:</i> They have a very hard Name for it in those Parts; but
if I were to give it an <i>English</i> Name, it should be call'd,
<i>The Cogitator</i>, or <i>the Chair of Reflection</i>.</p>

<p>And First, The Person that is seated here feels some pain in
passing some <i>Negative Springs</i>, that are wound up,
effectually to shut out all <i>Injecting, Disturbing</i> Thoughts;
and the better to prepare him for the Operation that is to follow,
and this is without doubt a very rational way; for when a Man can
<i>absolutely shut out all manner of thinking</i>, but what he is
upon, he shall think the more Intensly upon the one object before
him.</p>

<p>This Operation past, here are <i>certain Screws</i> that draw
<i>direct Lines</i> from every <i>Angle of the Engine to the Brain
of the Man</i>, and at the same time, other direct Lines to his
Eyes; at the other end of which Lines, there are Glasses which
convey or reflect the Objects the Person is desirous to <i>think
upon</i>.</p>

<p>Then the main Wheels are turn'd, which wind up according to
their several Offices; <i>this</i> the Memory, <i>that</i> the
Understanding; a <i>third</i> the Will, a <i>fourth</i> the
thinking Faculty; and these being put all into regular Motions,
pointed by direct Lines to their proper Objects, and perfectly
uninterrupted by the Intervention of Whimsy, Chimera, and a
Thousand fluttering <i>D&aelig;mons</i> that Gender in the Fancy,
but are effectually Lockt out as before, assist one another to
receive right Notions, and form just Ideas of the things they are
directed to, and from thence the Man is impower'd to make right
Conclusions, <i>to think and act like himself</i>, suitable to the
sublime Qualities his Soul was originally blest with.</p>

<p>There never was a Man went into one of these <i>thinking
Engines</i>, but he came wiser out than he was before; and I am
persuaded, it would be a more effectual Cure to our <i>Deism</i>,
<i>Atheism</i>, <i>Scepticism</i>, and all other <i>Scisms</i>,
than ever the <i>Italian</i>'s Engine, for Curing the Gout by
cutting off the Toe.</p>

<p>This is a most wonderful Engine, and performs admirably, and my
Author gave me extraordinary Accounts of the good Effects of it;
and I cannot but tell my Reader, That our Sublunar World suffers
Millions of Inconveniencies, for want of this thinking Engine: I
have had a great many Projects in my Head, how to bring our People
to regular thinking, but 'tis in vain without this Engin; and how
to get the Model of it I know not; how to screw up the Will, the
Understanding, and the rest of the Powers; how to bring the Eye,
the Thought, the Fancy, and the Memory, into Mathematical Order,
and obedient to Mechanick Operation; help <i>Boyl</i>,
<i>Norris</i>, <i>Newton</i>, <i>Manton</i>, <i>Hammond</i>,
<i>Tillotson</i>, and all the Learned Race, help <i>Phylosophy</i>,
<i>Divinity</i>, <i>Physicks</i>, <i>Oeconomicks</i>, all's in
vain, a Mechanick Chair of Reflection is the only Remedy that ever
I found in my Life for this Work.</p>

<p>As to the Effects of Mathematical thinking, what Volumes might
be writ of it will more easily appear, if we consider the wondrous
Usefulness of this Engine in all humane Affairs; as of <i>War</i>,
<i>Peace</i>, <i>Justice</i>, <i>Injuries</i>, <i>Passion</i>,
<i>Love</i>, <i>Marriage</i>, <i>Trade</i>, <i>Policy</i>, and
<i>Religion</i>.</p>

<p>When a Man has been screw'd into himself, and brought by this
Art to a Regularity of Thought, he never commits any Absurdity
after it; his Actions are squared by the same Lines, for Action is
but the Consequence of Thinking; and he that acts before he thinks,
sets humane Nature with the bottom upward.</p>

<p><i>M.</i> would never have made his Speech, nor the famous
<i>B----ly</i> wrote a Book, if ever they had been in this thinking
Engine: One would have never told us of Nations he never saw, nor
the other told us, he had seen a great many, and was never the
Wiser.</p>

<p><i>H.</i> had never ruin'd his Family to Marry Whore, Thief and
Beggar-Woman, in one Salliant Lady, after having been told so
honestly, and so often of it by the very Woman her self.</p>

<p>Our late unhappy Monarch had never trusted the <i>English</i>
Clergy, when they preacht up that Non-Resistance, which he must
needs see they could never Practice; had his Majesty been screw'd
up into this <i>Cogitator</i>, he had presently reflected, that it
was against Nature to expect they should stand still, and let him
tread upon them: That they should, whatever they had preacht or
pretended to, hold open their Throats to have them be cut, and tye
their own Hands from resisting the Lord's Anointed.</p>

<p>Had some of our Clergy been screw'd in this Engine, they had
never turned Martyrs for their Allegiance to the Late King, only
for the Lechery of having Dr. <i>S-------</i> in their Company.</p>

<p>Had our Merchants been manag'd in this Engine, they had never
trusted their <i>Turkey</i> Fleet with a famous Squadron, that took
a great deal of care to Convoy them safe into the Enemies
Hands.</p>

<p>Had some People been in this Engine, when they had made a
certain League in the World, in order to make amends for a better
made before, they would certainly have consider'd farther, before
they had embarkt with a Nation, that are neither fit to go abroad
nor stay at Home.</p>

<p>As for the Thinking practis'd in Noble Speeches, <i>Occasional
Bills</i>, Addressings about Prerogative, Convocation Disputes,
Turnings in and Turnings out at Ours, and all the Courts of
<i>Christendom</i>, I have nothing to say to it.</p>

<p>Had the Duke of <i>Bavaria</i> been in our Engine, he would
never have begun a Quarrel, which he knew all the Powers of
<i>Europe</i> were concern'd to suppress, and lay all other
Business down till it was done.</p>

<p>Had the Elector of <i>Saxony</i> past the Operation of this
Engine, he would never have beggar'd a Rich Electorate, to ruin a
beggar'd Crown, nor sold himself for a Kingdom hardly worth any
Man's taking: He would never have made himself less than he was, in
hopes of being really no greater; and stept down from a Protestant
Duke, and Imperial Elector, to be a Nominal Mock King with a shadow
of Power, and a Name without honour, Dignity or Strength.</p>

<p>Had Mons. <i>Tallard</i> been in our Engine, he would not only
not have attackt the Confederates when they past the Morass and
Rivulet in his Front, but not have attackt them at all, nor have
suffer'd them to have attackt him, it being his Business not to
have fought at all, but have linger'd out the War, till the Duke of
<i>Savoy</i> having been reduced, the Confederate Army must have
been forced to have divided themselves of course, in order to
defend their own.</p>

<p>Some that have been very forward to have us proceed <i>The
Shortest Way</i> with the <i>Scots</i>, may be said to stand in
great need of this Chair of Reflection, to find out a just Cause
for such a War, and to make a Neighbour-Nation making themselves
secure, a sufficient Reason for another Neighbour-Nation to fall
upon them: Our Engine would presently show it them in a clear
sight, by way of Paralel, that 'tis just with the fame Right as a
Man may break open a House, because the People bar and bolt the
Windows.</p>

<p>If some-body has chang'd Hands there from bad to worse, and
open'd instead of closing Differences in those Cases, the
<i>Cogitator</i> migyt have brought them, by more regular Thinking,
to have known that was not at all the Method of bringing the
<i>S---s</i> to Reason.</p>

<p>Our <i>Cogitator</i> would be a very necessary thing to show
some People, That Poverty and Weakness is not a sufficient Ground
to oppress a Nation, and their having but little Trade, cannot be a
sufficient Ground to equip Fleets to take away what they have.</p>

<p>I cannot deny, that I have often thought they have had something
of this Engine in our Neighbouring <i>Antient Kingdom</i>, since no
Man, however we pretend to be angry, but will own they are in the
right of it, as to themselves, to Vote and procure Bills for their
own Security, and not to do as others demand without
<i>Conditions</i> fit to be accepted: But of that by it self.</p>

<p>There are abundance of People in Our World, of all sorts and
Conditions, that stand in need of our thinking Engines, and <i>to
be screw'd into themselves a little</i>, that they might think as
directly as they speak absurdly: But of these also in a Class by it
self.</p>

<p>This Engine has a great deal of Philosophy in it; and
particularly, 'tis a wonderful Remedy against <i>Poreing</i>; and
as it was said of Mons. <i>Jurieu</i> at <i>Amsterdam</i>, that he
us'd to <i>lose himself in himself</i>; by the Assistance of this
piece of Regularity, a Man is most effectually secur'd against
<i>bewildring Thoughts</i>, and by direct thinking, he prevents all
manner of dangerous wandring, since nothing can come to more speedy
Conclusions, than that which in right Lines, points to the proper
Subject of Debate.</p>

<p>All sorts of <i>Confusion of Thoughts</i> are perfectly avoided
and prevented in this case, and a Man is never troubled with
<i>Spleen</i>, <i>Hyppo</i>, or <i>Mute Madness</i>, when once he
has been thus under the Operation of <i>the Screw:</i> It prevents
abundance of Capital Disasters in Men, in private Affairs; it
prevents <i>hasty Marriages</i>, <i>rash Vows</i>, <i>Duels</i>,
<i>Quarrels</i>, Suits at <i>Law</i>, and most sorts of
<i>Repentance</i>. In the State, it saves a Government from many
Inconveniences; it checks immoderate <i>Ambition</i>, stops
<i>Wars</i>, <i>Navies</i> and <i>Expeditions</i>; especially it
prevents Members making <i>long Speeches</i> when they have
<i>nothing to say</i>; it keeps back Rebellions, Insurrections,
Clashings of Houses, <i>Occasional Bills</i>, <i>Tacking</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It has a wonderful Property in our Affairs at Sea, and has
prevented many a <i>Bloody Fight</i>, in which a great many honest
Men might have lost their Lives that are now useful Fellows, and
help to Man and manage Her Majesty's Navy.</p>

<p>What if some People are apt to charge Cowardice upon some People
in those Cases? 'Tis plain <i>that</i> cannot be <i>it</i>, for he
that dare incur the Resentment of the <i>English</i> Mob, shows
more Courage than would be able to carry him through Forty
Sea-fights.</p>

<p>'Tis therefore for want of being in this Engine, that we censure
People, because they don't be knocking one another on the Head,
like the People at the <i>Bear-Garden</i>; where, if they do not
see the <i>Blood run about</i>, they always cry out, <i>A
Cheat</i>; and the poor Fellows are fain to cut one another, that
they may not be pull'd a pieces; where the Case is plain, they are
<i>bold for fear</i>, and pull up Courage enough to Fight, because
they are afraid of the People.</p>

<p>This Engine prevents all sorts of <i>Lunacies</i>,
<i>Love-Frenzies</i>, and <i>Melancholy-Madness</i>, for preserving
the Thought in right Lines to direct Objects, it is impossible any
<i>Deliriums</i>, <i>Whimsies</i>, or <i>fluttering Air</i> of
Ideas, can interrupt the Man, he can never be Mad; for which reason
I cannot but recommend it to my Lord <i>S---</i>, my Lord
<i>N---</i>, and my Lord <i>H-----</i>, as absolutely necesssary to
defend them from the State-Madness, which for some Ages has possest
their Families, and which runs too much in the Blood.</p>

<p>It is also an excellent Introduction to Thought, and therefore
very well adapted to those People whose peculiar Talent and Praise
is, That <i>they never think at all</i>. Of these, if his Grace of
<i>B---d</i> would please to accept Advice from the <i>Man in the
Moon</i>, it should be to put himself into this Engine, as a
Soveraign Cure to the known Disease call'd the <i>Thoughtless
Evil</i>.</p>

<p>But above all, it is an excellent Remedy, and very useful to a
sort of People, who are always <i>Travelling</i> in Thought, but
never <i>Deliver'd</i> into Action; who are so exceeding busy at
Thinking, they have no leisure for Action; of whom the late Poet
sung well to the purpose;</p>

<blockquote>---- <i>Some modern Coxcombs, who</i><br>
<i>Retire to Think, 'cause they have nought to do;</i><br>
<i>For Thoughts were giv'n for Actions Government,</i><br>
<i>Where Action ceases, Thought Impertinent:</i><br>
<i>The Sphere of Action is Life's Happiness,</i><br>
<i>And he that Thinks beyond, Thinks like an Ass.</i></blockquote>
<p align="right">Rochest. Poems, <i>p.</i> 9.</p>

<p>These Gentlemen would make excellent use of this Engine, for it
would teach 'em to dispatch one thing before they begin another;
and therefore is of singular use to honest <i>S----</i>, whose
peculiar it was, to be always beginning Projects, but never finish
any.</p>

<p>The Variety of this Engine, its Uses, and Improvements, are
Innumerable, and the Reader must not expect I can give any thing
like a perfect Description of it.</p>

<p>There are yet another sort of Machine, which I never obtained a
sight of, till the last Voyage I made to this Lunar Orb, and these
are called <i>Elevators:</i> The Mechanick Operations of these are
wonderful, and helpt by Fire; by which the Sences are raised to
<i>all the strange Extreames</i> we can imagine, and whereby the
Intelligent Soul is made to converse with its own Species, whether
embody'd or not.</p>

<p>Those that are rais'd to a due pitch in this wondrous Frame,
have a clear Prospect into the World of Spirits, and converse with
<i>Visions</i>, <i>Guardian-Angels</i>, <i>Spirits departed</i>,
and what not: And as this is a wonderful Knowledge, and not to be
obtained, but by the help of this Fire; so those that have try'd
the Experiment, give strange Accounts of <i>Sympathy</i>,
<i>Prexistence</i> of Souls, <i>Dreams</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>I confess, I always believ'd a converse of Spirits, and have
heard of some who have experienced so much of it, as they could
obtain upon <i>no Body else</i> to believe.</p>

<p>I never saw any reason to doubt the Existent State of the Spirit
before embody'd, any more than I did of its Immortality after it
shall be uncas'd, and the Scriptures saying, the Spirit returns to
God that gave it, implies <i>a coming from</i>, or how could it be
call'd <i>a return</i>.</p>

<p>Nor can I see a reason why Embodying a Spirit should altogether
Interrupt its Converse with the World of Spirits, from whence it
was taken; and to what else shall we ascribe <i>Guardian
Angels</i>, in which the Scripture is also plain; and from whence
come <i>Secret Notices</i>, Impulse of <i>Thought</i>, pressing
<i>Urgencies of Inclination</i>, to or from this or that altogether
Involuntary; but from some <i>waking kind Assistant wandring
Spirit</i>, which gives secret hints to its Fellow-Creature, of
some approaching Evil or Good, which it was not able to
foresee.</p>

<p><i>For Spirits without the helps of Voice converse</i>.</p>

<p>I know we have supplied much of this with <i>Enthusiasm</i> and
<i>conceited Revelation</i>; but the People of this World convince
us, that it may be all Natural, by obtaining it in a Mechanick way,
<i>viz.</i> by forming something suitable to the sublime Nature,
which working by Art, shall only rectify the more <i>vigorous
Particles</i> of the Soul, and work it up to <i>a suitable
Elevation</i>. This Engine is wholly applied to the Head, and Works
by Injection; the chief Influence being on what we call
<i>Fancy</i>, or Imagination, which by the heat of strong Ideas, is
fermented to a strange heighth, and is thus brought to see backward
and forward every way, beyond it self: By this a Man fancies
himself <i>in the Moon</i>, and realizes things there as
distinctly, as if he was actually talking to <i>my Old
Phylosopher</i>.</p>

<p>This indeed is an admirable Engine, 'tis compos'd of <i>an
Hundred Thousand</i> rational Consequences, <i>Five times the
number</i> of Conjectures, Supposes, and Probabilities, besides an
innumerable Company of fluttering Suggestions, and Injections,
which hover round the Imagination, and are all taken in as fast as
they can be Concocted and Digested there: These are form'd into
Ideas, and some of those so well put together, so exactly shap'd,
so well drest and set out by the Additional Fire of Fancy, that it
is no uncommon thing for the Person to be intirely deceived by
himself, not knowing <i>the brat of his own Begetting</i>, nor be
able to distinguish between Reality and Representation: From hence
we have some People talking to Images of their own forming, and
seeing more Devils and Spectres than ever appear'd: From hence we
have weaker Heads not able to bear the Operation, seeing imperfect
Visions, as of Horses and Men without Heads or Arms, <i>Light</i>
without <i>Fire</i>, hearing <i>Voices</i> without <i>Sound</i>,
and Noises without <i>Shapes</i>, as their own Fears or Fancies
broke the <i>Ph&aelig;nomena</i> before the intire Formation.</p>

<p>But the more Genuine and perfect Use of these vast Elevations of
the Fancy, which are perform'd, as I said, by the Mechanick
Operation of Innate Fire, is to guide Mankind to as much Fore-sight
of things, as either by Nature, or by the Aid of any thing
Extranatural, may be obtain'd; and by this exceeding Knowledge, a
Man shall forebode to himself approaching Evil or Good, so as to
avoid this, or be in the way of that; and what if I should say,
That the Notices of these things are not only frequent, but
constant, and require nothing of us, but to make use of this
<i>Elevator</i>, to keep our Eyes, our Ears, and our Fancies open
to the hints; and observe them;</p>

<p>You may suppose me, if you please, come by this time into those
Northern Kingdoms I mention'd before, where my Old Philosopher was
a Native, and not to trouble you with any of the needful
Observations, Learned Inscriptions, <i>&amp;c. on the way</i>,
according to the laudable practices of the Famous Mr.
<i>Br---mly</i>, 'tis sufficient to tell you I found there an
<i>Opulent</i>, <i>Populous</i>, <i>Potent</i> and <i>Terrible
People</i>.</p>

<p>I found them at War with one of the greatest Monarchs of the
<i>Lunar</i> World, and at the same time miserably rent and torn,
mangl'd and disorder'd among themselves.</p>

<p>As soon as I observ'd the Political posture of their Affairs,
(for here a Man sees things mighty soon by the helps of such a
Masterly Eye-sight as I have mention'd) and remembring what is said
for our Instruction, <i>That a Kingdom divided against its self
cannot stand</i>; I ask'd the Old Gentleman if he had <i>any
Estate</i> in that Country? He told me, no great matter; but ask'd
me why I put that Question to him? <i>Because</i>, said I, <i>if
this People go on fighting and snarling at all the World, and one
among another in this manner, they will certainly be Ruin'd and
Undone, either subdu'd by some more powerful Neighbour; whilst one
Party will stand still and see the t'others Throat cut, tho' their
own Turn immediately follows, or else they will destroy and devour
one another</i>. Therefore I told him I would have him Turn his
Estate into Money, and go some where else; or go back to the other
World with me.</p>

<p><i>No, no</i>, reply'd the Old Man, <i>I am in no such Fear at
this Time, the Scale of Affairs is very lately chang'd here</i>,
says he, <i>in but a very few Years</i>.</p>

<p><i>I know nothing of that</i>, said I, <i>but I am sure there
never was but one spot of Ground in that World which I came from,
that was divided like them, and that's that very Country I liv'd
in. Here are three Kingdoms of you in one spot</i>, said I, One
<i>has already been</i> Conquer'd and Subdu'd, the t'other
<i>suppres'd its Native lnhabitants</i>, and planted it with her
own, and now carries it with so high a Hand over them of her own
Breed, that <i>she limits their Trade, stops their Ports, when the
Inhabitants have made their Manufactures, these wont give them
leave to send them abroad, impose Laws upon them, refuse to alter
and amend those they would make for themselves, make them pay
Customs</i>, Excises, <i>and</i> Taxes, <i>and yet</i> pay the
Garrisons and Guards <i>that defend them, themselves; Press their
Inhabitants to their Fleets, and carry away their Old Veteran
Troops that should defend them, and leave them to raise more to be
serv'd in the same manner, will let none of their Mony be carry'd
over thither, nor let them Coin any of their own</i>; and a great
many such hardships they suffer under the Hand of this Nation <i>as
meer Slaves</i> and <i>Conquer'd People, tho' the greatest part of
the Traders are the People of the very Nation that treats 'em
thus</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this creates Eternal Murmurs, Heart-burnings
and Regret, both in the Natives and the Transplanted Inhabitants;
the first have shewn their Uneasiness by frequent Insurrections and
Rebellions, for Nature prompts the meanest Animal to struggle for
Liberty; and these struggles have often been attended with great
Cruelty, Ravages, Death, Massacres, and Ruin both of Families and
the Country it self: As to the Transplanted Inhabitants, they run
into Clandestine Trade, into corresponding with their Masters
Enemies, <i>Victualling their Navies</i>, Colonies and the like,
receiving and importing their Goods in spight of all the Orders and
Directions to the contrary.</p>

<p>These are the effects of Divisions, and Feuds on that side; on
the other hand there is a Kingdom <i>Entire</i> Unconquer'd and
<i>Independent</i>, and for the present, under the same Monarch
with the rest.---- But here their Feuds are greater than with the
other, and <i>more dangerous by far</i> because National: This
Kingdom joins to the North part of the first Kingdom, and Terrible
Divisions ly among the two Nations.</p>

<p>The People of these two Kingdoms are call'd if you please for
distinction sake, for I cannot well make you understand their hard
Names, <i>Solunarians</i> and <i>Nolunarians</i>, these to the
<i>South</i> and those to the <i>North</i>, the <i>Solunarians</i>
were divided in their Articles of Religion; the Governing Party, or
the Establish'd Church, I shall call the <i>Solunarian</i> Church;
but the whole Kingdom was full of a sort of Religious People call'd
<i>Crolians</i>, who like our Dissenters in <i>England</i> profess
divers sub-divided Opinions by themselves, and cou'd not, or wou'd
not, let it go which way it will, joyn with the Establish'd
Church.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Establish'd Church in the Northern
Kingdom was all <i>Crolians</i>, but full of <i>Solunarians</i> in
Opinions, who were Dissenters there, as the <i>Crolians</i> were
Dissenters in the South, and this unhappy mixture occasion'd
endless Feuds, Divisions, Sub-divisions and Animosities without
Number, of which hereafter.</p>

<p>The Northern Men are Bold, Terrible Numerous and <i>Brave</i>,
to the last Degree, but Poor, and by the Encroachments of their
Neighbours, growing poorer every Day.</p>

<p>The Southern are equally Brave, more Numerous and Terrible, but
Wealthy and <i>care not for Wars</i>, had rather stay at Home and
Quarrel with one another, than go Abroad to Fight, making good an
Old Maxim, <i>Too Poor t'Agree, and yet too Rich to Fight</i>.</p>

<p>Between these the Feud is great, and every Day growing greater;
and those People who pretend to have been in the <i>Cogitator</i>
or <i>thinking Engine</i> tell us, all the lines of Consequences in
that Affair point at a fatal period between the Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The Complaints also are great, and back'd with fiery Arguments
on both sides; the Northern Men say, the <i>Solunarians</i> have
dealt unjustly and unkindly by them in several Articles; but the
Southern Men reply with a most powerful Argument, <i>viz.</i> they
are <i>Poor</i>, and therefore ought to be Oppress'd, Suppress'd,
or <i>any thing</i>.</p>

<p>But the main Debate is like to lye upon the Article of Choosing
<i>a King</i>; both the Nations being under one Government at
present, but the Settlement ending in the Reigning Line, the
Northern Men refuse to joyn in Government again, unless they have a
rectification of some Conditions in which, they say, they have the
worst of it.</p>

<p>In this case, even the Southern Men themselves, say, they
believe the <i>Nolunarians</i> have been in the <i>Chair of
Reflection</i>, the <i>thinking Engine</i>, and that having screw'd
their Understandings into a Direct Position to that Matter before
them, they have made a right Judgment of their own Affairs, and
<i>with all their Poverty</i> stand on the best Foot <i>as to
Right</i>.</p>

<p>But as the matter of this Northern Quarrel comes under a Second
Head, and is more properly the Subject of a Second Voyage to the
<i>Moon</i>; the Reader may have it more at large consider'd in
another Class, and some farther Enlightnings in that Affair than
perhaps can be reasonably expected of me here.</p>

<p>But of all the Feuds and Brangles that ever poor Nation was
embroild in, of all the Quarrels, the Factions and Parties that
ever the People of any Nation thought worth while to fall out for,
none were ever in <i>reality</i> so light, in <i>effect</i> so
heavy, in <i>appearance</i> so great, in <i>substance</i> so small,
in <i>name</i> so terrible, in <i>nature</i> so trifling, as those
for which this Southern Country was altogether by the Ears among
themselves.</p>

<p>And this was one Reason why I so earnestly enquir'd of my
<i>Lunarian Philosopher</i>, whether he had an Estate in that
Country or no. But having told him the Cause of that enquiry, he
reply'd, there was one thing in the Nature of his Country-men which
secur'd them from the ruin which usually attended <i>divided
Nations</i>, <i>viz.</i> that if any Foreign Nation thinking to
take the advantage of their Intestine Divisions <i>fell upon
them</i> in the highest of all their Feuds, they'd lay aside their
Parties and Quarrels and presently <i>fall in together</i> to beat
out the common Enemy; and then no sooner had they obtain'd <i>Peace
abroad</i>, by their Conduct and Bravery, but they would fall to
cutting one anothers Throats again at home <i>as naturally</i> as
if it had been their proper Calling, and that for Trifles too,
<i>meer Trifles</i>.</p>

<p>Very well, said I to <i>my learned Self</i>, pretty like my own
Country still, that whatever Peace they have <i>abroad</i>, are
sure to have none <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>To come at the historical Account of these <i>Lunarian</i>
Dissentions, it will be absolutely necessary to enter a little into
the Story of <i>the Place</i>, at least as far as relates to the
present Constitution, both of the People, the Government, and the
Subject of their present Quarrels.</p>

<p>And first we are to understand, that there has for some Ages
been carry'd on in these Countries, a private feud or quarrel among
the People, about a thing call'd by them <i>Upogyla</i>, with us
very vulgarly call'd <i>Religion</i>.</p>

<p>This Difference, as in its Original it was not great, nor indeed
upon Points accounted among themselves Essential, so it had never
been a Difference of any height, if there had not always been some
one thing, or other, hapning in the State which made the
Court-Polititians think it necessary to keep the People busy and
embroil'd, to prevent their more narrow Inspection into
Depredations and Encroachments on their Liberties, which was always
making on them by the Court.</p>

<p>'Tis not deny'd but there might be a Native want of Charity in
the Inhabitant, adapting them to Feud, and particularly qualifying
them to be alwavs Piquing one another; and some of their own
Nation, who by the help of the famous Perspectives
before-mentioned, pretend to have seen farther into the Insides of
Nature and Constitution than other People, tell us the cross Lines
of Nature which appear in the make of those particular People,
signify a direct <i>Negative</i> as to the Article of
<i>Charity</i> and good Neighbour-hood.</p>

<p>'Twas particularly unhappy to this wrangling People, that
Reasons of State should always fall in, to make that
uncharitableness and continual quarrelling Humour necessary to
carry on the Publick Affairs of the Nation, and may pass for a
certain Proof, that the State was under some Diseases and
Convulsions, which, like a Body that digests nothing so well as
what is hurtful to its Constitution, makes use of those things for
its Support, which are in their very Nature, fatal to its being,
and must at last tend to its Destruction.</p>

<p>But as this however enclin'd them to be continually
<i>Snarling</i> at one another, so as in all Quarrels it generally
appears one Side must go down.</p>

<p>The prevailing Party therefore always kept the Power in their
Hands, and as the <i>under</i> were always Subject to the lash they
soon took care to hook their Quarrel into the Affairs of State, and
so join <i>Religious</i> Differences, and <i>Civil</i> Differences
together.</p>

<p>These things had long embroil'd the Nation, and frequently
involv'd them in bitter Enmities, Feuds, and Quarrels, and once in
a tedious, ruinous, and bloody War in their own Bowels, in which,
contrary to all expectation, this <i>lesser Party</i>
prevail'd.</p>

<p>And since the allegorick Relation may bear great Similitude with
our European Affairs on this side <i>the Moon:</i> I shall for the
ease of Expression, and the better Understanding of the Reader,
frequently call them by the same Names our unhappy Parties are
call'd by in <i>England</i>, as <i>Solunnarian Churchmen</i>, and
<i>Crolian Dissenters</i>, at the same time desiring my Reader to
observe, that he is <i>always to remember</i> who it is we are
talking of, and that he is <i>by no means</i> to understand me of
any Person, Party, People, Nation, or Place on this side the Moon,
any Expression, Circumstance, Similitude, or Appearance <i>to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding</i>.</p>

<p>This premis'd, I am to tell the Reader that the last Civil War
in this <i>Lunar</i> Country ended in the Victors confounding their
own Conquests by their intestine Broils, they being as is already
noted a most Eternally Quarrelling Nation; upon this new Breach,
they that first began the War, turn'd about, and pleading that they
took up Arms to regulate the Government, not to overthrow it, fell
in with the Family of their Kings, who had been banish'd, <i>and
one of them destroy'd</i>, and restor'd the Crown to the Family,
and the Nation to the Crown, just <i>for all the World</i> as the
<i>Presbyterians</i> in <i>England</i> did, in the Case of King
<i>Charles</i> the Second.</p>

<p>The Party that was thus restor'd, accepted the return the others
made to their Duty, and their Assistance in restoring the Family of
their Monarch, but abated not a Tittle of the old Rancour against
them <i>as a Party</i> which they entertain'd at their first taking
Arms, not allowing the return they had made to be <i>any attonement
at all</i> for the Crimes they had been guilty of before. 'Tis true
they pass'd an Act or Grant of <i>General Pardon</i>, and Oblivion,
as in all such Cases is usual, and as without which the other would
never ha' come in, or have join'd Powers to form the Restoration
they were bringing to pass, but the old Feud of Religion continu'd
with this addition, that the <i>Dissenters</i> were <i>Rebels</i>,
<i>Murtherers</i>, <i>King-killers</i>, Enemies to <i>Monarchy</i>
and Civil Government, lovers of Confusion, popular, anarchial
Governments, and movers of Sedition; that this was in their very
<i>Nature</i> and <i>Principles</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>In this Condition, and under these Mortifications this Party of
People liv'd just an <i>Egyptian</i> Servitude, <i>viz.</i> of 40
Years, in which time they were frequently vex'd with Persecution,
<i>Harass'd</i>, Plunder'd, <i>Fin'd</i>, Imprisoned, and very
hardly Treated, insomuch that they pretend to be able to give an
account of vast Sums of their Country-Mony, levy'd upon them on
these Occasions, amounting as I take it to 2 Millions of
<i>Lunatians</i>, a Coin they keep their Accounts by there, and
much about the value of our Pound Sterling; besides this they were
hook't into a great many Sham Plots, and Sworn out of their
<i>Lives</i> and <i>Estates</i> in such a manner, that in the very
next Reign the Government was so sensible of their hard treatment,
that they revers'd several Sentences by the same Authority that had
Executed them; a most undeniable Proof they were asham'd of what
had been done; at last, the Prince who was restor'd as abovesaid,
dyed, and his Brother mounted the Throne; and now began <i>a third
Scene</i> of Affairs, for this Prince was neither
<i>Church-man</i>, nor <i>Dissenter</i>, but of a different
Religion from them all, known in that Country by the Name of
<i>Abrogratzianism</i>, and this Religion of his had this one
absolutely necessary Consequence in it, that a Man could not be
sincerely and heartily of this, but he must be an Implacable hater
of both the other. As this is laid down as a previous Supposition,
we are with the same Reason to imagine this Prince to be entirely
bent upon the Suppression and Destruction of both the other, if not
<i>absolutely</i> as to Life and Estate, yet <i>entirely</i> as to
Religion.</p>

<p>To bring this the more readily to pass like a true Polititian,
had his Methods and Particulars been equally Politick with his
Generals, he began at the right End, <i>viz.</i> to make the Breach
between the <i>Solunnarian Church</i>, and the <i>Crolian
Dissenters</i> as wide as possible, and to do this it was resolv'd
to shift Sides, and as the Crown had always took part with the
Church, crush'd, humbl'd, persecuted, and by all means possible
mortify'd the Dissenters, as is noted in the Reign of his
Predecessor. This Prince resolv'd to caress, cherish, and encourage
the <i>Crolians</i> by all possible Arts and outward Endearments,
not so much that they purpos'd them any real Favour, <i>for the
destruction of both was equally determin'd</i>, nor so much that
they expected to draw them over to <i>Abrogratzianism</i>, but Two
Reasons may be suppos'd to give Rise to this Project.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Lunarian Church</i>
Party had all along Preach'd up for a part of their Religion, that
<i>Absolute undisputed Obedience</i>, was due from every Subject to
their Prince without any <i>Reserve</i>, Reluctance or
<i>Repining</i>; that as to Resistance, it was Fatal to
<i>Body</i>, <i>Soul</i>, <i>Religion</i>, <i>Justice</i> and
<i>Government</i>; and tho' the Doctrine was Repugnant to
<i>Nature</i>, and to the very Supreme Command it self, yet he that
resisted, receiv'd to himself Damnation, just <i>for all the
World</i> like our Doctrine of <i>Passive Obedience</i>. Now tho'
these <i>Solunarian</i> Church-Men did not absolutely believe all
they said themselves to be true, yet they found it necessary to
push these things to the uttermost Extremities, because they might
the better fix upon the <i>Crolian Dissenters</i>, the Charge of
professing less Loyal Principles than they. For as to the
<i>Crolians</i>, they profess'd openly they would pay Obedience to
the Prince, as far as the Laws directed, <i>but no farther</i>.</p>

<p>These things were run up to strange heights, and the People were
always falling out about what they would do, or wou'd not do, if
things were <i>so or so</i>, as they were not, and <i>were never
likely to be</i>; and the hot Men on both sides were every now and
then going together by the Ears about <i>Chimeras</i>, Shadows,
<i>May-be's</i> and <i>Supposes</i>.</p>

<p>The hot Men of the <i>Solunarian Church</i> were for knocking
the <i>Crolians</i> in the Head, because as they said they were
<i>Rebels</i>, their <i>Fathers</i> were Rebels, and they would
certainly turn Rebels again upon occasion.</p>

<p>The <i>Crolians</i> insisted upon it, that they had nothing to
do with what was done before they were Born, that if they were
Criminal, because their Fathers were so, then a great many who were
now of the <i>Solunarian Church</i> were as Guilty as they, several
of the best Members of that Church having been Born of
<i>Crolian</i> Parents.</p>

<p>In the matter of Loyalty they insisted upon it, they were as
Loyal as the <i>Solunarians</i>, for that they were as Loyal as
Nature, Reason and the Laws both of God and Man requir'd, and what
the Other talk'd of <i>more</i>, was but a meer pretence, and so it
would be found if ever their Prince should have occasion to put
them to the Tryal, that he that pretended to go beyond the Power of
Nature and Reason, <i>must indeed go beyond them</i>, and they
never desir'd to be brought into the extream, but they were ready
at any time to shew such Proofs, and give such Demonstrations of
their Loyalty, as would satisfy any reasonable Prince, and <i>for
more they had nothing to say</i>.</p>

<p>In this posture of Affairs, this new Prince found his Subjects
when he came to the Crown, the <i>Solunarian Church</i> Caress'd
him, and notwithstanding his being Devoted to the <i>Abrogratzian
Faith</i>, they Crown'd him with extraordinary Acclamations.</p>

<p>They were the rather enclin'd to push this forward by how much
they thought it would singularly mortify the <i>Crolians</i>, and
all the sorts of <i>Dissenters</i>, for they had all along declar'd
their abhorrence of the <i>Abrogratzians</i> to such a Degree that
they publickly endeavour'd to have got a general Concurrence of the
whole Nation in the Publick <i>Cortez</i>, or <i>Dyet</i> of the
Kingdom, to have joyn'd with them in Excluding this very Prince by
Name, and all other Princes that should ever embrace the
<i>Abrogratzian</i> Faith.</p>

<p>And it wanted but a very little of bringing it to pass, for
almost all the Great Men of the Nation, tho' <i>Solunarians</i>,
yet that were Men of <i>Temper</i>, Moderation, and
<i>Fore-sight</i>, were for this exclusive Law. But the <i>High
Priests</i> and <i>Patriarchs</i> of the <i>Solunarian Church</i>
prevented it, and upon pretence of this <i>Passive Obedience
Principle</i>, made their Interest and gave their Voices for
Crowning, or Entailing the Crown and Government on the Head of one
of the most Implacable Enemies both to their Religion and Civil
Right that ever the Nation saw; <i>but they liv'd to Repent it too
late</i>.</p>

<p>This Conquest over the <i>Crolians</i> and the <i>Moderate
Solunarians</i>, if it did not suppress them entirely, it yet gave
the other Part such an ascendant over them, that they made no Doubt
when that Prince came to the Crown, they had done so much to oblige
him, that he could deny them nothing, and therefore in expectation
they swallow'd up the whole Body of the <i>Crolians</i> at once,
and began to talk of nothing less than Banishing them to the
Northern part of the Country, or to certain Islands, and Countries
a vast way off, where formerly great numbers of them had fled for
shelter in like Cases.</p>

<p>And this was the more probable by an unhappy Stroke these
<i>Crolians</i> attempted to strike, <i>but miscarry'd</i> in at
the very beginning of this Prince's Reign: for as they had always
profest an aversion to this Prince on account of his Religion, as
soon as their other King was dead, they set up one of his Natural
Sons against this King, which the <i>Solunarians</i> had so
joyfully Crown'd. This young Prince invaded his Dominions, and
great Numbers of the most zealous <i>Crolians</i> joyn'd him----
But to cut the Story short, he was entirely routed by the Forces of
the new Prince, for all the <i>Solunarian Church</i> joyn'd with
him against the <i>Crolians</i> without any respect to the Interest
of Religion, so they overthrew their Brethren: The young invaded
Prince was taken and put to Death openly, and <i>Great
Cruelties</i> were exercis'd in cold Blood upon the poor unhappy
People that were taken in the Defeat!</p>

<p>Thus a second time these Loyal <i>Solunarian Church-men</i>
Establish'd their Enemy, and built up what they were glad
afterwards to pull down again, and to beg the assistance of those
<i>Crolians</i> whom they had so rudely handled, to help them
demolish the Power they had erected themselves, and which now began
to set its foot upon the Throat of those that nourish'd and
supported it.</p>

<p>Upon this exceeding Loyalty and blind Assistance given to their
Prince, the <i>Solunarians</i> made no question but they had so
Eternally bound him to them, that it would be in their Power to
pull down the very Name of <i>Crolianism</i>, and utterly destroy
it from the Nation.</p>

<p>But the time came on to Undeceive them, for this Prince, whose
Principle as an <i>Abrogratzian</i>, was to destroy them both, as
it happened, was furnish'd with Counsellors and Ecclesiasticks of
his own Profession, ten thousand Times more bent for their general
Ruin, than himself.</p>

<p>For abstracted from the Venom and Rancour of his Profession as
an <i>Abrogratzian</i>, and from the furious Zeal of his
<i>Bramin</i>, Priests, and Religious People, that continually hung
about him, and that prompted him to act against his Temper and
Inclination, by which he ruin'd all, he was else a <i>forward</i>
and <i>generous</i> Prince, and likely to have made his People
Great and Flourishing.</p>

<p>But his <i>furious Church-Men</i> ruin'd all his good Designs,
and turn'd all his Projects to compass the Introduction of his own
Religion into his Dominions.</p>

<p>Nay, and had he not fatally been push'd on by such as really
design'd his Ruin, to drive this deep Design on too hastily and
turn the Scale of his Management from a close and conceal'd, to an
open and profess'd Design, he might have gone a great way with
it.--------- Had he been content to have let that have been twenty
Year a doing, which he impatiently as well as preposterously
attempted all at once.------- <i>Wise Men have thought</i> he might
in time have supprest the <i>Solunarian Religion</i>, and have set
up his own.</p>

<p>To give a short Scheme of his Proceedings, and with them of the
reason of his Miscarriage.</p>

<p>1. Having defeated the Rebellious
<i>Crolians</i>, as is before noted, and reflecting on the Danger
he was in upon the sudden Progress of that Rebellion, for indeed he
was within a trifle of Ruin in that Affair; and had not the
<i>Crolians</i> been deceiv'd by the darkness of the Night and led
to a large Ditch of Water, which they could not pass over, they had
certainly surpriz'd and overthrown his Army, and cut them in
pieces, before they had known who had hurt them. Upon the Sense of
this Danger, he takes up a pretence of necessity for the being
always ready to resist <i>the Factious Crolians</i>, as he call'd
them, and by that Insinuation hooks himself into a <i>standing Army
in time of Peace</i>; ----- nay, and so easy were the <i>Solunarian
Church</i> to yield up any point, which they did but imagin would
help to crush their Brethren the <i>Crolians</i>, that they not
only consented to this unusual Invasion of their antient Liberties,
but sent up several <i>Testimonials</i> of their free Consent, nay,
and of their Joy of having arriv'd to so great a Happiness, as to
have a Prince that <i>setting aside the formality of Laws</i> would
vouchsafe to Govern them by the glorious Method of a <i>Standing
Army</i>.------</p>

<p>These <i>Testimonials</i> were things not much unlike <i>our
Addresses</i> in <i>England</i>, and which when I heard I could not
but remember our Case, in the time of the late King <i>James</i>,
when the City of <i>Carlisle</i> in their Address, <i>Thankt his
Majesty</i> for the Establishing a Standing Army in <i>England</i>
in time of Peace, calling it the <i>Strength, and Glory</i> of the
Kingdom.</p>

<p>So strong is the Ambition and Envy of Parties, these
<i>Solunarian Gentlemen</i> not grudging to put out one of their
own eyes, so they might at the same time put out both the Eyes of
their Enemies; the <i>Crolians</i> rather consented to this badge
of their own Slavery, and brought themselves who were a free People
before, under the Power and Slavery of the Sword.</p>

<p>The ease with which this Prince got over so considerable a Point
as this, made him begin to be too credulous and to perswade himself
that the <i>Solunarian Church-Men</i> were really in earnest, as to
their Pageant-Doctrin of <i>Non-Resistance</i>, and that as he had
seen them bear with strange extravagancies on the <i>Crolian</i>
Part, they were real and in earnest when they Preach'd that Men
ought to obey for Conscience's sake, whatever hardship were impos'd
upon them, and however unjust, or contrary to the Laws of God,
Nature, Reason, or their Country; what Principle in the World could
more readily prompt a Prince to attempt what he so earnestly
coveted, as this zealous Prince did the restoring the
<i>Abrogratzian</i> Faith, for since he had but two sorts of People
to do with; one he had crush'd by force, and had brought the other
to profess it their <i>Religion</i>, their <i>Duty</i>, and their
<i>Resolution</i> to bear every thing he thought fit to Impose upon
them, and that they should be <i>Damn'd</i> if they
<i>resisted</i>, the Work seem'd half done to his Hand.</p>

<p>And indeed when I reflected on the Coherence of things, I could
not so much blame this Prince for his venturing upon the
probability, for whoever was but to go up to this <i>Lunar
World</i> and read the Stories of that Time, with what Fury the hot
Men of the <i>Solunarian Church</i> acted against the <i>Dissenting
Crolians</i>, and with what warmth they assisted their Prince
against them, and how Cruelly they insulted them after they were
defeated in their attempt of Dethroning him, how zealously they
Preach'd up the Doctrine of absolute undisputed Resignation to his
Will, how frequently they obey'd several of his encroachments upon
their Liberties, and what solemn Protestations they made to submit
to him in any thing, and to stand by and assist him in
<i>whatever</i> he Commanded them to the <i>last Drop</i>, much
with the same Zeal and Forwardness, as our <i>Life-and-Fortune
Men</i> did here in <i>England</i>. I say, when all this was
consider'd, I could not so much condemn his Credulity, nor blame
him for believing them, for no Man could have doubted their
Sincerity, but he that at the same time must have Taxt them with
<i>most unexampled Hipocrisie</i>.</p>

<p>For the <i>Solunarians</i> now began to discern their Prince was
not really on their side, that neither in State Matters any more
than Religion, he had any affection for them, and the first
absolute Shock he gave them, was in Publishing a general Liberty to
the <i>Crolians</i>. 'Tis true this was not out of respect to the
<i>Crolian</i> Religion any more than the <i>Solunarian</i>, but
purely because by that means he made way for an Introduction of the
<i>Abrogratzian</i> Religion which now began to appear publickly in
the Country.</p>

<p>But however, as this was directly contrary to the expectation of
the <i>Solunarians</i>, it gave them such a disgust against their
Prince, that from that very time being disappointed in the
Soveraign Authority they expected, they entred into the deepest and
blackest Conspiracy against their Prince and his Government that
ever was heard of.</p>

<p>Many of the <i>Crolians</i> were deluded by the new Favour and
Liberty they receiv'd from the Prince to believe him real, and were
glad of the Mortification of their Brethren; but the more Judicious
seeing plainly the Prince's Design, <i>declar'd against their own
Liberty</i>, because given them by an illegal Authority, without
the assent of the whole Body legally assembled.</p>

<p>When the <i>Solunarians</i> saw this they easily reconcil'd
themselves to the <i>Crolians</i>, at least from the Outside of the
Face, for the carrying on their Design, and so here was a Nation
full of Plots, here was the Prince and his <i>Abrogratzians</i>
plotting to introduce their Religion, here was a parcel of blind
short-sighted <i>Crolians</i> plotting to ruin the <i>Solunarian
Establishment</i>, and weakly joining with the <i>Abrogratzians</i>
to satisfy their private Resentments; and here was the <i>wiser
Crolians</i> joining heartily with the <i>Solunarians</i> of all
sorts, laying aside private Resentments, and forgetting old Grudges
about Religion, in order to ruin the invading Projects of the
Prince and his Party.</p>

<p>There was indeed some verbal Conditions past between them, and
the <i>Solunarians</i> willing to bring them into their Party
promised them upon the Faith of their Nation, and the Honour of the
<i>Solunarian Religion</i>, that there should be no more Hatred,
Disturbance <i>or Persecution</i> for the sake of Religion between
them, but that they would come to a Temper with them, and always be
Brethren for the future. They declared that <i>Persecution ran
contrary to their Religion in general, and to their Doctrin in
particular</i>; and backt their Allegations with some Truths they
have not since thought fit <i>to like</i>, nor much <i>to
regard</i>.</p>

<p>However by this Artifice, and on these Conditions, they brought
the <i>Crolians</i> to join with them in their Resolutions to
countermine their designing Prince; these indeed were for doing it
by the old way down-right, and to oppose Oppression with Force, a
Doctrin they acknowledg'd, and profest to join with all the
<i>Lunar</i> part of Mankind in the practice, and began to tell
their Brethren how they had impos'd upon themselves and the World,
in pretending to absolute Submission against Nature and
<i>universal Lunarian Practice</i>.</p>

<p>But a cunning Fellow personating a <i>Solunarian</i>, and who
was in the Plot, <i>gravely answer'd them thus</i>,</p>

<blockquote>'Look ye, Gentlemen, we own with you
that <i>Nature</i>, <i>Reason</i>, <i>Law</i>, <i>Justice</i>, and
<i>Custom of Nations</i> is on your side, and that all Power
<i>Derives</i> from, <i>Centers</i> in, and on all Recesses or
Demises of Power <i>returns</i> to its Great Original the <i>Party
Governed:</i> Nay we own our <i>Great Eye</i> from whom all the
habitable Parts of this Globe are inlightned, has always directed
us to practice what Nature thus dictates, always approv'd and
generally succeeded the attempt of Dethroning Tyrants. But our Case
differs, <i>we have always pretended to this absolute undisputed
Obedience</i>, which we did indeed to gain the Power of your Party;
and if we should turn round at once to your Opinion, tho' never so
right, we should so fly in the Face of our own Doctrin,
<i>Sermons</i>, innumerable <i>Pamphlets</i> and
<i>Pretensions</i>, as would give all our Enemies too great a Power
over us in Argument, and we should never be able to look Mankind in
the Face: But we have laid our Measures so that by prompting the
King to <i>run upon us</i> in all sorts of bare-fac'd Extreams and
Violences, we shall bring him to exasperate the whole Nation; then
we may underhand foment the breach on this side, raise the Mob upon
him, and by acting on both sides seem to suffer a Force in falling
in with the People, and preserve our Reputation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Thus we shall bring the thing to pass,
<i>betray our Prince</i>, take Arms <i>against his Power</i>, call
in <i>Foreign Force</i> to do the Work, and even then keep our
Hands seemingly out of the Broil, by being pretended Sticklers for
our former Prince; so save our Reputation, and bring all to pass
with Ease and Calmness; while the eager Party of the
<i>Abrogratzians</i> will do their own Work by expecting we will do
it for them.</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Crolians</i> astonish'd both at the Policy, the Depth,
the Knavery and the Hypocrisy of the Design, left them to carry it
on, owning it was a Masterpiece of Craft, and so stood still to
observe the Issue, which every way answer'd the exactness of its
Contrivance.</p>

<p>When I saw into the bottom of all this Deceit, I began to take
up new Resolutions of returning back into <i>our Old World
again</i>, and going home to <i>England</i>, where tho' I had
conceiv'd great Indignation at the Treatment our <i>Passive
Obedience Men</i> gave their Prince here, and was in hopes in these
my remote Travels to have found out some Nations of Honour and
Principles. I was fill'd with Amazement to see our <i>Moderate
Knaves</i> so much <i>out-done</i>, and I was inform'd that all
these things were meer Amusements, Vizors, and Shams, to bring an
Innocent Prince into the Snare.</p>

<p>Would any Mortal imagin who has read this short Part of the
Story, that all this was <i>a Solunarian Church Plot</i>, a meer
Conspiracy between these Gentlemen and the <i>Crolian
Dissenters</i>, only to wheedle in the unhappy Prince to his own
Destruction, and bring the popular Advantage of the Mob, to a
greater Ascendant on the Crown.</p>

<p>Of all the <i>Richlieus</i>, <i>Mazarines</i>,
<i>Gondamours</i>, <i>Oliver Cromwels</i>, and the whole Train of
Polititians that our World has produc'd, the greatest of their Arts
are Follies to the unfathomable depth of these <i>Lunarian
Policies</i>; and for <i>Wheedle</i>, <i>Lying</i>,
<i>Swearing</i>, <i>Preaching</i>, <i>Printing</i>, &amp;c. what is
said in our World by <i>Priests</i> and <i>Polititans</i>, we thank
God <i>may be believ'd</i>; but if ever I believe a <i>Solunarian
Priest</i> Preaching Non-Resistance of Monarchs, or a <i>Solunarian
Polititian</i> turning <i>Abrogratzian</i>, I ought to be mark'd
down for a Fool; nor will ever any Prince in that Country take
their Word again, if ever they have their Senses about 'em, but as
this is a most extraordinary Scene, so I cannot omit a more
particular and sufficient Relation of some Parts of it, than I us'd
to give.</p>

<p>The <i>Solunarian Clergy</i> had carry'd on their Non-Resistance
Doctrin to such Extremities, and had given this new Prince such
unusual demonstrations of it, that he fell absolutely <i>into the
Snare</i>, and entirely believ'd them; he had try'd them with such
Impositions as they would never have born from any Prince in the
World, nor from him neither, had they not had a deep Design, and
consequently stood in need of the deepest Disguise imaginable; they
had yielded to a <i>Standing Army</i>, and applauded it as a thing
they had desir'd; they had submitted to <i>levying Taxes</i> upon
them by <i>New Methods</i>, and illegal Practices; they had yielded
to the abrogation or suspension at least of their Laws, when the
King's absolute Will requir'd it; not that they were blind, and did
not see what their Prince was doing, but that the black Design was
so deeply laid, they found it was the only way to ruin him, to push
him upon the highest Extreams, and then they should have their turn
serv'd.---- Thus if he desir'd one illegal Thing of them, they
would immediately grant two; one would have thought they had read
our Bible, <i>and the Command, when a Man takes away the Cloak, to
give him the Coat also</i>.</p>

<p>Nor was this enough, but they seem'd willing to admit of the
publick Exercise of the <i>Abrogratzian</i> Religion in all Parts;
and when the Prince set it up in his own Chappel, they suffered it
to be set up in their Cities, and Towns, and the <i>Abrogratzian
Clergy</i> began to be seen up and down in their very Habits; a
thing which had never been permitted before in that Country, and
which the Common People began to be very uneasy at. But still the
<i>Solunarian Clergy</i>, and all such of the Gentry, especially as
were in the Plot, by their Sermons, printed Books, and publick
Discourses, carry'd on this high topping Notion of absolute
Submission, so that the People were kept under, and began to submit
to all the impositions of the Prince.</p>

<p>These things were so acted to the Life, that not only the
Prince, but none of his <i>Abrogratzian</i> Counsellors could see
the Snare, the Hook was so finely covered by the Church-Artificers,
and the Bait so delicious, that they all swallow'd it with
eagerness and delight.</p>

<p>But the Conspirators willing to make a sure game of it, and not
thinking the King, or all his Counsellors would drive on so fast as
they would have them, tho' they had already made a fair progress
for the Time, resolv'd to play home, and accordingly they persuade
their Prince, that they will not only submit to his Arbitrary Will,
in Matters of State, and Government, but in Matters of Religion;
and in order to carry this Jest on, <i>one of the heads of their
Politicks</i>, and a Person of great Estem for his Abilities in
Matters of State, being without question one of the ablest Heads of
all the <i>Solunarian</i> Nobility, <i>pretended to be
converted</i>, and turn'd <i>Abrogratzian</i>. This immediately
took as they desir'd, for the Prince caress'd him, and entertain'd
him with all possible endearments, proferr'd him to several Posts
of Honour and Advantage, always kept him near him, consulted him in
all Emergencies, took him with him to the <i>Abrogian</i>
Sacrifices, and he made no Scruple publickly to appear there, and
by these degrees and a <i>super-achitophalian</i> Hypocrisie, so
insinuated himself into the credulous Prince's favour, that he
became his only Confident, and absolute Master of all his
Designs.</p>

<p>Now the Plot had its desir'd effect, for he push'd the King upon
all manner of Precipitations; and if even the <i>Abrogratzians</i>
themselves who were about the King, interpos'd for more
<i>temperate Proceedings</i>, he would call them Cowards,
Strangers, ignorant of the Temper of the <i>Lunarians</i>, who when
they were a going, might be driven, but if they were suffered to
cool and consider, would face about and fall off.</p>

<p>Indeed the Men of Prudence and Estates among his own Party, I
mean the <i>Abrogratzians</i> in the Country, frequently warn'd him
to take more <i>moderate Measures</i>, and to proceed with more
Caution; told him he would certainly ruin them all, and himself,
and that there must be some Body about his Majesty that push'd him
upon these Extremes, on purpose to set all the Nation in a Flame,
and to overthrow all the good Designs, which with Temper and good
Conduct, might be brought to perfection.</p>

<p>Had these wary Councils been observ'd, and a Prudence and Policy
agreeable to the mighty consequence of Things been practis'd, the
<i>Solunarian Church</i> had run a great risque of being over
thrown, and to have sunk gradually in the <i>Abrogian Errors</i>,
the People began to be drawn off gradually, and the familiarity of
the thing made it appear less frightful to unthinking People, who
had entertain'd strange Notions of the monstrous things that were
to be seen in it, so that common Vogue had fill'd the Peoples Minds
with ignorant Aversions, that 'tis no absurdity to say, I believe
there was 200000 People who would have spent the last drop of their
Blood against <i>Abrogratzianism</i>, that did not know whether it
was a <i>Man or a Horse</i>.</p>

<p>This thing consider'd well, would of it self have been
sufficient to have made the Prince and his Friends <i>wary</i>, and
to have taught them to suit their Measures to the Nature and
Circumstances of Things before them; but <i>Success in their
beginnings</i> blinded their Eyes, and they fell into this
<i>Church Snare</i> with the most unpitied willingness that could
be imagin'd.</p>

<p>The first thing therefore this new Counsellor put his Master
upon, in order to the beginning his more certain Ruin, was to
introduce several of his <i>Abrograzians</i> into Places of all
kinds, both in the <i>Army</i>, <i>Navy</i>, <i>Treasure</i>, and
<i>Civil Affairs</i>, tho' contrary to some of the general
Constitutions of Government; he had done it into the <i>Army</i>
before, tho' it had disgusted several of his Military Men, but now
he push'd him upon making it Universal, and still the <i>Passive
Solunarians</i> bore it with patience.</p>

<p>From this tameness and submission, his next Step was to argue
that he might depend upon it the <i>Solunarian Church</i> had so
sincerely embrac'd the Doctrine of <i>Non-Resistance</i>, that they
were now ripen'd not only to sit still, and see their Brethren the
<i>Crolians</i> suppress'd, but to stand still and be opprest
themselves, and he might assure himself the Matter was now ripe, he
might do just what he wou'd himself with them, they were prepar'd
to bare any thing.</p>

<p>This was the fatal Stroke, for having possest the Prince with
the belief of this, he let loose the Reins to all his long
conceal'd Desires. Down went their <i>Laws</i>, their
<i>Liberties</i>, their <i>Corporations</i>, their <i>Churches</i>,
their <i>Colleges</i>, all went to wreck, and the eager
<i>Abrograzians</i> thought the Day their own. The
<i>Solunarians</i> made no opposition, but what was contain'd
within the narrow circumference of Petitions, Addresses,
<i>Prayers, and Tears</i>; and these the Prince was prepar'd to
reject, and upon all occasions to let them know he was <i>resolv'd
to be obey'd</i>.</p>

<p>Thus he drove on by the treacherous Advice of his new Counsels,
till he ripen'd all the Nation for the <i>general Defection</i>
which afterward follow'd.</p>

<p>For as the Encroachments of the Prince push'd especially at
their Church Liberties, and threatened the overthrow of all their
Ecclesiastical Privileges, the Clergy no sooner began to feel that
they were like to be the first Sacrifice, but they immediately
threw off the Vizor, and beat the <i>Concionazimir</i>; this is a
certain Ecclesiastick <i>Engine</i> which is usual in cases of
general Alarm, as the Churches Signal of <i>Universal
Tumult</i>.</p>

<p>This is truly a strange Engine, and when a Clergy-Man gets into
the Inside of it, and beats it, <i>it Roars</i>, and makes such a
terrible <i>Noise</i> from the several Cavities, that 'tis heard a
long way; and there are always a competent number of them plac'd in
all Parts so conveniently, that the Alarm is heard all over the
Kingdom in one Day.</p>

<p>I had some Thoughts to have given the Reader a <i>Diagram</i> of
this piece of Art, but as I am but a bad Drafts Man, I have not yet
been able so exactly to describe it, as that a Scheme can be drawn,
but to the best of my Skill, take it as follows. 'Tis a <i>hollow
Vessel</i>, large enough to hold the biggest Clergy-Man in the
Nation; it is generally <i>an Octagon</i> in Figure, <i>open
before</i>, from the <i>Wast</i> upward, but whole <i>at the
Back</i>, with <i>a Flat</i> extended over it for
<i>Reverberation</i>, or doubling the Sound; <i>doubling</i> and
<i>redoubling</i>, being frequently thought necessary to be made
use of on these occasions; 'tis very Mathematically contriv'd,
erected on <i>a Pedestal of Wood</i> like a Windmil, and has a pair
of winding Stairs up to it, like those at the great Tun at
<i>Hiedlebergh</i>.</p>

<p>I could make some <i>Hierogliphical</i> Discourses upon it, from
these References, thus. 1. That as it is erected on a Pedestal like
a Wind-Mill, so it is no new thing for the Clergy, who are the only
Persons permitted to make use of it, to make it <i>turn round with
the Wind</i>, and serve to all the Points of the Compass. 2. As the
<i>Flat</i> over it assists to encrease the Sound, by forming a
kind of hollow, or cavity proper to that purpose, so there is a
certain natural hollowness, or emptiness, made use of sometimes in
it, by the Gentlemen of the Gown, which serves exceedingly to the
propogation of all sorts of <i>Clamour</i>, <i>Noise</i>,
<i>Railing</i>, and <i>Disturbance</i>. 3. As the Stairs to it go
winding up like those by which one mounts to the vast Tun of Wine
at <i>Hiedleburgh</i>, which has no equal in <i>our World</i>, so
the use made of these ascending Steps, is not altogether different,
being frequently employ'd to raise People up to all sorts of
<i>Enthusiasms</i>, spiritual <i>Intoxications</i>, mad and
<i>extravagant Action</i>, high exalted <i>Flights</i>,
<i>Precipitations</i>, and all kinds of <i>Ecclesiastick
Drunkenness</i> and <i>Excesses</i>.</p>

<p>The sound of this Emblem of emptiness, the <i>Concionazimir</i>,
was no sooner heard over the Nation, but all the People discover'd
their readiness to <i>join in</i> with the Summons, and as the
thing had been concerted before, they send over their Messengers to
demand Assistance from a powerful Prince beyond the Sea, one of
their own Religion, and who was allied <i>by Marriage</i> to the
Crown.</p>

<p>They made their Story out so plain, and their King had by the
contrivance of their <i>Achitophel</i> rendred himself so suspected
to all his Neighbours, that this Prince, without any hesitation,
resolv'd to join with them, and accordingly makes vast Preparations
to invade their King.</p>

<p>During this interval their Behaviour was quite altred at home,
the Doctrin of <i>absolute Submission</i> and <i>Non-Resistance</i>
was heard no more among them, the <i>Concionazimir</i> beat daily
to tell all the People they should stand up to Defend the Rights of
the Church, and that it was time to look about them for the
<i>Abrograzians</i> were upon them. The eager Clergy made this
<i>Ecclesiastick Engine</i> sound as loud and make all the Noise
they could, and no Men in the Nation were so forward as they to
acknowledge that it was a State-Trick, and they were drawn in to
make such a stir about the pretended Doctrins of <i>absolute
Submission</i>, that they did not see the Snare which lay under it,
that now their Eyes were opened, and they had learnt to see the
Power and Superiority of Natural Right, and would be deceiv'd no
longer. <i>Others</i> were so honest to tell the Truth, that they
knew the emptiness and weakness of the pretence all along, and knew
what they did when they Preacht it up, <i>viz. to suppress and pull
down the Crolians</i>: But they thought their Prince who <i>they
always</i> serv'd in crying up that Doctrin, and whose Exclusion
was prevented by it, would ha' had more Gratitude, or at least more
Sense, than to try the Experiment <i>upon them</i>, since whatever
to serve his Designs and their own, <i>which they always thought
well united</i>, they were willing to pretend, he could not but see
they <i>always knew better</i> than to suffer the practice of it in
their own Case. That since he had turn'd the Tables upon them, 'tis
true he had them at an advantage and might pretend <i>they were
Knaves</i>, and perhaps had an opportunity to call them so with
some reason; but they were resolv'd, since he had drove them to the
necessity of being one or t'other, tho' he might call them Knaves,
they would take care he should have no reason to <i>call them
Fools</i> too.</p>

<p>Thus the Vapour of absolute Subjection was lost on a suddain,
and as if it had been preparatory to what was coming after, the
Experiment was quickly made; for the King persuing his
Encroachments upon the Church, and being possest with a Belief that
pursuant to their open Professions they would submit to any thing,
he made a beginning with them, in sending his positive Command to
one of his Superintendent Priests, or <i>Patriarchs</i>, to forbid
a certain Ecclesiastick to officiate any more till his Royal
Pleasure was known.</p>

<p>Now it happen'd <i>very unluckily</i> that this Patriarch, tho'
none of the most Learned of his Fraternity, yet had always been a
mighty zealous Promoter of this blind Doctrin of
<i>Non-Resistance</i>, and had not a little triumph'd over and
insulted the <i>Crolian Dissenters</i> upon the Notion of
<i>Rebellion</i>, antimonarchical Principles and Obedience, with a
reserve for the Laws, and the like, as a scandalous practice, and
comprehensive of Faction, Sedition, dangerous to the Church and
State, and the like.</p>

<p>This Reverend Father was singl'd out as the first Mark of the
King's Design; the <i>deluded Prince</i> believ'd he could not but
comply, having so publickly profest his being <i>all Submission</i>
and <i>absolute Subjection</i>; but as this was <i>all Conceit</i>,
he was pusht on to make the Assault where he was most certain to
meet a repulse; and this Gentleman had long since thrown off the
Mask, so his first Order was disobey'd.</p>

<p>The <i>Patriarch</i> pretended to make humble Remonstrances, and
to offer his Reasons why he could not in Conscience, <i>as he
call'd it</i>, comply. The King, who was now made but a meer
Engine, or <i>Machine</i>, screw'd up or down by this false
Counsellor to act his approaching Destruction with his own Hand,
<i>was prompted</i> to resent this Repulse with the utmost
Indignation, to reject all manner of Submissions, Excuses or
Arguments, or any thing but an immediate, absolute compliance,
according to the Doctrin so often inculcated; and this he run on so
high, as to put <i>the Patriarch in Prison</i> for Contumacy.</p>

<p>The <i>Patriarch</i> as absolutely refus'd to submit, and
offer'd himself to the Decision of the Law.</p>

<p>Now it was always a sacred Rule in these <i>Lunar Countries</i>,
that both <i>King</i> and <i>People</i> are bound to stand by the
arbitrimnet of <i>the Law</i> in all Cases of Right or Claim,
whether publick or private; and this has been the reason that all
the Princes have endeavour'd to cover their Actions with pretences
of Law, <i>whatever really has been in their Design</i>; for this
reason the King could not refuse to bring the Patriarch to a Tryal,
where the Humour of the People first discover'd it self, for here
<i>Passive Obedience was Try'd and Cast</i>, the Law prov'd to be
superior to the King, the Patriarch <i>was acquitted</i>, his
Disobedience to the King <i>justify'd</i>, and the King's Command
<i>prov'd unjust</i>.</p>

<p>The Applause <i>of the Patriarch</i>, the Acclamations of the
People, and the general Rejoycings of the whole Nation at this
Transaction, gave a black prospect to the <i>Abrograzians</i>; and
a great many of them came very honestly and humbly to the King and
told him, if he continued to go on by these Measures he would ruin
them all; they told him what general Alarm had been over the whole
Nation by the Clamours of the Clergy; and the beating of the
<i>Concionazimir</i> in all Parts, inform'd him how the Doctrin of
<i>absolute Obedience</i> was ridicul'd in all Places, and how the
Clergy began to preach it back again <i>like a Witches Prayer</i>,
and that it would infallibly raise the Devil of Rebellion in all
the Nation, they besought him to content himself with the liberty
of their Religion, and the freedom they enjoy'd of being let into
Places and Offices of Trust and Honour, and to wait all reasonable
Occasions to encrease their Advantages, and gradually to gain
Ground; they entreated him to consider the impossibility of
reducing so mighty, so obstinate, and so resolute a Nation all at
once. They pleaded how rational a thing it was to expect that by
Degrees and good Management, which by precipitate Measures would be
endanger'd and overthrown.</p>

<p>Had these wholsome Counsels taken place in the King's Mind he
had been King to his last hour, and the <i>Solunarians</i> and
<i>Crolians</i> too had been all undone, for he had certainly
incroach'd upon them gradually, and brought that to pass in time
which by precipitant Measures he was not likely to effect.</p>

<p>It was therefore a master-piece of Policy in the
<i>Solunarian</i> Church-men to place a feign'd Convert near their
Prince, who shou'd always biass him with contrary Advices, puff him
up with vast prospect of Success, prompt him to all Extreams, and
always Fool him with the certainty of bringing Things to pass his
own way.</p>

<p>These Arts made him set light by the repulse he met with in the
Matter of the <i>Patriarch</i>, and now he proceeds to make two
Attacks more upon the Church; one was by putting some of his
<i>Abrograzian Priests</i> into <i>a College</i> among some of the
<i>Solunarian Clergy</i>; and the other was to oblige all the
<i>Solunarian Clergy</i> to read a certain Act of his Council, in
which his Majesty admitted all the <i>Abrograzians</i>,
<i>Crolians</i>, and all sorts of Dissenters, to a freedom of their
Religious Exercises, <i>Sacrifices</i>, <i>Exorcisms</i>,
<i>Dippings</i>, <i>Preachings</i>, &amp;c. and to prohibit the
<i>Solunarians</i> to Molest or Disturb them.</p>

<p>Now as this last was a bitter reproach to the <i>Solunarian
Church</i> for all the ill Treatment the <i>Dissenting Crolians</i>
had receiv'd from them, and as it was exprest in the Act that all
such Treatment was Unjust and Unchristian, so for them to read it
in their Temples, was to acknowledge that they had been guilty of
most unjust and irreligious Dealings to the <i>Crolians</i>, and
that their Prince had taken care to do them Justice.</p>

<p>The matter of introducing the <i>Abrograzians</i> into the
Colleges or Seminaries of the <i>Solunarian Priests</i>, was
actually against the Sacred Constitutions and Foundation Laws of
<i>those Seminaries</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore in both these Articles they not only disobey'd their
Prince, but they oppos'd him with those <i>trifling Things call'd
Laws</i>, which they had before declar'd had no Defensive Force
against their Prince; these they had recourse to now, insisted upon
the Justice and Right devolv'd upon them by the Laws, and
absolutely refus'd their compliance with his Commands.</p>

<p>The Prince, pusht upon the Tenters before, receiv'd their Denial
with exceeding Resentment, and was heard with deep regret, to break
out in Exclamations at their unexpected faithless Proceedings, and
sometimes to express himself thus: <i>Horrid Hypocrisy! Surprizing
Treachery! Is this the absolute Subjection which in such numerous
Testimonials or Addresses you profest, and for which you so often
and so constantly branded the poor</i> Crolians, <i>and told me
that your Church was wholly made up of Principles of Loyalty and
Obedience! But I'll be fully satisfied for this Treatment</i>.</p>

<p>In the minute of one of those Excursions of his Passion, came
into his Presence the seemingly revolted <i>Lunarian Noble Man</i>,
and falling in with his present Passions, prompts him to a speedy
revenge; and propos'd his erecting <i>a Court of Searches</i>,
something like the <i>Spanish</i> Inquisition, giving them
plenipotentiary Authority to hear and determine all Ecclesiastical
Causes absolutely, and without Appeal.</p>

<p>He empower'd these Judges to place by his absolute Will, all the
<i>Abrograzian</i> Students in the <i>Solunarian College</i>, and
tho' they might make a formal Hearing for the sake of the Form, yet
that by Force it should be done.</p>

<p>He gave them Power to displace all those <i>Solunarian
Clergy</i>-Men that had refus'd to read his Act of Demission to the
<i>Abrograzian, and Crolian Dissenters</i>, and 'twas thought he
design'd to keep their Revenues in <i>Petto</i>, till he might in
time fill them up to some of his own Religion.</p>

<p>The Commission accordingly began to act, and discovering a full
Resolution to fulfil his Command, they by Force proceeded with the
Students of the <i>Solunarian College</i>; and it was very
remarkable, that even some of the <i>Solunarian Patriarchs</i> were
of this number, who turn'd out their Brethren the <i>Solunarian
Students</i>, to place <i>Abrograzians in their room</i>.</p>

<p>This indeed they are said to have repented of since, but
however, these it seems were not of the Plot, and therefore did not
foresee what was at hand.</p>

<p>The rest of the <i>Patriarchs</i> who were all in the Grand
Design, and saw things ripening for its Execution, upon the
apprehension of this <i>Court of Searches</i> beginning with them,
make an humble Address to their Prince, containing the Reasons why
they could not comply with his Royal Command.------</p>

<p>The incens'd King upbraided them with his having been told by
them of their absolute and <i>unreserv'd Obedience</i>, and
refusing their Submissions or their Reasons, <i>sent them all to
Jail</i>, and resolv'd to have brought them before his new <i>High
Court of Searches</i>, in order, as was believ'd, to have them all
displac'd.</p>

<p>And now all began to be in a Flame, the Sollicitations of the
<i>Solunarian Party</i>, having obtain'd powerful Relief Abroad,
they began to make suitable preparations at Home. The Gentry and
Nobility who the Clergy had brought to join with them, furnish'd
themselves with Horses and Arms, and prepar'd with their Tenants
and Dependants to join the Succours as soon as they should
Arrive.</p>

<p>In short, the Forreign Troops they had procur'd, Arriv'd,
Landed, and publish'd a long Declaration of all the Grievances
which they came to redress.</p>

<p>No sooner was this Forreign Army arriv'd with the Prince at the
head of them, but the face of Affairs <i>altred on a suddain</i>.
The King indeed, like a brave Prince, drew all his Forces together,
and marching out of his Capital City, advanced above 500
<i>Stages</i>, things <i>they measure Land with in those
Countries</i>, and much about <i>our Furlong</i>, to meet his
Enemy.</p>

<p>He had a gallant Army well appointed and furnish'd, and all
things much superior to his Adversary, but alas the Poison of
Disobedience was gotten in there, and upon the first <i>March</i>
he offer'd to make towards the Enemy one of <i>his great
Captains</i> with a strong Party of his Men went over and
revolted.</p>

<p>This Example was applauded all over the Nation, and by this time
one of the Patriarchs, even the same mention'd before that had so
often preacht Non-Resistance of Princes, lays by his Sacred
Vestments, Mitre, and Staff, and exchanging his Robes for a
Soldier's Coat, mounts on Horseback, and in short, appears in Arms
against his Lord.----- Nor was this all, but the <i>Treacherous
Prelate</i> takes along with him several <i>Solunarian Lords</i>,
and Persons of the highest Figure, and of the Houshold, and Family
of the King, and with him went the King's own Daughter, his
principle Favourites and Friends.</p>

<p>At the News of this, the poor deserted Prince lost all Courage,
and abandoning himself to Despair, he causes his Army to retreat
without fighting a Stroke, quits them and the Kingdom at once, and
takes Sanctuary with such as could escape with him, in the Court of
a Neighbouring Prince.</p>

<p>I have heard this Prince exceedingly blam'd, for giving himself
up to Despair so soon. ----- That he thereby abandon'd the best and
faithfullest of his Friends, and Servants, and left them to the
Mercy of the <i>Solunarians</i>; that when all these that would
have forsaken him were gone, he had Forces equal to his Enemies;
that his Men were in Heart, fresh and forward; that he should have
stood to the last; retreated to a strong Town, where his Ships rod,
and which was over against the Territories of his great Allie, to
whom he might have deliver'd up the Ships which were there, and
have thereby made him Superior at Sea to his Enemies, and he was
already much Superior at Land; that there he might have been
reliev'd with Forces too strong for them to match, and at least
might have put it to the issue of a fair Battle.------ Others, that
he might have retreated to his own Court, and capital City, and
taking possession of the Citadel, which was his own, might so have
aw'd the Citizens who were infinitely Rich, and Numerous, with the
apprehensions of having their Houses burnt, they would not have
dar'd to have declar'd for his Enemies, for fear of being reduc'd
to heaps and ruins; and that at last he might have set the City on
Fire in 500 Places, and left the <i>Solunarian Church-Men</i> a
Token to remember their <i>Non-Resisting Doctrine by</i>, and yet
have made an easy Retreat down the Harbour, to other Forts he had
below, and might with ease have destroy'd all the Shipping, as he
went.</p>

<p>'Tis confess'd had he done either, or both these things, he had
left them a dear bought Victory, but he was depriv'd of his
Counsellor, for as soon as things came to this height, <i>the
Achitophel</i> we have so often mention'd, <i>left him also</i>,
and went away; all his <i>Abrograzian Priests too fosook him</i>,
and he was so bereft of Counsel that he fell into the Hands of his
Enemies as he was making his escape, but he got away again, not
without the connivance of the Enemy, who were willing enough he
should go; so he got a Vessel to carry him over to the Neighbouring
Kingdom, and all his Armies, Ships, Forts, Castles, Magazines, and
Treasure, fell into his Enemies Hands.</p>

<p>The Neighbouring Prince entertain'd him very kindly, Cherish'd
him, Succour'd him, and furnish'd him with Armies and Fleets for
the recovery of his Dominions, which has occasion'd a tedious War
with that Prince, which continues to this Day.</p>

<p>Thus far <i>Passive Doctrins</i>, and Absolute Submission serv'd
a Turn, <i>bubl'd the Prince</i>, wheedled him in to take their
Word who profess'd it, 'till he laid his Finger upon the Men
themselves, and that unravell'd all the Cheat; they were the first
that call'd in Forreign Power, and took up Arms against their
Prince.</p>

<p>Nor did they end here, but all this Scene being over, and the
Forreign Prince having thus deliver'd them, and their own King
being thus chas'd away, the People call themselves together, and
<i>as Reason good</i>, having been deliver'd by him from the
Miseries, Brangles, Oppressions, and Divisions of the former Reign,
they thought they could do no less than to Crown their Deliverer;
and having Summon'd a general Assembly of all their <i>Capital
Men</i>, they gave the Crown to this Prince who had so generously
sav'd them.</p>

<p>And here again I heard the first King exceedingly blam'd for
quitting his Dominions, for had he staid here, tho' he had actually
been in their Hands, unless they wou'd have Murther'd him, they
could never have proceeded to the Extremeties they did reach to,
nor cou'd they ever have Crown'd the other Prince, he being yet
alive and in his own Dominions.</p>

<p>But by quitting the Country, they fix'd a legal Period to their
Obedience, he having deserted their Protection, and Defence, and
openly laid down the Administration.</p>

<p>But as these sort of Politicks cannot be decided by us, unless
we know the Constitutions of those <i>Lunar Regions</i>, so we
cannot pretend to make a Decision of what might, or might not have
happen'd.</p>

<p>It remains to examine how those <i>Solunarians</i> behav'd
themselves, who had so earnedly cryed up the Principles of
Obedience, and absolute Submission.</p>

<p><i>Nothing was so Ridiculous</i>, now they saw what they had
done, they began to repent, and upon recollection of Thoughts some
were so asham'd of themselves, that having broken their Doctrin,
and being now call'd upon to tranfpose their Allegiance, truly they
stopt in the mid-way, and <i>so became Martyrs on both
sides</i>.</p>

<p>I can liken these to nothing so well as to those Gentlemen of
our <i>English Church</i>, who tho' they broke into the Principles
of Passive Obedience by joining, and calling over the P. of
<i>O</i>. yet suffer'd deprivations of Benefices, and loss of their
Livings, <i>for not taking the Oath</i>; as if they had not as
<i>effectually perjur'd themselves</i> by taking up Arms against
their King, and joyning a Forreign Power, as they could possibly do
afterward, by Swearing to live quietly under the next King.</p>

<p>But these nice Gentlemen are infinitely outdone in these
Countries, for these <i>Solunarians</i> by a true Church turn, not
only refuse to transpose their Allegiance, but pretend to wipe
their Mouths as to former taking Arms, and return to their old
Doctrins of absolute Submission, boast of Martyrdom, and boldly
reconcile the contraries of <i>taking up Arms</i>, and
<i>Non-Resistance</i>, charging all their Brethren with Schism,
Rebellion, Perjury, and the <i>damnable Sin of Resistance</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nor is this all</i>, for as a great many of these
<i>Solunarian Church</i>-Men had no affection to this new Prince,
but were not equally furnished, or qualify'd for Martyrdom with
their Brethren; they went to certain Wise Men, who being cunning at
<i>splitting Hairs</i>, and making distinctions, might perhaps
furnish them with <i>some mediums between Loyalty and
Disloyalty</i>; they apply'd themselves with great dilligence to
these Men, and they by deep Study, and long Search, <i>either found
or made</i> the quaintest Device for them that ever was heard
of.</p>

<p>By this unheard of Discovery, to their great Joy and
Satisfaction, they have arriv'd at a Power, which all the Wise Men
in our World could never pretend to, and which 'tis thought, could
the description of it be regularly made, and brought down hither,
would serve for the Satisfaction and Repose of a great many tender
Consciences, who are very uneasy at <i>Swearing to save their
Benefices</i>.</p>

<p>These great Makers of Distinction, have learn't to distinguish
between <i>active</i> Swearing, and <i>passive</i> Swearing,
between <i>de facto</i> Loyalty, and <i>de jure</i> Loyalty, and by
this decent acquirement they obtain'd the Art of reconciling
<i>Swearing Allegiance without Loyalty</i>, and <i>Loyalty without
Swearing</i>, so that native and original Loyalty may be preserv'd
pure and uninterrupted, in spight of all <i>subsequent Oaths, to
prevailing Usurpations</i>.</p>

<p>Many are the Mysteries, and vast the Advantages of this new
invented Method, <i>Mental Reservations</i>, <i>Inuendoes</i>, and
Double Meanings <i>are Toys to this</i>, for they may be provided
for in the litteral terms of an Oath, but no Provision can be made
against this; for these Men after they have taken the Oath, make no
Scruple to declare, <i>they only Swear to be quiet, as long as they
can make no Disturbance</i>; that they are left liberty still to
espouse the Interest and Cause of their former Prince, they nicely
distinguish between <i>Obedience</i> and <i>Submission</i>, and
tell you a <i>Slave taken into Captivity</i>, tho' he Swears <i>to
live peaceably</i>, does not thereby renounce his <i>Allegiance</i>
to his natural Prince, nor abridge himself of a Right to attempt
his own Liberty <i>if ever opportunity present</i>.</p>

<p>Had these neat Distinctions been found out before, none of our
<i>Solunarian Clergy</i>, no not the <i>Patriarchs</i> themselves
surely would have stood out, and suffer'd such Depredations on
their Fortunes and Characters as they did; they wou'd never have
been such Fools to have been turn'd out of their Livings for not
Swearing, when they might have learnt here that they <i>might have
swore to one Prince, and yet have retain'd their Allegiance to
another</i>; might have taken an Oath to the new, without
impeachment of their old Oaths to the absent Prince.------- <i>It
is great pity these Gentlemen had not gone up to the</i> Moon
<i>for Instruction in this difficult Case</i>.</p>

<p>There they might have met with excellent Logicians, Men of most
sublime Reasons, Dr. <i>Overall</i>, Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>, and all
our nice Examiners of these things wou'd appear to be no Body to
them; for as the People in these Regions have an extraordinary
<i>Eye-sight</i>, and the clearness of the Air contributs much to
the help of their <i>Opticks</i>, so they have without doubt a
proportion'd clearness of discerning, by which they see as far
<i>into Mill-stones</i>, and all sorts of Solids, as the nature of
things will permit, but above all, their Faculties are blest with
two exceeding Advantages.</p>

<p>1. <i>With an extraordinary distinguishing Power</i>, by which
they can distinguish <i>even Indivisibles</i>, part Unity it self,
<i>divide Principles</i>, and <i>distinguish Truth</i> into such
and so many <i>minute Particles</i>, till they dwindle it away into
a very Nose of Wax, and mould it into any Form they have occasion
for, by which means they can distinguish themselves into or out of
any Opinion, either in Religion, Politicks or Civil Right, that
their present Emergencies may call for.</p>

<p>2. Their reasoning Faculties have this further advantage, that
upon occasion <i>they can see clearly for themselves</i>, and
<i>prevent others from the same discovery</i>, so that when they
have occasion to see any thing which presents for their own
Advantage, they can search into the Particulars, make it clear to
themselves, and yet let it remain dark and mysterious to all the
World besides. Whether this is perform'd by their exceeding
Penetration, or by casting an artificial Veil over the
Understandings of the Vulgar, <i>Authors have not yet
determin'd</i>; but that the Fact is true, admits of no
Dispute.</p>

<p>And the wonderful Benefit of these Things in point of Dispute is
extraordinary, for they can see clearly they have the better of an
Argument, when all the rest of the World think they have not a Word
to say for themselves: 'Tis plain to them that this or that proves
a thing, when Nature, by common Reasoning, knows no such
Consequences.</p>

<p>I confess I have seen some weak Attempts at this extraordinary
Talent, particularly in the Disputes in <i>England</i> between the
<i>Church and the Dissenter</i>, and between the <i>High and Low
Church</i>, wherein People have tollerably well convinc'd
themselves when no Body else could see any thing of the Matter, as
particularly the famous Mr. <i>W---ly</i> about the
<i>Antimonarchical Principles taught in the Dissenters
Accademies</i>; <i>ditto</i> in <i>L----sly</i>, about the
Dissenters <i>burning the City</i>, and setting Fire to their own
Houses to destroy their Neighbours; and <i>another famous
Author</i>, who prov'd that <i>Christopher Love</i> lost his Head
for attempting to pull down Monarchy by restoring King
<i>Charles</i> the Second.</p>

<p>These indeed are some faint Resemblances of what I am upon; but
alas! these are tender sort of People, that han't obtain'd <i>a
compleat Victory over their Consciences</i>, but suffer <i>that
Trifle</i> to reproach them all the while they are doing it, to
rebel against their resolv'd Wills, and check them in the middle of
the Design; from which Interruptions arise Palpitations of the
Heart, Sickness and squeamishness of Stomach; and these have
proceeded to <i>Castings and Vomit</i>, whereby they have been
forc'd sometimes to throw up some such unhappy Truths as have
confounded all the rest, and flown in their own Faces so violently,
as in spight of Custom has made them blush and look downward; and
tho' in kindness to one another they have carefully lickt up <i>one
anothers Filth</i>, yet this unhappy squeamishness of Stomach has
spoil'd all the Design, and turn'd the Appetites of their Party, to
the no small prejudice of a Cause that stood in need of more Art
and <i>more Face</i> to carry it on as it shou'd be with a
thoro'-pac'd <i>Case-harden'd Policy</i>, such as I have been
relating, is compleatly obtain'd in these Regions, where the Arts
and Excellencies of sublime Reasonings are carried up to all the
extraordinaries of <i>banishing Scruples</i>, reconciling
Contradictions, <i>uniting Opposites</i>, and all the necessary
Circumstances requir'd in a compleat Casuist.</p>

<p>'Tis not easily conceivable to what extraordinary Flights they
have carry'd this strength of Reasoning, for besides the
distinguishing nicely between Truth and Error, they obtain a most
refin'd Method of distinguishing <i>Truth it self into Seasons and
Circumstances</i>, and so can bring any thing to be Truth, when it
serves the turn that happens just then to be needful, and make the
same thing to be false at another time.</p>

<p>And this method of <i>circumstantiating Matters of Fact</i> into
Truth or Falshood, suited to occasion, is found admirably useful to
the solving the most difficult <i>Ph&aelig;nomena of State</i>, for
by this Art the <i>Solunarian Church</i> made Persecution be
against their Principles at one time, and reducible to Practice at
another. They made <i>taking up Arms</i>, and calling in Foreign
Power to depose their Prince, <i>consistent with Non-Resistance,
and Passive Obedience</i>; nay they went farther, they distinguisht
between <i>a Crolian's</i> taking Arms, and <i>a Solunarians</i>,
and fairly prov'd this to be <i>Rebellion</i> and that to be
<i>Non-Resistance</i>.</p>

<p>Nay, and which exceeded all the Power of human Art in the
highest degrees of Attainment that ever it arriv'd to on <i>our
side the Moon</i>; they turn'd the Tables so dexterously, as to
argument upon one sort of <i>Crolians</i>, call'd
<i>Prestarians</i>; that tho' they repented of the War they had
rais'd in former Times, and protested against the violence offer'd
their Prince; and after another Party had <i>in spight of them</i>
Beheaded him, <i>took Arms</i> against the <i>other Party</i>, and
never left contriving their Ruin, till they had <i>brought in his
Son</i>, and set him upon the Throne again.</p>

<p>Yet by this most dextrous way of <i>Twisting</i>,
<i>Extending</i>, <i>Contracting</i>, and <i>Distinguishing</i> of
Phrases and Reasoning, they presently made it as plain as the Sun
at Noon Day; that these <i>Prestarians</i> were
<i>King-killers</i>, Common-wealths Men, <i>Rebels</i>, Traytors,
and <i>Enemies to Monarchy</i>; that they <i>restor'd</i> the
Monarchy only in order <i>to Destroy it</i>, and that they Preach'd
up <i>Sedition</i>, <i>Rebellion</i> and the like: This was prov'd
so plain by these <i>sublime Distinctions</i>, that they convinc'd
themselves and their Posterity of it, by a rare and newly acquir'd
Art, found out <i>by extraordinary Study</i>, which proves the
wonderful power of <i>Custom</i>, insomuch, that let any Man by
this method, <i>tell a Lye over a certain number of times</i>, he
shall arrive to a Satisfaction <i>of its certainty</i>, tho' he
knew it to be <i>a Fiction before</i>, and shall freely <i>tell it
for a Truth all his life after</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Prestarians</i> were call'd the Murtherers of <i>the
Father</i>, tho' they restor'd <i>the Son</i>, and all the
Testimonials of their Sufferings, Protests and Insurrections to
prevent his Death, <i>signify'd nothing</i>, for this method of
<i>Distinguishing</i> has that powerful Charm in it, that all
<i>those Trifles</i> we call Proofs and Demonstration were of no
use in that Case. <i>Custom</i> brought the Story up to a Truth,
and in an instant all the <i>Crolians</i> were hookt in under the
general Name of <i>Prestarians</i>, at the same time to hook all
Parties in the Crime.</p>

<p>Now as it happen'd at last that these <i>Solunarian
Gentlemen</i> found it necessary to <i>do the same thing
themselves</i>, viz. To lay aside their Loyalty, <i>Depose</i>,
<i>Fight</i> against, <i>shoot Bullets</i> at, and throw Bombs
<i>at their King</i> till they frighted him away, and <i>sent him
abroad to beg his Bread</i>. The <i>Crolians</i> began to take
Heart and tell them, now they ought <i>to be Friends with them</i>,
and tell them no more of <i>Rebellion</i> and <i>Disloyalty</i>;
nay, they carry'd it so far as to challenge them to bring <i>their
Loyalty to the Test</i>, and compare <i>Crolian Loyalty</i> and
<i>Solunarian Loyalty</i> together, and see who had <i>rais'd more
Wars</i>, taken up Arms <i>oftenest</i>, or appear'd in <i>most
Rebellions</i> against their Kings; nay, who had <i>kill'd most
Kings</i>, the <i>Crolians</i> or the <i>Solunarians</i>, for there
having been then newly fought a great Battle between the
<i>Solunarian Church-Men</i> under their new Prince, and the Armies
of Foreign Succours under <i>their old King</i>, in which their
<i>old King</i> was beaten and forc'd to flie a second time, the
<i>Crolians</i> told them that every Bullet they shot at the Battle
was as much <i>a murthering their King</i>, as cutting off the Head
<i>with a Hatchet</i> was a killing his Father.</p>

<p>These Arguments in our World would have been unanswerable, but
when they came to be brought to <i>the Test of Lunar Reasoning</i>,
alas they signify'd nothing; they <i>distinguisht</i> and
<i>distinguisht</i> till they brought the <i>Prestarian War</i> to
be meer Rebellion, <i>King-killing</i>, Bloody and
<i>Unnatural</i>; and the <i>Solunarian</i> fighting against their
King, and <i>turning him adrift</i> to seek his Fortune, <i>no
prejudice at all to their Loyalty</i>, no, nor to the famous
Doctrine of <i>Passive Obedience</i> and Absolute Subjection.</p>

<p><i>When I saw this</i>, I really bewail'd the unhappiness of
some of our Gentlemen in <i>England</i>, who standing exceedingly
in need of such a wonderful Dexterity of Argument to defend their
share <i>in our late Revolution</i>, and to reconcile it to their
<i>anticedent</i> and <i>subsequent</i> Conduct, should not be
furnish'd from this more <i>accurate World</i> with the suitable
Powers, in order the better to defend them against the
<i>Banter</i> and <i>just Raillery</i> of their ill-natur'd Enemies
<i>the Whigs</i>.</p>

<p>By this they might have attained suitable reserves of Argument
to distinguish themselves <i>out of their Loyalty</i>, and <i>into
their Loyalty</i>, as occasion presented to dismiss <i>this</i>
Prince, and entertain <i>that</i>, as they found it to their
purpose; but above all, they might have learnt a way how to justify
<i>Swearing</i> to one King and <i>Praying</i> for another,
<i>Eating</i> one Prince's Bread and <i>doing</i> another Prince's
<i>Work</i>, <i>Serving</i> one King they don't <i>Love</i> and
<i>Loving</i> another they don't <i>Serve</i>; they might easily
reconcile the Schisms of the Church, and prove they are still Loyal
Subjects <i>to King James</i>, while they are only forc'd Bonds-Men
to the <i>Act of Settlement</i>, for the sake of that comfortable
Importance, call'd <i>Food and Rainment</i>; and thus their
Reputation might have been sav'd, which is most <i>unhappily
tarnish'd</i> and blur'd, with the malicious Attacks of <i>the
Whigs</i> on one Hand, and the <i>Non-Jurants</i> on the other.</p>

<p><i>These</i> Tax them as above with Rebellion by their own
Principles, and contradicting the Doctrin of <i>Passive
Submission</i> and Non-Resistance, by taking up Arms against their
Prince, calling in a <i>Foreign Power</i>, and deposing him: They
charge them with killing the <i>Lord's Anointed</i>, by Shooting at
him <i>at the Boyn</i>, where if he was not kill'd it was his own
fault, at least 'tis plain <i>'twas none of theirs</i>.</p>

<p>On the other Hand, the <i>Non Jurant Clergy</i> charge them with
<i>Schism</i>, declare the whole Church of <i>England</i>
<i>Schismaticks</i>, and breakers off from the general Union of the
Church, in renouncing their Allegiance, and Swearing to <i>another
Power</i>, their former Prince being <i>yet alive</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis confest all <i>the Answers</i> they have been able to make
to these things, are <i>very weak</i> and <i>mean</i>, unworthy Men
of their Rank and Capacities, and 'tis pity they should not be
assisted by some kind Communication of these <i>Lunar Arguments</i>
and <i>Distinctions</i>, without which, and till they can obtain
which, a <i>Conforming Jacobite</i> must be the absurdest
Contradiction in Nature; a thing that admits of no manner of
Defence, no, not by the <i>People themselves</i>, and which they
would willingly abandon, but that they can find no side to join
with them.</p>

<p>The <i>Dissenting Jacobites</i> have some Plea for themselves,
for let their Opinion be never so repugnant to their own Interest,
or general Vogue, they are <i>faithful to some thing</i>, and they
wont joyn with these People, because they have <i>Perjur'd their
Faith</i>, and yet pretend to adhere to it at the same time. The
<i>Conforming Whigs</i> won't receive them, because they pretend to
rail at the Government they have Sworn to, and espouse the Interest
they have Sworn against; so that these <i>poor Creatures</i> have
but one way left them, which is <i>to go along with me</i>, next
time I Travel <i>to the Moon</i>, and that will most certainly do
their Business, for when they come down again, they will be quite
<i>another sort of Men</i>, the Distinctions, the Power of
Argument, the way of Reasoning, they will be then furnish'd with
will quite change <i>the Scene of the World with them</i>, they'll
certainly be able to prove they are the only People, both <i>in
Justice</i>, in <i>Politicks</i> and in <i>Prudence</i>; that the
extremities of every side are <i>in the Wrong</i>, they'll prove
their Loyalty preserv'd, untainted, thro' all the <i>Swearings</i>,
<i>Fightings</i>, <i>Shootings</i> and the like, and no Body will
be able <i>to come to the Test with them</i>; so that upon the
whole, they are all distracted if they don't <i>go up to the
Moon</i> for Illumination, and that they may easily do in the next
<i>Consolidator</i>.</p>

<p>But as this is a very long Digression, and for which I am to beg
my Reader's Pardon, being an Error I slipt into from my abundant
respect to these Gentlemen, and for their particular Instruction, I
shall endeavour to make my Reader amends, by keeping more close to
my Subject.</p>

<p>To return therefore to the Historical part of the <i>Solunarian
Church-Men</i>, in <i>the World in the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>Having as is related <i>Depos'd their King</i>, and plac'd the
Crown upon the Head of the Prince that came to their assistance, a
new Scene began all over the Kingdom.</p>

<p>1. <i>A terrible and bloody
War</i> began thro' all the parts of the <i>Lunar World</i>, where
their banish'd Prince and his new Allie had any Interest; and the
new King having a universal Character over all the Northern
Kingdoms of the Moon, he brought in a great many Potent
<i>Kings</i>, <i>Princes</i>, <i>Emperors</i> and <i>States</i>, to
take part with him, and so it became the most general War that had
happen'd in those Ages.</p>

<p>I did not trouble my self to enquire into the particular
Successes <i>of this War</i>, but at what had a more particular
regard to the Country from whence I came, and <i>for whose
Instruction</i> I have design'd <i>these Sheets</i>, the Strife
<i>of Parties</i>, the Internal Feuds at home, and their <i>Analogy
to ours</i>; and whatever is instructively to be deduced from them,
was the Subject of immediate Inquiry.</p>

<p>No sooner was this Prince plac'd on the Throne, but according to
his Promises to them that invited him over, he conven'd the Estates
of the Realm, and giving them free Liberty to <i>make</i>,
<i>alter</i>, <i>add</i> or <i>repeal</i>, all such Laws as they
thought fit, it must be <i>their own fault</i> if they did not
Establish themselves upon such Foundation of <i>Liberty</i>, and
<i>Right</i>, as they desir'd; for he gave them their <i>full
Swing</i>, never interpos'd <i>one Negative</i> upon them for
several Years, and let them do almost every thing they pleas'd.</p>

<p>This <i>full Liberty</i> had like to have spoil'd all, for as is
before noted, this Nation had <i>one unhappy Quality</i> they could
never be broke of, always to <i>be falling out</i> one among
another.</p>

<p>The <i>Crolians</i>, according to Capitulation, demanded the
full Liberty and Toleration of Religion, which the
<i>Solunarians</i> had condition'd with them for, when they drew
them off from joyning with the <i>old King</i>, and when they
promis'd to come <i>to a Temper</i>, and to <i>be Brethren in Peace
and Love ever after</i>.</p>

<p>Nor were the <i>Solunarian</i> Church-Men backward, either to
remember, or perform the Conditions but by the consent of the King,
who had been by agreement made <i>Guarantee of their former
Stipulations</i>, an Act was drawn up in full Form, and as
compleat, as both satisfy'd the desires of the <i>Crolians</i>, and
testify'd the Honesty and Probity of the <i>Solunarians</i>, as
they were abstractedly and <i>moderately</i> consider'd.</p>

<p>During the whole Reign of this King, this <i>Union of
Parties</i> continu'd without any considerable Interruption, there
was indeed <i>brooding Mischiefs</i> which hovered over every
accident, in order to <i>generate Strife</i>, but the Candor of the
Prince, and the Prudence of his Ministers, kept it under for a long
time.</p>

<p>At last an occasion offer'd it self, which gave an unhappy
Stroke to the Nation's Peace. The King thro' <i>innumerable
Hazards</i>, terrible <i>Battles</i> and <i>a twelve Years War</i>,
had reduc'd his powerful Adversary to such a necessity of Peace,
that he became content to abandon <i>the fugitive King</i>, and to
own the Title of this Warlike Prince; and upon these, among various
other Conditions, <i>very Honourable for him</i>, and his Allies,
and by which vast Conquests were surrendred, and <i>disgorg'd to
the Losers</i>, a Peace was made to the Universal Satisfaction of
all those Parts of <i>the Moon</i> that had been involv'd in a
tiresome and expensive War.</p>

<p>This Peace was no sooner made, but the Inhabitants of this
unhappy Country, according <i>to the constant Practice</i> of the
Place, fell out in the most horrid manner among themselves, and
with the very Prince that had done all these <i>great things for
them</i>; and I cannot forget how the Old Gentleman I had these
Relations from, being once deeply engag'd in Discourse with <i>some
Senators</i> of that Country, and hearing <i>them reproach the
Memory of that Prince</i> from whom they <i>receiv'd so much</i>,
and on the foot of whose <i>Gallantry</i> and <i>Merit</i> the
Constitution <i>then subsisted</i>, it put him into some heat, and
he told them to their Faces that they were guilty both of
<i>Murther and Ingratitude</i>.</p>

<p>I thought the Charge was very high, but as they return'd upon
him, and challeng'd him to make it out, he answer'd he was <i>ready
to do it</i>, and went on thus.</p>

<p>His Majesty, <i>said he</i>, left a quiet, retir'd, compleatly
happy Condition, <i>full of Honour</i>, belov'd of his Country,
<i>Vallu'd</i> and <i>Esteem'd</i>, as well <i>as Fear'd</i> by his
Enemies, to come over hither at your own Request, to deliver you
from the Encroachments and Tyranny <i>as you call'd it</i>, of your
Prince.</p>

<p>Ever since he came hither, he has been your meer
<i>Journy-Man</i>, your <i>Servant</i>, your <i>Souldier of
Fortune</i>, he has <i>Fought</i> for you, <i>Fatigu'd</i> and
<i>Harras'd</i> his Person, and <i>rob'd himself</i> of all his
Peace <i>for you</i>; he has been in a constant Hurry, and run
thro' <i>a Million of Hazards for you</i>; he has convers'd with
Fire and Blood, <i>Storms at Sea</i>, Camps and Trenches ashore,
and given himself no rest for <i>twelve Years</i>, and all for
<i>your Use</i>, Safety and Repose: In requital of which, he has
been always treated with <i>Jealousies</i>, and <i>Suspitions</i>,
with <i>Reproaches</i>, and <i>Abuses of all Sorts</i>, and on all
Occasions, till the ungrateful Treatment of the <i>Solunarians</i>
eat into <i>his very Soul</i>, tir'd it with serving <i>an
unthankful Nation</i>, and absolutely <i>broke his Heart</i>; for
which reason I think him <i>as much Murther'd</i> as his
Predecessor was, <i>whose Head was cut off</i> by his Subjects.</p>

<p>I could not when this was over, but ask the <i>Old
Gentlemen</i>, what was the reason of his Exclamation, and how it
was the People treated their Prince upon this occasion?</p>

<p>He told me it was a grievous Subject, and a long one, and too
long to rehearse, but he would give me a short Abridgment of it;
and not to look back into his Wars, in which he was abominably ill
serv'd, <i>his subjects constantly ill treated him</i> in giving
him Supplies <i>too late</i>, that he cou'd not get into the Field,
nor forward his Preparations <i>in time</i> to be ready for his
Enemies, who frequently were ready to insult him in his
Quarters.</p>

<p>By giving him <i>sham Taxes</i> and <i>Funds, that raised little
or no Mony</i>, by which he having borrow'd Mony of his People by
Anticipation, the Funds not answering, he contracted such <i>vast
Debts</i> as the Nation <i>could never Pay</i> which brought the
War <i>into disrepute</i>, sunk the Credit of his Exchequer, and
fill'd the Nation with Murmurs and Complaint.</p>

<p><i>By betraying his Counsel</i> and well laid Designs to his
Enemies, <i>selling their Native Country to Foreigners</i>,
retarding their Navies and Expeditions, till the Enemies were
provided to receive them, <i>betraying their Merchants</i> and
Trade, spending vast Sums to fit out Fleets, <i>just time
enough</i> to go Abroad, and do nothing, and then <i>get Home
again</i>.</p>

<p>But as these were too numerous Evils, and too long to repeat,
the particular things he related to in his Discourse, were these
that follow.</p>

<p>There had been <i>a hasty Peace</i> concluded with a furious and
powerful Enemy, the King <i>foresaw it would be of no
continnuace</i>, and that the demise of a neighbouring King, who by
all appearance could not live long, would certainly embroil them
again.----- He saw that Prince keep up numerous Legions of Forces,
in order to be in a posture to break the Peace with advantage. This
the King fairly represented to them, and told them the necessity of
keeping up <i>such a Force</i>, and for such a Time, at least as
might be necessary to awe the Enemy from putting any affront upon
them in case of the Death of that Prince, which they daily
expected.</p>

<p>The Party who had all along malign'd the Prosperity of this
Prince, <i>took fire at the Offer</i>, and here began another State
Plot, which tho' it hookt in two or three sets of Men for different
Ends, yet altogether join'd in affronting and ill treating their
Prince, upon this Article of the Army.</p>

<p><i>The Nation had been in danger enough</i> from the designs of
former Princes invading their Priviledges, and putting themselves
in a Posture to Tyrannize by the help <i>of standing Forces</i>,
and the Party that first took Fire at this Proposal tho' the very
same Men who in the time of an <i>Abrogratzian</i> Prince, were for
caressing him, and <i>giving him Thanks for his Standing Army</i>,
as has been noted before, were the very People that began the
outcry against this Demand, and <i>so specious were the
Pretences</i> they made, that they drew in the very <i>Crolians
themselves</i> upon the pretence of Liberty, and Exemption from
Arbitrary Methods of Government <i>to oppose their King</i>.</p>

<p><i>It griev'd this good Prince</i> to be suspected of Tyrannick
Designs, and that by a Nation who he had done so much, and ventur'd
so far to save <i>from Tyranny, and Standing Armies</i>; 'twas
<i>in vain</i> he represented to them the pressing occasion; <i>in
vain</i> he gave them a Description of <i>approaching Dangers</i>,
and the threatning posture of the Enemies Armies; <i>in vain</i> he
told them of the probabilities of renewing the War, and how keeping
but <i>a needful Force</i> might be a means of preventing it; <i>in
vain</i> he propos'd the subjecting what Force should be necessary
to the Absolute Power, both as to Time and Number of their own
<i>Cortez</i> or <i>National Assembly</i>.</p>

<p><i>It was all one</i>, the Design being form'd in the Breasts of
those who were <i>neither Friends to the Nation, nor the King</i>,
those Reasons which would have been of Force in another Case, made
them the more eager; <i>bitter Reflections were made on the
King</i>, and scurrilous Lampoons publish'd upon the Subject of
Tyrants, and Governing by Armies.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more ungrateful to <i>a generous Prince</i>,
nor could any thing more deeply affect this King, <i>than whom</i>
none ever had a more <i>genuine, single-hearted Design for the
Peoples good</i>, but above all, like <i>C&aelig;sar</i> in the
Case of <i>Brutus</i>, it heartily mov'd him to find himself push'd
at by those very People whom he had all along seen, pretending to
adhere to <i>his Interest</i>, and the <i>Publick Benefit</i>,
which he had always taken care should <i>never be parted</i>, and
to find these People join against this Proposal, <i>as a Design
against their Liberties</i>, and as a Foundation of Tyranny
<i>heartily and sensibly afflicted him</i>.</p>

<p><i>It was a strange Mistery</i>, and not easily unriddled, that
those Men who had always a known aversion to the Interest of the
depos'd King should fall in with this Party, and those that were
Friends to the general Good, never forgave it them.</p>

<p><i>All that could be said to excuse them</i>, was the Plot I am
speaking of, that by carrying this Point for that Party, they hookt
in those forward People to join in a popular Cry of Liberty and
Property, <i>things they were never fond of before</i>, and to make
some Settlement of the Peoples Claims <i>which they always had
oppos'd</i>, and which they would <i>since have been very glad to
have repeal'd</i>.</p>

<p>So great an Ascendant had the <i>Personal Spleen</i> of this
Party over their other Principles, that they were content to <i>let
the Liberties of the People be declar'd</i> in their highest
Claims, rather than not obtain this one Article, which they knew
would <i>so exceedingly mortify their Prince</i>, and strengthen
the Nations Enemies. They freely join'd in <i>Acts of Succession,
Abjuration, Declaration</i> of the Power and <i>Claims of the
People</i>, and the Superiority of their Right to the Princes
Prerogative, and abundance of such things, <i>which they could
never be otherwise brought to</i>.</p>

<p><i>'Tis true these were great things</i>, but 'twas thought all
this might have been obtain'd <i>in Conjunction with their
Prince</i>, rather than by putting Affronts and Mortifications upon
the Man that had next to the Influence of Heaven been the only
Agent of restoring them to a Power and Capacity of enjoying, as
well as procuring, such things as National Priviledges.</p>

<p>'Twas vigorosly alledg'd that <i>Standing Armies in times of
Peace, were inconsistent with the Publick Safety</i>, the Laws and
Constitutions of all the Nations <i>in the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>But these Allegations were strenuously answer'd, that it was
true without the consent of the great National Council, it was so,
but <i>that being obtain'd</i>, it was not illegal, and publick
Necessities might make that consent, not only legal, but
convenient.</p>

<p><i>'Twas all to no purpose</i>, the whole was carry'd with a
Torrent of Clamour and Reflection against the good Prince, <i>who
consented</i>, because he would in nothing oppose the Current of
the People; but withal, told them plainly what would be the
consequences of their Heat, <i>which they have effectually found
true since</i> to their Cost, and to the loss of some Millions of
Treasure.</p>

<p>For no sooner was this Army broke, <i>which was the best ever
that Nation saw</i>, and was justly the Terror of the Enemy, but
the great Monarch we mention'd before, broke all Measures with this
Prince and the Confederate Nations, a Proof what just apprehensions
they had of his Conduct, at the head of such an Army. For <i>they
broke with contempt</i>, a Treaty which the Prince <i>upon a
prospect of this unkindness of his People</i> had entred into with
the Enemy, and which he engag'd in, if possible, to prevent <i>a
new War</i>, which he foresaw he should be very unfit to begin, or
carry on, and which they would never have dar'd to break had not
<i>this Feud</i> happen'd.</p>

<p>It was but a little before I came into this Country, when
<i>such repeated Accounts came</i>, of the Incroachments, Insults
and Preparations of their <i>great powerful Neighbour</i>, that all
the World saw the necessity of a War, and the very People <i>who
were to feel it most</i> apply'd to the Prince to begin it.</p>

<p>He was forward enough to begin it, and in compliance with his
People, resolv'd on it; but <i>the Grief</i> of the usage he had
receiv'd, the unkind Treatment he had met with from those very
People that brought him thither, had <i>sunk so</i> deep upon his
Spirits, that he could never recover it; but being very weak in
Body and Mind, and join'd to a slight hurt he receiv'd by a fall
from his Horse, <i>he dyed</i>, to the unspeakable grief of all his
Subjects that wish'd well to their Native Country.</p>

<p>This was the melancholly Account of this great Prince's end, and
I have been told that at once every Year, there is a kind <i>of
Fast</i>, or solemn Commemoration kept up for the Murther of that
former Prince, who, as I noted, <i>was Beheaded by his
Subjects</i>; So it seems some of the People, who are of Opinion
this Prince was Murther'd by the ill Treatment of his Friends, a
way which I must own, <i>is the cruellest of Deaths</i>, keep the
same Day, to commemorate his Death, and this is a Day, in which it
seems <i>both Parties are very free with one another, as to Rallery
and ill Language</i>.</p>

<p>But the Friends of this last Prince have a double advantage, for
they also commemorate the Birth Day of this Prince, and are
generally very merry on that Day; and the custom is at their Feast
on that Day, just like our drinking Healths, they pledge one
another <i>to the immortal Memory of their Deliverer</i>; as the
Historical part of this Matter was absolutely necessary to
introduce the following Remarks, and to instruct the Ignorant in
those things, I hope it <i>shall not be thought a barren
Digression</i>, especially when I shall tell you that it is a most
exact Representation of what is yet to come in a Scene of Affairs,
of which I must make a short Abstract, by way of Introduction.</p>

<p>The deceas'd Prince we have heard of, was succeeded by his
Sister in-Law, the second Daughter of the banish'd Prince, a Lady
of <i>an extraordinary Character</i>, of the Old Race of their
Kings, <i>a Native</i> by Birth, <i>a Solunarian</i> by Profession;
exceeding <i>Pious</i>, <i>Just</i> and <i>Good</i>, of an
<i>Honesty</i> peculiar to her self, and for which she was justly
belov'd of all sorts and degrees of her Subjects.</p>

<p>This Princess having the Experience of her <i>Father</i> and
<i>Grand-father</i> before her, join'd to her own Prudence and
Honesty of Design; it was no wonder if she prudently shun'd all
manner of <i>rash Counsels</i>, and endeavour'd to carry it with a
steady Hand between her contending Parties.</p>

<p>At her first coming to the Crown, she made <i>a solemn
Declaration</i> of her resolutions for <i>Peace</i> and just
Government; she gave the <i>Crolians</i> her Royal Word, that she
would inviolably preserve the <i>Toleration of their Religion and
Worship</i>, and always afford them <i>her Protection</i>, and by
this she hop'd they would <i>be easy</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>to the Solunarians</i>, as those among whom she had been
Educated, and whose Religion she had always profess'd, been train'd
up in, and Piously persued; she express'd her self <i>with an
uncommon Tenderness</i>, told them they should be the Men of her
Favour, and those that were <i>most zealous</i> for that Church
should have most of her Countenance; and she back'd this soon after
with an unparallel'd Act of Royal Bounty to them, freely parting
with a considerable Branch <i>of her Royal Revenue</i>, for the
<i>poor Priests</i> of that Religion, of which there were many in
the remote Parts of her Kingdom.</p>

<p>What vast Consequences, and prodigiously differing from the
Design, may Words have when mistaken and misayplyed by the Hearers.
Never were significant Expressions spoken from a sincere, honest
and generous Principle, with a single Design to ingage all the
Subjects in <i>the Moon</i>, to Peace and Union, so perverted,
misapply'd and turn'd by a Party, to a meaning directly contrary to
the Royal Thoughts of the Queen: For from this very Expression,
<i>most Zealous</i>, grew all the Divisions and Subdivisions in the
<i>Solunarian Church</i>, to the Ruin of their own Cause, and the
vast advantage of the <i>Crolian</i> Interest. The eager Men of the
Church, especially those we have been talking of, <i>hastily
catch'd</i> at this Expression of the Queen, <i>Most Zealous</i>,
and Millions of fatal Constructions, and unhappy Consequences they
made of it, some of which are as follows.</p>

<p>1. <i>They took it to imply</i> that the Queen whatever she had
said to <i>the Crolians</i>, really design'd <i>their
Destruction</i>, and that those that were of that Opinion, must be
meant by the <i>Most Zealous</i> Members of the <i>Solunarian</i>
Church, and they could understand <i>Zeal</i> no otherwise than
their <i>own way</i>.</p>

<p>2. From this Speech, and their mistaking the Words <i>Most
Zealous</i>, arose an unhappy Distinction among the
<i>Solunarians</i> themselves, some <i>Zealous</i>, some <i>More
Zealous</i>, which afterwards divided them into two most opposite
Parties, being fomented by an accident of a Book publish'd <i>on an
Occasion</i>, of which presently.</p>

<p>The Consequences of this mistake, appear'd presently in the
<i>Most Zealous</i>, in their offering all possible Insults to the
<i>Crolian Dissenters</i>, Preaching them down, <i>Printing</i>
them down, and <i>Talking</i> them down, as a People not fit to be
suffer'd <i>in the Nation</i>, and now they thought they had the
Game sure.</p>

<p>Down with the <i>Crolians</i> began to be all the Cry, and truly
the <i>Crolians themselves</i> began to be uneasy, and had nothing
to rely upon <i>but the Queens Promise</i>, which however her
Majesty always made good to them.</p>

<p>The other Party proceeded so far, that they begun to Insult
<i>the very Queen her self</i>, upon the Matter of her Word, and
one of her College-Priests told her plainly in Print, she could not
be a true Friend to <i>the Solunarian Church</i>, if she did not
declare War against, and root out all the <i>Crolians</i> in her
Dominions.</p>

<p>But these Proceedings met <i>with a Check</i>, by a very odd
accident: A certain <i>Author</i> of those Countries, a <i>very
mean, obscure and despicable Fellow</i>, of no great share of Wit,
but that had a very <i>unlucky way of telling his Story</i>, seeing
which way things were a going, writes a Book, and <i>Personating
this high Solunarian Zeal</i>, musters up all their Arguments,
<i>as if</i> they were his own, and strenuously pretends to prove
that <i>all the Crolians</i> ought to be Destroy'd, <i>Hang'd</i>,
<i>Banish'd</i>, and the D----l and all. As this Book was a perfect
Surprize to all the Country, so the Proceedings about it on all
sides were as extraordinary.</p>

<p>The <i>Crolians</i> themselves were surpriz'd at it, and so
closely had the Author couch'd his Design, that they never saw
<i>the irony of the Stile</i>, but began to look about them, to see
which way they should fly to save themselves.</p>

<p><i>The Men of Zeal</i> we talk'd of, were so blinded with the
Notion which <i>suited so exactly with their real Design</i>, that
they hugg'd the Book, <i>applauded the unknown Author</i>, and
plac'd the Book next their <i>Oraclar Writings</i>, or Laws of
Religion.</p>

<p>The Author was all this while conceal'd, and the Paper had all
the effect he wish'd for.</p>

<p>For as it caus'd <i>these first</i> Gentlemen to caress, applaud
and approve it, and thereby discover'd their real Intention, so it
met with Abhorrence and Detestation in all the Men of
<i>Principles</i>, <i>Prudence</i> and <i>Moderation</i> in the
Kingdom, who tho' they were <i>Solunarians</i> in Religion, yet
were not for Blood, Desolation and Persecution of their Brethren,
but <i>with the Queen</i> were willing they should enjoy their
Liberties and Estates, they behaving themselves <i>quietly and
peaceably</i> to the Government.</p>

<p>At last it came out that it was writ by <i>a Crolian</i>; but
<i>good God</i>! what a Clamour was rais'd at the poor Man, the
<i>Crolians</i> flew at him like Lightning, <i>ignorantly and
blindly</i>, not seeing that he had sacrific'd himself and his
Fortunes in their behalf; they <i>rumag'd his Character</i> for
Reproaches, tho' they could find little that way to hurt him; they
plentifully loaded him with ill Language and Railing, and took a
great deal of pains to let the World see their <i>own Ignorance and
Ingratitude</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Ministers of State</i>, tho' at that time <i>of the fiery
Party</i>, yet seeing the general Detestation of such a Proposal,
and how ill <i>it would go down with the Nation</i>, tho' they
approv'd the thing, yet began to scent the Design, and were also
oblig'd to declare against it, for fear of being thought of the
same Mind.</p>

<p>Thus the Author was Proscrib'd by Proclamation, and a
<i>Reward</i> of 50000 <i>Hecato's</i>, a small imaginary Coin in
those Parts, put upon his Head.</p>

<p>The <i>Cortez</i> of the Nation being at the same time assembled
join'd in Censuring the Book, and thus <i>the Party</i> blindly
damn'd <i>their own Principles</i> for meer shame of the practice,
not daring to own the thing in publick which they had underhand
profest, and the fury of all Parties fell <i>upon the poor
Author</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Man fled the first popular Fury</i>, but at last being
betraid fell into the Hands of the publick Ministry.</p>

<p>When they <i>had him</i> they hardly knew <i>what to do with
him</i>; they could not proceed against him as Author of a Proposal
for the Destruction of <i>the Crolians</i> because it appear'd he
was <i>a Crolian himself</i>; they were loth to charge him with
suggesting that the <i>Solunarian Church-men</i> were guilty of
such a Design, least he should bring <i>their own Writings to prove
it true</i>; so they fell to <i>wheadling him</i> with good Words
to throw himself into their Hands and submit, giving him that
<i>Geu-gau</i> the <i>Publick Faith</i> for a Civil and
Gentleman-like Treatment; the Man, believing <i>like a Coxcomb</i>
that they spoke as they meant, <i>quitted his own Defence</i>, and
threw himself on the Mercy <i>of the Queen as he thought</i>; but
they abusing their Queen with false Representations, <i>Perjur'd
all their Promises</i> with him, and treated him in a most
barbarous manner, on pretence that there were <i>no such Promises
made</i>, tho' he prov'd it upon them by the Oath of the Persons to
whom they were made.</p>

<p>Thus they laid him under <i>a heavy Sentence</i>, Fin'd him more
than they thought him able to pay, and order'd him to be expos'd to
the Mob in the Streets.</p>

<p>Having him at this Advantage they set upon him with their
Emissaries to discover to them his Adherents, <i>as they call'd
them</i>, and promis'd him great Things on one Hand, threatning him
<i>with his utter Ruin</i> on the other; and the <i>Great
Scribe</i> of the Country, with another of their great Courtiers,
took such a low Step as to go to him <i>to the Dungeon</i> where
they had put him, to see if they could tempt him <i>to betray his
Friends</i>. The <i>Comical Dialogue</i> between them there the
Author of this has seen <i>in Manuscript</i>, exceeding
<i>diverting</i>, but having not time to Translate it 'tis omitted
for the present; tho' he promises to <i>publish it in its proper
Season</i> for publick Instruction.</p>

<p>However for the present it may suffice to tell the World, that
neither by <i>promises of Reward or fear of Punishment</i> they
could prevail upon him to discover any thing, and so it remains a
Secret to this day.</p>

<p>The Title of this unhappy Book was <i>The shortest way with the
Crolians</i>. The Effects of it were various, as will be seen in
our ensuing Discourse: As to the Author nothing was more
unaccountable than the Circumstances of his Treatment; for he met
with all <i>that Fate</i> which they must expect <i>who attempt to
open the Eyes of a Nation wilfully blind</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>hot Men of the Solunarian Church</i> damn'd him without
<i>Bell</i>, <i>Book</i>, or <i>Candle</i>; the more
<i>Moderate</i> pitied him, but lookt on as unconcern'd: <i>But the
Crolians</i>, for whom he had run this Venture, us'd him worst of
all; for they not only abandon'd him, but <i>reproacht him as an
Enemy</i> that would ha' them destroy'd: So one side rail'd at him
because they <i>did understand</i> him, and the other because
<i>they did not</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the Man sunk under the general Neglect, was ruin'd and
undone, and left a Monument of what every Man must expect that
serves a good Cause, <i>profest</i> by an <i>unthankful
People</i>.</p>

<p>And here it was I found out that my Lunar Philosopher was
<i>only so</i> in Disguise, and that <i>he was no Philosopher, but
the very Man</i> I have been talking of.</p>

<p><i>From this Book</i>, and the Treatment its Author receiv'd,
for they us'd him with all possible Rigour, a new Scene of Parties
came upon the Stage, and this Queen's Reign began to be fill'd with
more Divisions and Feuds than any before her.</p>

<p><i>These Parties</i> began to be so numerous and violent that
<i>it endanger'd the Publick Good</i>, and gave great Disadvantages
to the general Affairs abroad.</p>

<p>The Queen invited them all to <i>Peace and Union</i>, but 'twas
in vain; nay, one had the Impudence to publish that to procure
Peace and Union it was necessary to suppress <i>all the
Crolians</i>, and have no Party but one, and then all must be of a
Mind.</p>

<p>From this heat of Parties all the moderate Men fell in with
their Queen, and were heartily <i>for Peace and Union:</i> The
other, who were now distinguish'd by the Title of <i>High
Solunarians</i>, call'd these all <i>Crolians</i> and <i>Low
Solunarians</i>, and began to Treat them with more Inveteracy than
they us'd to do the <i>Crolians</i> themselves, calling them
<i>Traytors</i> to their Country, <i>Betrayers</i> of their Mother,
<i>Serpents</i> harbour'd in the Bosom, who bite, sting and hiss at
the Hand that succour'd them; and in short the Enmity grew so
violent, that from hence proceeded one of the <i>subtilest,
foolishest, deep, shallow</i> Contrivances and <i>Plots</i> that
ever was hatcht or set on foot by any Party of Men in the whole
Moon, at least who pretended <i>to any Brains</i>, or to half a
degree <i>of common</i> Understanding.</p>

<p>There had always been Dislikes and Distasts between even the
most moderate <i>Solunarians</i> and the <i>Crolians</i>, as I have
noted in the beginning of this Relation, and these were deriv'd
from <i>Dissenting in Opinions of Religion</i>, ancient Feuds,
private Interest, Education, and the like; and the
<i>Solunarians</i> had frequently, on pretence of securing the
Government, made Laws to exclude the <i>Crolians</i> from any part
of the Administration, unless they submitted to some <i>Religious
Tests</i> and Ceremonies which were prescrib'd them.</p>

<p>Now as <i>the keeping them out of Offices</i> was more the
Design than the <i>Conversion of the Crolians</i> to the
<i>Solunarian</i> Church, the <i>Crolians</i>, at least many of
them, <i>submitted to the Test</i>, and frequently Conform'd to
qualify themselves for publick Employments.</p>

<p><i>The most moderate of the Solunarians</i> were in their
Opinion against this practice, and the <i>High Men</i> taking
advantage of them, <i>drew them in</i> to Concur in making a Law
with yet more Severity against them, effectually to keep them out
of Employment.</p>

<p><i>The low Solunarians</i> were easy to be drawn into this
Project, as it was only a Confirming former Laws of their own
making, and all Things run fair <i>for the Design</i>; but as the
<i>High Men</i> had further Ends in it than barely reducing the
<i>Crolians</i> to Conformity, they coucht so many gross Clauses
into their Law, that even the <i>Grandees of the Solunarians</i>
themselves could not comply with; nay even the <i>Patriarchs</i> of
the <i>Solunarian</i> Church declar'd against it, as tending to
Persecution and Confusion.</p>

<p>This Disappointment <i>enrag'd the Party</i>, and that very Rage
entirely ruin'd their Project; for now the <i>Nobility</i>, the
<i>Patriarchs</i>, and all the wise Men of the Nation, joining
together against these <i>Men of Heat and Fury</i>, the Queen began
to see into their Designs, and <i>as she was of a most pious and
peaceable Temper</i>, she conceiv'd a just Hatred of so wicked and
barbarous a Design, and immediately dismiss'd from her Council and
Favour <i>the Great Scribe</i>, and several others who were Leaders
in the Design, <i>to the great mortification of the whole
Party</i>, and utter Ruin of the intended Law against <i>the
Crolians</i>.</p>

<p>Here I could not but observe, as I have done before in the Case
of the banish'd King, how <i>impolitick these high Solunarian
Church-men acted</i> in all their Proceedings, for had they
contented themselves <i>by little and little</i> to ha' done their
Work, they had done it effectually; but pushing at Extremities they
overshot themselves, and <i>ruin'd all</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>the Grandees</i> and <i>Patriarchs</i> made but a <i>few
trifling Objections</i> at first, nay and came off, and yielded
some of them too; and if these would ha' consented to ha' parted
with some Clauses which they have willingly left out since, they
had had it pass'd; but these were <i>as hot Men always are</i>, too
eager and sure of their Game, they thought all was their own, and
so they lost themselves.</p>

<p>If they rail'd at the <i>low Solunarian Church-men</i> before,
they doubled their Clamors at them now, all the <i>Patriarchs</i>,
and all the Nobility and <i>Grandees</i>, nay even the <i>Queen</i>
her self came under their Censure, and every Body who was not of
their Mind were <i>Prestarians</i> and <i>Crolians</i>.</p>

<p>As this Rage of theirs was implacable, so, as I hinted before,
it drove them into another <i>Subdivision of Parties</i>, and now
began <i>the Mysterious Plot</i> to be laid which I mention'd
before; for the <i>Cortez</i> being summon'd, and the Law being
proposed, some of these <i>high Solunarians</i> appear'd in
Confederacy with the <i>Crolians, in perfect Confederacy</i> with
them, a thing no Body would have imagin'd could ever ha' been
brought to pass.</p>

<p>Now as these sorts of Plots must always be carry'd very nicely,
so these <i>high Gentlemen</i> who Confederated with the
<i>Crolians</i>, having, to spight the other, resolv'd effectually
to prevent the passing the Law against <i>the Qualification of the
Crolians</i>, it was not their Business immediately to declare
themselves <i>against</i> it as a Law, but by still loading it with
some Extravagance or other, and pushing it on to some intolerable
Extreme, <i>secure its miscarriage</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the managing this Plot</i>, one of their Authors was
specially employ'd, and <i>that all that was really true of the</i>
Crolian Dissenters might be ridicul'd, his Work was to draw
<i>monstrous Pictures</i> of them, which no Body could believe;
this took immediately, for now People began to look at their Shooes
to see if they were not <i>Cloven Footed</i> as they went a long
Streets; and at last finding they were really shap'd like the rest
<i>of the Lunar Inhabitants</i>, they went back <i>to the
Author</i>, who was a Learned Member of a certain Seminary, or
Brother-hood of <i>the Solunarian Clergy</i>, and enquir'd if he
were <i>not Mad</i>, Distracted and <i>Raving</i>, or
<i>Moon-blind</i>, and in want of the thinking Engine; but finding
all things <i>right there</i>, and that he was in his Senses,
especially in a Morning when he was a little <i>free from</i>,
&amp;c. that he was a Good, Honest, Jolly, <i>Solunarian
Priest</i>, and no room could be found for an Objection there. Upon
all these Searches it presently appear'd, and all Men concluded it
was a meer <i>Fanatick Crolian Plot</i>; that this <i>High Party of
all</i> were but Pretenders, and meer Traytors to the <i>True High
Solunarian Church-Men</i>, that wearing the same Cloth had herded
among them <i>in Disguise</i>, only to wheedle them into such wild
Extravagancies as must of necessity confuse their Councils, expose
their Persons, and ruin their Cause. ---- According to the like
Practice, put upon their <i>Abrograzian</i> Prince, and of which I
have spoken before.</p>

<p>And since I am upon the detection of this <i>most refin'd
Practice</i>, I crave leave to descend to some particular
Instances, which will the better evince the Truth of this Matter,
and make it appear that either this was really <i>a Crolian
Plot</i>, or else all these People were <i>perfectly
Distracted</i>; and as their Wits in <i>that Lunar World</i>, are
much higher strain'd <i>than ours</i>, so their Lunacy, where it
happens, must according to the Rules <i>of Mathematical Nature</i>,
bear an extream Equal in proportion.</p>

<p><i>This College Fury of a Man</i> was the first on whom this
useful Discovery was made, and having <i>writ several Learned
Tracts</i> wherein he invited the People <i>to Murther</i> and
Destroy <i>all the Crolians</i>, Branded all the <i>Solunarian
Patriarchs</i>, <i>Clergy</i> and <i>Gentry</i> that would not come
into <i>his Proposal</i>, with the name of <i>Cowards</i>,
<i>Traytors</i> and <i>Betrayers</i> of <i>Lunar Religion</i>;
having beat the <i>Concionazimir</i> at a great Assembly of the
Cadirs, or <i>Judges</i>, and told them <i>all the Crolians</i>
were <i>Devils</i>, and they were <i>all Perjur'd</i> that did not
use them as such: He carry'd on Matters <i>so dexterously</i>, and
with such surprizing Success, that he fill'd even <i>the
Solunarians</i> themselves with Horror at his Proposals.----- And
as I happen'd to be in one of their publick Halls where all such
Writings <i>as are new</i> are laid a certain time to be read by
<i>every Comer</i>, I saw a little <i>knot of Men</i> round a
Table, where one was reading <i>this Book</i>.</p>

<p>There were two <i>Solunarian High Priests</i> in their proper
Vestments, one <i>Privy Councellor</i> of the State, one other
<i>Noble Man</i>, and one who had <i>in his Hat</i> a Token, to
signifie that he possest one of the <i>fine Feathers</i> of the
<i>Consolidator</i>, of which I have given the Description
already.</p>

<p><i>The Book being read</i> by one of the habited Priests, he
starts up with some warmth, <i>by the Moon, says he</i>, I have
<i>found this Fellow out</i>, he is certainly a <i>Crolian</i>, a
meer <i>Prestarian Crolian</i>, and is crept into our Church only
<i>in Disguise</i>, for 'tis certain all this is <i>but meer
Banter</i> and Irony to expose us, and to ridicule the
<i>Solunarian</i> Interest.</p>

<p><i>The Privy Councellor</i> took it presently, whether he is
<i>a Crolian</i> or no, says he, I cannot tell, but he has
certainly <i>done the Crolians so much Service</i>, that if they
had hir'd him to act for them, they could not have desir'd he
should serve them better.</p>

<p>Truly, says <i>the Man of the Feather</i>, I was always for
pulling down <i>the Crolians</i>, for I thought them dangerous to
the State; but this Man has brought the Matter <i>nearer to my
View</i>, and shown me <i>what destroying them is</i>, for he put
me upon examining the Consequences, and now I find it would be
<i>lopping off the Limbs of the Government</i>, and laying it at
the Mercy of the Enemy <i>that they might lop off its Head</i>; I
assure you he has done <i>the Crolians</i> great Service, for
whereas abundance of our Men <i>of the Feather</i> were for routing
the <i>Crolians</i>, they lately fell down to 134 or
thereabouts.</p>

<p>All this confirm'd the first Man's Opinion that <i>he was a
Crolian in Disguise</i>, or an Emissary employ'd by them to ruin
the Project of their Enemies; for <i>these Crolians are damn'd
cunning People in their way</i>, and they have Mony enough to
engage Hirelings to their side.</p>

<p>Another Party concern'd in <i>this Plot</i> was an old
<i>cast-out Solunarian Priest</i>, who, tho' professing himself a
<i>Solunarian</i>, was turn'd out for adhering to the
<i>Abrograzian King</i>, a mighty Stickler for the Doctrin of
<i>absolute Subjection</i>.</p>

<p>This Man draws <i>the most monstrous Picture of a Crolian</i>
that could be invented, he put him in a <i>Wolf's Skin</i> with
long <i>Asses Ears</i>, and hung him all over full of
<i>Associations</i>, <i>Massacres</i>, <i>Persecutions</i>,
<i>Rebellions</i>, and <i>Blood</i>. Here the People began to
<i>stare</i> again, and a <i>Crolian</i> cou'd not go along the
Street but they were alway's looking for the <i>long Ears</i>, the
<i>Wolf's Claws</i>, and the like; 'till at last nothing of these
Things appearing, but the <i>Crolians</i> looking and acting like
<i>other Folks</i>, they begun to examine the Matter, and found
this was <i>a meer Crolian Plot</i> too, and <i>this Man</i> was
hir'd to run these extravagant lengths to point out the right
meaning.</p>

<p><i>The Discovery being made</i>, People ever since understand
him that when he talks of the Dissenters <i>Associations</i>,
<i>Murthers</i>, <i>Persecutions</i>, and the like, he means that
his Readers should look back to the <i>Murthers</i>,
<i>Oppressions</i> and <i>Persecutions</i> they had suffered for
several past years, and the <i>Associations</i> that were now
forming to bring them into the same Condition again.</p>

<p>From this famous Author I could not but proceed to observe the
farther Progress of this most refin'd piece of Cunning, among the
<i>very great Ones</i>, <i>Grandees</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, and
<i>Consolidators</i> of the Country. For these <i>Cunning
Crolians</i> manag'd their Intriegues so nicely, that they brought
about a Famous Division even among the <i>High Solunarian Party
themselves</i>; and whereas the Law of Qualification was reviv'd
again, and in great Danger of being compleated; these subtle
<i>Crolians</i> brought over One Hundred and Thirty Four <i>of the
Feathers</i> in the Famous <i>Consolidator</i> to be of their side,
and to <i>Contrive the utter Destruction of it</i>; <i>and thus
fell the Design</i> which the <i>High Solunarian</i> Church Men had
laid for the Ruin of <i>the Crolians Interest</i>, by their own
Friends first joyning in all the Extremes they had proposed, and
then pushing it so much farther, and to such <i>mad Periods</i>
that the very highest of them <i>stood amaz'd</i> at the Design,
<i>startled, flew back</i> and made a <i>full stop</i>; they were
willing to Ruin the <i>Crolians</i>, but they were not willing to
Ruin the whole Nation. The more these Men began to consider, the
more furiously these Plotters carry'd on their Extravagances; at
last they made <i>a General push</i> at a thing in which they knew
if the other <i>High Men</i> joyn'd, they must throw <i>all into
Confusion</i>, bring a <i>Foreign Enemy</i> on their Backs,
<i>unravel all the Thread of the War</i>, fight all their Victories
<i>back again</i>, and involve the whole Nation in <i>Blood</i> and
<i>Confusion</i>.</p>

<p>They knew well enough that most of the <i>High Men</i> would
hesitate at this, they knew if they did not the <i>Grandees</i> and
<i>Patriarchs</i> would reject it, and so they plaid the <i>surest
Game</i> to blast and overthrow this Law, that could possibly be
plaid.</p>

<p>If any Man, <i>in the whole World in the Moon</i>, will pretend
this was not <i>a Plot</i>, a <i>Crolian Design</i>, a meer
<i>Conspiracy to destroy the Law</i>, let him tell me for what
other end could these Men offer such extreams as they needs must
know would meet with immediate opposition, things that they knew
all the Honest Men, all the <i>Grandees</i>, all the
<i>Patriarchs</i>, and almost all the <i>Feathers</i> would
oppose.</p>

<p>From hence all the Men of any fore-sight brought it to this
pass, as is before Noted, that either these One Hundred and Thirty
Four were <i>Fools</i> or <i>Mad-Men</i>, or that it was a
<i>Phanatick Crolian Plot</i> and Conspiracy to Ruin the makeing
this Law, which the rest of the <i>Solunarian Church Men</i> were
very forward to carry on.</p>

<p>I heard indeed some Men Argue that this could not be, the breach
was too wide between <i>the Crolians</i> and these Gentlemen ever
to come to such an Agreement; but <i>the Wiser Heads</i> who argu'd
the other way, always brought them, as is noted above, to this
pinch of Argument; that either it must be so, <i>be a Fanatick
Crolian Plot</i>, or else the <i>Men of Fury</i> were all
<i>Fools</i>, <i>Madmen</i>, and fitter for an <i>Hospital</i>,
than a State-House, or a <i>Pulpit</i>.</p>

<p>It must be allow'd, these <i>Crolians</i> were Cunning People,
thus to wheedle in these <i>High Flying Solunarians</i> to break
the Neck of their dear Project.</p>

<p>But upon the whole, for ought I cou'd see, whether it went one
way or t'other, all the Nation esteem'd the other People <i>Fools
------ Fools of the most extraordinary</i> Size <i>in all the Moon,
for either way</i> they pull'd down what they had been many Years a
Building.</p>

<p>I cannot say that this was in kindness to the <i>Crolians</i>,
but in meer Malice to the <i>Low Solunarian Party</i>, who had the
Government in their Hands, for <i>Malice always carries Men on to
monstrous Extremes</i>.</p>

<p>Some indeed have thought it hard to call this a Plot, and a
Confederacy <i>with the Crolians</i>.------ But I cannot but think
it the <i>kindest thing that can be said of them</i>, and that 'tis
impossible those People who push'd at some imaginary Things in
<i>that Law</i> could but be in a Plot as aforesaid, or be
perfectly <i>Lunatick</i>, down right Mad-Men, or Traytors to their
Country, <i>and let them choose which Character they like</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot in Charity but spare them their <i>Honesty</i>, and
their <i>Senses</i>, and attribute it all to their Policy.</p>

<p>When I had understood all things at large, and found the
exceeding depth of the Design; I must confess the Discovery of
these things <i>was very diverting</i>, and the more so, when I
made the proper Reflections upon the <i>Analogy there seem'd to
be</i> between <i>these Solunarian High Church-Men</i> in the Moon,
and ours here in <i>England</i>; <i>our High Church-Men</i> are no
more to compare to <i>these</i>, than the Hundred and Thirty Four,
are to the <i>Consolidators</i>.</p>

<p>Ours can Plot now and then a little among themselves, but then
'tis all <i>Gross</i> and <i>plain Sailing</i>, down right
<i>taking Arms</i>, calling in Foreign Forces,
<i>Assassinations</i> and <i>the like</i>; but these are nothing to
the more Exquisite Heads in <i>the Moon</i>. For they have the
subtillest Ways with them, that ever were heard of. They can
<i>make War</i> with a Prince, on purpose to <i>bring him to the
Crown</i>; fit out <i>vast Navies against him</i>, that he may have
the more leisure <i>to take their Merchant Men</i>; make
<i>Descents</i> upon him, on purpose to come Home and do
<i>nothing</i>; if they have a mind to a Sea Fight, they carefully
send out Admirals that care not to come within half a Mile of the
Enemy, that coming off safe they may have <i>the boasting Part</i>
of the Victory, and <i>the beaten Part both together</i>.</p>

<p>'Twould be endless to call over the Roll of their sublime
Politicks. They <i>damn Moderation in order to Peace and Union</i>,
set the House <i>on Fire</i> to save it from <i>Desolation</i>,
Plunder to avoid Persecution, and <i>consolidate Things</i> in
order to their more <i>immediate Dissolution</i>.</p>

<p>Had our <i>High Church-Men</i> been Masters of these excellent
Arts, they had long ago brought their Designs to pass.</p>

<p>The exquisite Plot of these <i>High Solunarians</i> answer'd the
<i>Crolians End</i>, for it broke all their Enemies Measures, the
Law vanish'd, the Grandees could hardly be perswaded to read it,
and when it was propos'd to be read again, <i>they hist at it</i>,
and threw it by with Contempt.</p>

<p>Nor was this all; for it not only lost them their Design as to
this Law, but it also absolutely broke the Party, and just as it
was with <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>, as soon as <i>they Sinn'd</i>
they <i>Quarrell'd</i>, and fell out with one another; so, as soon
as things came to this height, <i>the Party fell out one among
another</i>, and even the <i>High Men</i> themselves were divided,
some were for <i>Consolidating</i>, and some not for
<i>Consolidating</i>, some were for <i>Tacking</i>, and some not
for <i>Tacking</i>, as they were, or were not let into the
Secret.</p>

<p>If this <i>Confusion of Languages</i>, or Interest, lost them
the real Design, it cannot be a wonder; have we not always seen it
<i>in our World</i>, that dividing an Interest, weakens and exposes
it? Has not a great many both good and bad Designs been render'd
Abortive in <i>this our Lower World</i>, for want of <i>the Harmony
of Parties</i>, and the Unanimity of those concern'd in the
Design?</p>

<p>How had the <i>knot of Rebellion</i> been dissolv'd in
<i>England</i>, if it had not been untied by the very Hands <i>of
those that knit it</i>? All the contrary Force had been entirely
broken and subdu'd, and the <i>Restoration of Monarchy</i> had
never happen'd in <i>England</i>, if <i>Union and Agreement</i> had
been found among the managers of that Age.</p>

<p>The Enemies of the present Establishment have shown sufficiently
that they perfectly understand the <i>shortest way</i> to our
infallible Destruction, when they bend their principle Force at
dividing us into Parties, and keeping those parties at the utmost
variance.</p>

<p><i>But this is not all</i>, the Author of this cannot but
observe here that as <i>England</i> is unhappily divided among
Parties, so it has this one Felicity even to be found in the very
matter of her Misfortunes, that those Parties are all again
subdivided among themselves.</p>

<p>How easily might the Church have crusht and subdu'd the
Dissenters if they had been all as mad as one Party, if they had
not been <i>some High</i> and <i>some Low</i> Church-men. And what
Mischief might not that one Party ha' done in this Nation, had not
they been divided again into <i>Jurant Jacobites</i> and
<i>Non-Jurant</i>, into <i>Consolidators</i> and
<i>Non-Consolidators</i>? From whence 'tis plain to me, that
<i>just as it is in the Moon</i> these <i>Consolidating
Church-men</i> are meer Confederates with the <i>Whigs</i>; and it
must be so, unless we should suppose them meer <i>mad Men</i> that
don't know what they are a doing, and who are the Drudges of their
Enemies, and kno' nothing of the Matter.</p>

<p>And from this <i>Lunar Observation</i> it presently occur'd to
my Understanding, that <i>my Masters the Dissenters</i> may come in
for a share among the <i>Moon-blind</i> Men of this Generation,
since had they done for their own Interest what the <i>Laws fairly
admits to</i> be done, had they been <i>united among
themselves</i>, had they form'd themselves into a <i>Politick
Body</i> to have acted in a publick, united Capacity <i>by general
Concert</i>, and as Persons that had but one Interest <i>and
understood it</i>, they had never been so often Insulted by every
rising Party, they had never had so many <i>Machines</i> and
<i>Intrigues to ruin and suppress them</i>, they had never been so
often <i>Tackt</i> and <i>Consolidated</i> to Oppression and
Persecution, and yet never have rebell'd or broke the Peace,
incurr'd the Displeasure of their Princes, or have been upbraided
with Plots, Insurrections and <i>Antimonarchical Principles</i>;
when they had made Treaties and Capitulations with the Church
<i>for Temper</i> and <i>Toleration</i>, the Articles would have
been kept, and these would have demanded Justice with an Authority
that would upon all Occasions <i>be respected</i>.</p>

<p>Were they united in <i>Civil Polity</i> in <i>Trade</i> and
<i>Interest</i>, would they <i>Buy and Sell</i> with <i>one
another</i>, abstract their <i>Stocks</i>, erect <i>Banks</i> and
<i>Companies</i> in Trade <i>of their own</i>, lend their Cash to
the Government <i>in a Body</i>, and as a <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>If I were to tell them what Advantages the <i>Crolians</i> in
the <i>Moon</i> make of this sort of management, how the Government
finds it their Interest to treat them civilly, and use them like
Subjects of Consideration; how upon all Occasions some of the
<i>Grandees</i> and <i>Nobility</i> appear as Protectors of the
<i>Crolians</i>, and treat with their Princes in their Names,
present their Petitions, and make Demands from the Prince of such
Loans and <i>Sums of Mony</i> as the publick Occasions require; and
what abundance of Advantages are reapt from such a Union, both to
their own Body as a Party, and to the Government also they would be
convinc'd; wherefore I cannot but very earnestly desire of the
Dissenters and Whigs <i>in my own Country</i> that they would take
a Journy in my <i>Consolidator</i> up to the Moon, they would
certainly see there what vast Advantages they lose for want of a
<i>Spirit of Union</i>, and a concert of Measures among
themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>Crolians in the Moon</i> are Men of <i>large Souls</i>,
and Generously stand by one another <i>on all Occasions</i>; it was
never known that they deserted any Body that suffer'd for them,
<i>my Old Philosopher excepted</i>, and that was a surprize upon
them.</p>

<p>The Reason of the Difference is plain, our Dissenters here have
not the Advantage of <i>a Cogitator</i>, or <i>thinking Engine</i>,
as they have <i>in the Moon</i>.----- We have the <i>Elevator</i>
here and are lifted up pretty much, but <i>in the Moon</i> they
always go into the <i>Thinking Engine</i> upon every
<i>Emergency</i>, and in this they out-do us of this World on every
Occasion.</p>

<p>In general therefore I must note that the wisest Men I found
<i>in the Moon</i>, when they understood the Notes I had made as
above, of the sub-divisions of our Parties, told me that it was the
greatest Happiness that could ha' been obtained to our Country, for
that if our Parties had not been thus divided, <i>the Nation had
been undone</i>. They own'd that had not their <i>Solunarian
Party</i> been divided among themselves, the <i>Crolians</i> had
been undone, and all the <i>Moon</i> had been involv'd <i>in
Persecution</i>, and been very probably subjected to the
<i>Gallunarian Monarch</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>fatal Errors of Men</i> have their advantages, the
seperate ends they serve are not foreseen by their Authors and they
<i>do good</i> against the very <i>Design of the People</i>, and
the nature of the Evil it self.</p>

<p>And now that I may encourage <i>our People</i> to that Peace and
good Understanding among themselves, which can alone produce their
Safety and Deliverance; I shall give a brief Account how the
<i>Crolians in the Moon</i> came to open their Eyes to their own
Interest, how they came to <i>Unite</i>; and how the Fruits of
<i>that Union</i> secur'd them from ever being insulted again by
the <i>Solunarian Party</i>, who in time gave over the vain and
fruitless Attempt, and so a universal <i>Lunar Calm</i> has spread
the whole <i>Moon</i> ever since.</p>

<p>If <i>our People</i> will not listen to their own Advantages,
nor <i>do their own Business</i>, let them take the consequences to
themselves, they cannot blame the <i>Man in the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>To endeavour to bring this to pass, as these Memoirs have run
thro' the general History of the Feuds and unhappy Breaches between
the <i>Solunarian</i> Church and <i>the Crolian</i> Dissenters
<i>in the World of the Moon</i>, it would seem an imperfect and
abrupt Relation, if I should not tell you how, and by what Method,
<i>tho' long hid from their Eyes</i>, the <i>Crolians</i> came to
understand their own Interest and <i>know their own
Strength</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis true, it seem'd a Wonder to me when I consider'd the
Excellence and Variety of those <i>perspective Glasses</i> I have
mentioned, the clearness of the Air, and <i>consequently of the
Head</i>, in this Lunar World. I say it was very strange the
<i>Crolians</i> should ha' been <i>Moon Blind</i> so long as they
were, that they could not see it was always in their Power if they
had but pursued their own Interest, and made use of those, legal
Opportunities which lay before them, to put themselves in a
Posture, as that the Government it self should think them a Body
too big to be insulted, and find it their Interest to keep Measures
with them.</p>

<p>It was indeed a long time before they open'd their Eyes to these
advantages, but bore the Insults of the hair-brain'd Party, with a
weakness and negligence that was as unjustifiable in them, as
unaccountable to all the Nations of the Moon.</p>

<p>But at last, as all violent Extremes rouze <i>their contrary
Extremeties</i>, the folly and extravagance of the <i>High
Solunarians</i> drove the <i>Crolians</i> into their Senses, and
<i>rouz'd them</i> to their own Interest, the occasion was among a
great many others as follows.</p>

<p>The eager <i>Solunarian</i> could not on all occasions forbear
to show their deep Regret at the Dissenting <i>Crolians</i>
enjoying the Tolleration of their Religion, <i>by a Law</i>
---.</p>

<p>And when all their legal Attempts to lessen that Liberty had
prov'd Abortive, her <i>Solunarian Majesty</i> on all Occasions
repeating her assurances of the continuance of her Protection, and
particularly the maintaining this Tolleration Inviolable. They
proceeded then to show the remains of their Mallice, in <i>little
Insults</i>, mean and <i>illegal Methods</i>, and continual private
Disturbances upon particular Persons, in which, however the
<i>Crolians</i> having recourse to the Law, always found Justice on
their side, and had redress with Advantage, of which the following
Instance is more than ordinarily Remarkable.</p>

<p>There had been a Law made by <i>the Men of the Feather</i>, that
all the meaner Idle sort of People, who had no settel'd way of
living should go to the Wars, and the <i>Lazognians</i>, a sort of
Magistrates there, in the nature of our Justices of the Peace, were
to send them away by Force.</p>

<p>Now it happen'd in a certain <i>Solunarian Island</i>, that for
want of a better, one of their High Priests was put into the Civil
Administration, and made a <i>Lazognian</i>.----- In the
Neighbourhood of this Man's Jurisdiction, one of their own
<i>Solunarian Priests</i> had turn'd <i>Crolian</i>, and whether he
had a better Tallent at performance, or rather was more diligent in
his Office is not material, but he set up a kind of a
<i>Crolian</i> Temple in an old Barn, or some such Mechanick
Building, and all the People flock'd after him.</p>

<p>This so provok'd his Neighbours <i>of the black Girdle</i>, an
Order of Priests, of which he had been one, that they resolv'd to
suppress him let it cost what it would.</p>

<p>They run <i>strange lengths</i> to bring this to pass.</p>

<p><i>They forg'd strange Stories of him</i>, defam'd him, run him
into Jayl upon frivolous and groundless Occasions, represented him
as a <i>Monster of a Man</i>, told their Story <i>so plain</i>, and
made it <i>so specious</i>, that even <i>the Crolians</i>
themselves <i>to their Shame</i>, believ'd it, and took up
Prejudices against the Poor Man, which had like to ha' been his
Ruin.</p>

<p><i>They proscrib'd him in Print</i> for Crimes they could never
prove, <i>they branded him</i> with Forgery, Adultery, Drunkenness,
Swearing, breaking Jayl, and abundance of Crimes; but when Matters
were examin'd and things came to the Test, they could <i>never
prove the least thing upon him</i>.----- In this manner however
they continually worryed the poor Man, till they ruin'd his Family
and <i>reduc'd him to Beggary</i>; and tho' he came out of the
Prison they cast him into by the meer force of Innocence, yet they
never left persuing him with all sorts of violence.------ At last
they made use of their <i>Brother of the Girdle</i> who was in
Commission as above, and this Man being <i>High Priest</i> and
<i>Lazonian</i> too, by the <i>first</i> was a Party, and by the
<i>last</i> had a Power to act the Tragedy <i>they had plotted</i>
against the poor Man.</p>

<p><i>In short</i>, they seiz'd him without any Crime alledg'd,
took violently from him <i>his Licence, as a Crolian Priest</i>, by
which the Law justify'd what he had done, pretending it was forg'd,
and after very ill Treating him, <i>condemn'd him to the Wars</i>,
delivers him up for a Souldier, and accordingly carry'd him
away.</p>

<p>But it happen'd, to their great Mortification, that this Man
found more Mercy from the <i>Men of the Sword</i>, than from those
<i>of the Word</i>, and so found means to get out of their Hands,
and afterwards to undeceive all the Moon, both as to his own
Character, and as to what he had Suffer'd.</p>

<p>For some of the <i>Crolians</i>, who began to be made sensible
of the Injury done the poor Man, advis'd him to have recourse to
the Law, and to bring his Adversaries before <i>the Criminal
Bar</i>.</p>

<p>But as soon as this was done, <i>good God!</i> what a <i>Scene
of Villainy</i> was here opened: The poor Man brought up such a
Cloud of Witnesses to confront every Article of their Charge, and
to vindicate his own Character, that when the very Judges heard it,
tho' they were all <i>Solunarians</i> themselves, they held up
their Hands, and declar'd in open Court it was the <i>deepest Track
of Villany</i> that ever came before them, and that the Actors
ought to be made Examples to <i>all the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>The Persons concern'd, us'd all possible Arts to avoid, or at
least to delay the Shame, and adjourn the Punishment, thinking
still to weary the poor Man out.------ But now his Brethren the
<i>Crolians</i> began to see themselves wounded thro' his Sides,
and above all, finding his Innocence clear'd up beyond all manner
of dispute, <i>they espous'd his Cause</i>, and assisted him to
prosecute his Enemies, which he did, till he brought them all to
Justice, expos'd them to the last Degree, obtain'd the reparation
of all his Losses, and a publick Decree of the Judges of his
Justification <i>and future Repose</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed when I saw the Proceedings against this poor Man run to a
heighth so extravagant and monstrous, when I found <i>Malice</i>,
<i>Forgery</i>, <i>Subornation</i>, <i>Perjury</i>, and a thousand
unjustifiable Things which their own Sense, if they had any, might
ha' been their Protection against, and which any Child <i>in the
Moon</i> might ha' told them must one time or other <i>come upon
the Stage</i> and expose them; I began to think these People were
all in <i>the Crolian Plot</i> too.</p>

<p>For really such Proceedings as these were the greatest pieces of
Service to <i>the Crolians</i> as could possibly be done; for as it
generally proves in other Places as well as in the Moon, that
<i>Mischief unjustly contriv'd</i> falls upon the Head of the
Authors, and redounds to their treble Dishonour, so it was here;
the barbarity and inhumane Treatment of this Man, made the sober
and honest Part even of the <i>Solanarians</i> themselves blush for
their Brethren, and own that the Punishment awarded on them was
just.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Crolians</i> got ground by the Folly and Madness of
their Enemies, and the very Engines and Plots laid to injure them,
serv'd to bring their Enemies on the Stage, and expose both them
and their Cause.</p>

<p><i>But this was not all</i>, by these incessant Attacks on them
as a Party, they began to come <i>to their Senses</i> out of a 50
Year slumber, they found the Law on their side, and the Government
Moderate and Just; they found they might <i>oppose Violence with
Law</i>, and that when they did fly to the Refuge of Justice, they
always had the better of their Enemy; flusht with this Success, it
put them upon considering <i>what Fools they had been</i> all along
to bear the Insolence of a few hot-headed Men, who contrary to the
true Intent and Meaning of the Queen, or of the Government, <i>had
resolv'd their Destruction</i>.</p>

<p>It put them upon revolving the State of their own Case, <i>and
comparing it with their Enemies</i>; upon Examining on what foot
they stood, and tho' Establish'd upon a firm Law, yet a violent
Party <i>pushing at the overthrow of that Establishment</i>, and
dissolving the legal Right they had to their Liberty and Religion;
it put them upon duly weighing the nearness of their approaching
Ruin and Destruction, and finding things run so hard against them,
reflecting upon the Extremity of their Affairs, and how if they had
not drawn in the High Church-Champions to <i>damn the Projects</i>
of their own Party, by running at such desperate Extremes as all
Men of any Temper must of course abhor, they had been undone;
<i>truly now they began to consider</i>, and to consult with one
another <i>what was to be done</i>.</p>

<p>Abundance of Projects were laid before them, some too Dangerous,
some too Foolish to be put in practice; at last they resolv'd to
consult <i>with my Philosopher</i>.</p>

<p>He had been but scurvily treated by them in his Troubles, and so
Universally abandon'd by the <i>Crolians</i>, that even the
<i>Solunarians</i> themselves insulted them on that Head, and
laugh'd at them for expecting any Body should venture for them
again.----- But he forgetting their unkindness, ask'd them what it
was they desir'd of him?</p>

<p>They told him, they had heard that he had reported he could put
the <i>Crolians</i> in a way to secure themselves from any
possibility of being insulted again <i>by the Solunarians</i>, and
yet not disturb the publick Tranquility, <i>nor break the Laws</i>;
and they desir'd him, if he knew such a Secret, he would
communicate it to them, and they would be sure to <i>remember to
forget him for it as long as he liv'd</i>.</p>

<p>He frankly told them <i>he had said so, and it was true</i>, he
could put them in a way to do all this if they would follow his
Directions. <i>What's that, says one</i> of the most earnest
Enquirers? ----- 'Tis included in one Word, says he, UNITE.</p>

<p>This most significant Word, deeply and solidly reflected upon,
put them upon strange and various Conjectures, and many long
Debates they had with themselves about it; at last they came again
to him, and ask'd him <i>what he mean't by it</i>?</p>

<p>He told them he knew they were <i>Strangers to the meaning</i>
of the thing, and therefore if they would meet him the next Day he
would come prepar'd to explain himself; accordingly they meet, when
instead of a long Speech they expected from him what sort of Union
he mean't, <i>and with who</i>, he brings them a <i>Thinking
Press</i>, or <i>Cogitator</i>, and setting it down, goes away
without speaking one Word.</p>

<p>This <i>Hyerogliphical</i> Admonition was too plain not <i>to
let them all into his meaning</i>; but still as they are an
obstinate People, and not a little valuing themselves upon their
own Knowledge and Penetration, they slighted the Engine and fell to
off-hand-<i>Surmises</i>, <i>Guesses</i> and <i>Supposes</i>.</p>

<p>1. Some concluded he mean't <i>Unite with the Solunarian
Church</i>, and they reflected upon his Understanding, that not
being the Question in Hand, and something remote from their
Intention, or the High <i>Solunarians</i> Desire.</p>

<p>2. Some mean't <i>Unite</i> to the moderate Party <i>of the
Solunarians</i>, and this they said they had done already.</p>

<p>At last some <i>being very Cunning</i>, found it out, that it
must be his meaning <i>Unite one among another</i>; and even there
again they misunderstood him too; and some imagin'd he mean't down
right Rebellion, Uniting Power, and Mobbing the whole Moon, <i>but
he soon convinc'd them of that too</i>.</p>

<p>At last they took the Hint, that his Advice directed them to
<i>Unite their subdivided Parties</i> into one general Interest,
and to act in Concert upon one bottom, to lay aside the <i>Selfish,
Narrow, Suspicious Spirit</i>; three Qualifications <i>the
Crolians</i> were but too justly charg'd with, and begin to act
with Courage, Unanimity and Largeness of Soul, to open their Eyes
to their own Interest, maintain a regular and constant
Correspondence with one another in all parts of the Kingdom, and
<i>to bring their civil Interest into a Form</i>.</p>

<p>The Author of this Advice having thus brought them to
understand, and approve his Proposal, they demanded his assistance
for making the Essay, and 'tis a most wonderful thing to consider
what a strange effect the alteration of their Measures had upon the
whole <i>Solunarian</i> Nation.</p>

<p>As soon as ever they had settled the Methods they resolv'd to
act in, they form'd <i>a general Council</i> of the Heads of their
Party, to be always sitting, to reconcile Differences, to unite
Parties, to suppress Feuds in their beginning.</p>

<p>They appointed 3 <i>general Meetings</i> in 3 of the most remote
Parts of the Kingdom, to be half yearly, and <i>one universal
Meeting</i> of Persons deputed to concert matters among them in
General.</p>

<p>By that time these Meetings had sat but once, and the Conduct of
the Council of 12 began to appear, 'twas a wonder to see the
prodigious alteration it made all over the Country.</p>

<p>Immediately <i>a Crolian</i> would <i>never buy any thing</i>
but of a <i>Crolian</i>; would hire no Servants, employ neither
Porter nor Carman, but what were <i>Crolians</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Crolians</i> in the Country that wrought and manag'd the
Manufactures, would employ no body but <i>Crolian Spinners, Crolian
Weavers</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>In their capital City the Merchandizing <i>Crolians</i> would
freight no Ships but of which the Owners and Commanders were
<i>Crolians</i>.</p>

<p>They call'd all their Cash out of the <i>Solunarian Bank</i>;
and as the Act of the Cortez confirming the Bank then in being
seem'd to be their Support, they made it plain that Cash and Credit
will make a Bank without a publick Settlement of Law; <i>and
without these</i> all the Laws in the <i>Moon</i> will never be
able to support it.</p>

<p>They brought all their running Cash into one Bank, and settled a
sub-Cash depending upon the Grand-Bank in every Province of the
Kingdom; in which, by a strict Correspondence and crediting their
Bills, they might be able to settle a Paper Credit over the whole
Nation.</p>

<p>They went on to settle themselves in all sorts of Trade in open
Companies, and sold off their Interests in the publick Stocks then
in Trade.</p>

<p>If the Government wanted a Million of Mony upon any Emergency,
they were ready to lend it as a Body, not by different Sums and
private Hands blended together with their Enemies, but as will
appear at large presently, <i>it was only Crolian Mony</i>, and
pass'd as such.</p>

<p>Nor were the Consequences of this <i>New Model</i> less
considerable than the Proposer expected, for the <i>Crolians</i>
being generally of the Trading Manufacturing part of the World, and
<i>very Rich</i>; the influence this method had upon the common
People, upon Trade, and upon the Publick was very considerable
every way.</p>

<p>1. All the <i>Solunarian Trades-Men</i> and <i>Shop-keepers</i>
were at their Wits end, they sat in their Shops and had little or
nothing to do, while the Shops of the <i>Crolians</i> were full of
Customers, and their People over Head and Ears in Business; this
turn'd many of the <i>Solunarian</i> Trades-Men quite off <i>of the
hooks</i>, and they began to break and decay strangely, till at
last a great many of them to prevent their utter Ruin, turn'd
<i>Crolians</i> on purpose to get a Trade; and what forwarded that
part of it was, that when <i>a Solunarian</i>, who had little or no
Trade before, came but over to <i>the Crolians</i>, immediately
every Body come to Trade with him, and his Shop would be full of
Customers, so that this presently encreas'd the number of the
<i>Crolians</i>.</p>

<p>2. The poor People in the Countries, <i>Carders</i>,
<i>Spinners</i>, <i>Weavers</i>, <i>Knitters</i>, and all sorts of
<i>Manufacturers</i>, run in Crowds to the <i>Crolian Temples</i>
for fear of being starv'd, for the <i>Crolians</i> were two thirds
of the Masters or Employers in the Manufactures all over the
Country, and the Poor would ha' been starv'd and undone if they had
cast them out of Work. Thus infenfibly the <i>Crolians</i>
encreas'd their number.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Crolians</i> being Men of <i>vast Cash</i>, they no
sooner withdrew <i>their Mony</i> from the <i>General Bank</i> but
the <i>Bank languisht</i>, Credit <i>sunk</i>, and in a short time
they had little to do, but <i>dissolv'd of Course</i>.</p>

<p>One thing remain'd which People expected would ha' put a Check
to this Undertaking, and that was a way of Trading in Classes,
<i>or Societies</i>, much like our <i>East-India Companies</i> in
<i>England</i>; and these depending upon publick Privileges granted
by the Queen of the Country, or her Predecessors, no Body could
Trade to those Parts but the Persons who had those priviledges: The
cunning <i>Crolians</i>, who had great Stocks in those Trades, and
foresaw they could not Trade by themselves without the publick
<i>Grant or Charter</i>, contriv'd a way to get almost all that
Capital Trade into their Hands as follows.</p>

<p>They concerted Matters, and all at once fell to <i>selling off
their Stock</i>, giving out daily Reports that they would be <i>no
longer concern'd</i>, that it was a losing Trade, that the <i>Fund
at bottom was good for nothing</i>, and that of two Societies
<i>the Old one</i> had not 20 <i>per Cent. to divide</i>, all their
Debts being paid; that the <i>New Society</i> had Traded several
Years, but if they were dissolv'd <i>could not say that they had
got any thing</i>; and that this must be a Cheat at last, and so
they resolv'd to sell.</p>

<p>By this Artifice, they daily offering to Sale, and yet in all
their Discourse <i>discouraging the thing they were to sell</i> no
Body could be found to buy.</p>

<p>The offering a thing to Sale and no Bidders, is a certain
never-failing prospect of <i>a lowring the Price</i>; from this
Method therefore the value of all the Banks, Companies, Societies
and Stocks in the Country fell to be little or nothing worth; and
that was to be bought for 40 or 45 <i>Lunarians</i> that was
formerly sold at 150, and so in proportion of all the rest.</p>

<p>All this while the <i>Crolians</i> employ'd their Emissaries to
buy up privately all the Interest or Shares in these Things that
any of the <i>Solunarian</i> Party would sell.</p>

<p><i>This Plot took readily</i>, for these Gentlemen exposing the
weakness of <i>these Societies</i>, and running down the value of
<i>their Stocks</i>, and at the same time warily buying at the
lowest Prices, not only <i>in time got Possession of the whole
Trade</i>, with their Grants, Privileges and Stocks, but got into
them at a prodigiously low and despicable Price.</p>

<p>They had no sooner thus worm'd them out of the Trade, and got
the greatest part of the Effects in their own Hands, and
consequently the whole Management, but they run up the Price of the
Funds again as high as ever, and laught at the folly of those that
sold out.</p>

<p>Nor could the other People make any Reflections upon the honesty
of the practice, for it was <i>no Original</i>, but had its birth
among the <i>Solunarians themselves</i>, of whom 3 or 4 had
frequently made a Trade of raising and lowring the Funds of the
Societies by all the Clandestine Contrivances in the World, and had
ruin'd abundance of Families to raise their own Fortunes and
Estates.</p>

<p>One of the greatest Merchants <i>in the Moon</i> rais'd himself
by this Method to such a heighth of Wealth, that he left all his
Children married to Grandees, Dukes, and Great Folks; and from a
<i>Mechanick Original</i>, they are now rankt among the
<i>Lunarian</i> Nobility, while multitudes of ruin'd Families helpt
to <i>build his Fortune</i>, by sinking under the Knavery of his
Contrivance.</p>

<p>His Brother in the same Iniquity, being at this time <i>a Man of
the Feather</i>, has carry'd on the same intrieguing Trade with all
the <i>Face</i> and <i>Front</i> imaginable; it has been nothing
with him to persuade his most intimate Friends to <i>Sell</i>, or
<i>Buy</i>, just as he had occasion for his own Interest to have it
<i>rise</i>, or <i>fall</i>, and so to make his own Market of their
Misfortune. Thus he has <i>twice rais'd his Fortunes</i>, for the
<i>House of Feathers</i> demolisht him <i>once</i>, and yet he has
by the same clandestine Management work'd himself up again.</p>

<p>This <i>civil way of Robbing Houses</i>, for I can esteem it no
better, was carry'd on by a middle sort of People, call'd in the
Moon BLOUTEGONDEGOURS, which which signifies <i>Men with two
Tongues</i>, or in English, <i>Stock-Jobbing Brokers</i>.</p>

<p>These had formerly such an unlimited Power and were <i>so
numerous</i>, that indeed they govern'd the whole Trade of the
Country; no Man knew when he <i>Bought</i> or <i>Sold</i>, for tho'
they pretended to Buy and Sell, and Manage <i>for other Men</i>
whose Stocks they had very much at Command, yet nothing was more
frequent than <i>when they bought a thing cheap</i>, to buy it for
<i>themselves</i>; if <i>dear</i>, for their <i>Employer</i>; if
they were to Sell, <i>if the Price rise</i>, it was <i>Sold</i>, if
it <i>Fell</i>, it was <i>Unsold</i>; and by this Art no body got
any Mony but themselves, that at last, excepting the two <i>capital
Men</i> we spoke of before, these govern'd the Prizes of all
things, and nothing could be Bought or Sold to Advantage <i>but
thro' their hands</i>; and as the Profit was prodigious, their
number encreas'd accordingly, so that Business seem'd engross'd by
these Men, and they govern'd the main Articles of Trade.</p>

<p><i>This Success</i>, and the <i>Imprudence of their Conduct</i>,
brought great Complaints against them to the Government, and a Law
was made to <i>restrain them</i>, both in Practice and
<i>Number</i>.</p>

<p>This Law has in some measure had its Effect, the number is not
only lessen'd, but <i>by chance</i> some honester Men <i>than
usual</i> are got in among them, but they are so <i>very, very,
very</i> Few, hardly enough to save a Man's Credit that shall vouch
for them.</p>

<p>Nay, some People that pretend to understand their Business
better than I do, having been of their Number, have affirm'd, it is
impossible to be honest in the employment.</p>

<p>I confess when I began to search into the Conduct of these Men,
at least of some of them, I found there were abundance of black
Stories to be told of them, a great deal known, and a great deal
more unknown; for they were from the beginning continually
Encroaching into all sorts of People and Societies, and in
Conjunction with some that were not qualify'd by Law, but meerly
Voluntarily, call'd in the Moon by a hard long Word, in
<i>English</i> signifying PROJECTORS these erected Stocks <i>in
Shadows</i>, Societies <i>in Nubibus</i>, and Bought and Sold meer
Vapour, Wind, Emptiness and Bluster for Mony, till they drew People
in to lay out their Cash, and then laught at them.</p>

<p>Thus they erected Paper Societies, Linnen Societies, Sulphur
Societies, Copper Societies, Glass Societies, Sham Banks, and a
thousand mock Whimsies to hook unwary People in; at last sold
themselves <i>out</i>, left the Bubble to float a little in the
Air, and then vanish of it self.</p>

<p>The other sort of People <i>go on</i> after all this; and tho'
these Projectors began to be out of Fashion, they always found one
thing or other to amuse and deceive the Ignorant, and went
<i>Jobbing on</i> into all manner of things, Publick as well as
Private, whether the Revenue, the Publick Funds, Loans, Annuities,
<i>Bear-Skins</i>, or any thing.</p>

<p>Nay they were once grown to that extravagant highth, that they
began to Stock-Job the very Feathers of the Consolidator, and in
time the King's employing those People might have had what Feathers
they had occasion for, without concerning the Proprietors of the
Lands much about them.</p>

<p>'Tis true this began to be notorious, and receiv'd some check in
a former meeting of <i>the Feathers</i>; but even now, when I came
away, the three Years expiring, and by Course a new Consolidator
being to be built, they were as busie as ever. Bidding, Offering,
Procuring, Buying, Selling, and Jobbing of Feathers to who bid
most; and notwithstanding several late wholesome and strict Laws
against all manner of Collusion, Bribery and clandestine Methods,
in the Countries procuring these Feathers; never was the Moon in
such an uproar about picking and culling the Feathers, such
Bribery, such Drunkenness, such Caballing, especially among the
High <i>Solunarian</i> Clergy and the <i>Lazognians</i>, such
Feasting, Fighting and Distraction, as the like has never been
known.</p>

<p>And that which is very Remarkable, all this not only before the
Old Consolidator was broke up, but even while it was actually whole
and in use.</p>

<p>Had this hurry been to send up good Feathers, there had been the
less to say, but that which made it very strange to me was, that
where the very worst of all the Feathers were to be found, there
was the most of this wicked Work; and tho' it was bad enough every
where, yet the greatest bustle and contrivance was in order to send
up the worst Feathers they could get.</p>

<p>And indeed some Places such Sorry, Scoundrel, Empty, Husky,
Wither'd, Decay'd Feathers were offer'd to the Proprietors, that I
have sometimes wonder'd any one could have the Impudence to send up
such ridiculous Feathers to make a Consolidator, which, as is
before observ'd, is an Engine of such Beauty, Usefulness and
Necessity.</p>

<p>And still in all my Observation, this Note came in my way, there
was always the most bustle and disturbance about the worst
Feathers.</p>

<p>It was really a melancholly Thing to consider, and had this
Lunar World been my Native Country, I should ha' been full of
concern to see that one thing, on which the welfare of the whole
Nation so much depended, put in so ill a Method, and gotten into
the management of such Men, who for Mony would certainly ha' set up
such Feathers, that wherever the Consolidator should be form'd, it
would certainly <i>over-set</i> the first Voyage; and if the whole
Nation should happen to be Embarkt in it, <i>on the dangerous
Voyage to the Moon</i>, the fall would certainly give them such a
Shock, as would put them all into Confusion, and open the Door to
the <i>Gallunarian</i>, or any Foreign Enemy to destroy them.</p>

<p>It was really strange that this should be the Case, after so
many Laws, and so lately made, against it; but in this, those
People are too like our People in <i>England</i>, who have the best
Laws the worst executed of any Nation under Heaven.</p>

<p>For in the Moon this hurry about choosing of Feathers was grown
to the greatest heighth imaginable, as if it encreast by the very
Laws that were made to suppress it; for now at a certain publick
Place where the <i>Bloutegondegours</i> us'd to meet every Day, any
Body that had but Mony enough might buy a Feather at a reasonable
Rate, and never go down into the Country to fetch it; nay, the
Trade grew so hot, that of a sudden as if no other Business was in
Hand, all people were upon it, and the whole Market was chang'd
from Selling of Bear-Skins, to Buying of Feathers.</p>

<p>Some gave this for a Reason why all the Stocks of the Societies
fell so fast, but there were other Reasons to be given for that,
such as Clubs, Cabals, Stock-Jobbers, Knights, Merchants and
Thie---s. I mean <i>a private Sort</i>, not such as are frequently
Hang'd there, but <i>of a worse Sort</i>, by how much they <i>merit
that Punishment more</i>, but are out of the reach of the Law, can
Rob and pick Pockets in the Face of the Sun, and laugh at the
Families they Ruin, bidding Defiance to all legal Resentment.</p>

<p>To this height things were come under the growing Evil of this
sort of People.</p>

<p>And yet in the <i>very Moon</i> where, as I have noted, the
People are so exceeding <i>clear Sighted</i>, and have such vast
helps to their <i>perceptive Faculties</i>, such Mists are
sometimes cast before the publick Understanding, that they cannot
see the general Interest.</p>

<p>This was manifest, in that just as I came away from that
Country, the great Council of their Wise Men, <i>the Men of the
Feather</i>, were a going to repeal the old Law of Restraining the
Number of these People; and tho' <i>as it was</i>, there was not
Employment for half of them, there being 100 in all, and not above
5 honest ones; yet when I came away they were going to encrease
their Number. I have nothing to say to this here, only that all
Wise Men that <i>understand Trade</i> were very much concern'd at
it, and lookt upon it as a most <i>destructive Thing to the
Publick</i>, and forboding the same mischiefs that Trade suffer'd
before.</p>

<p>It was the particular Misfortune to these Lunar People that this
Country had a better Stock of Governors in all Articles of their
Well-fare, than in their Trade; their Law Affairs had good Judges,
their Church good Patriarchs, <i>except, as might be excepted</i>;
their <i>State</i> good <i>Ministers</i>, their <i>Army</i> good
<i>Generals</i>, and their <i>Consolidator</i> good
<i>Feathers</i>; but in Matters relating to Trade, they had this
particular Misfortune, that those Cases always came before People
<i>that did not understand them</i>.</p>

<p>Even the Judges themselves were often found at a Loss to
determine Causes of Negoce, such as <i>Protests</i>,
<i>Charter-Parties</i>, <i>Avarages</i>, <i>Baratry</i>,
<i>Demorage</i> of Ships, Right of <i>detaining Vessels</i> on
Demorage, and the like; nay, the very Laws themselves are fain to
be silent and yield in many things a Superiority to <i>the Custom
of Merchants</i>.</p>

<p>And here I began to <i>Congratulate my Native Country</i>, where
the Prudence of the Government has provided for these things, by
Establishing in <i>a Commission of Trade</i> some of the <i>most
experienc'd Gentlemen in the Nation</i>, to Regulate, Settle,
Improve, and revive Trade in General, by their unwearyed Labours,
and <i>most consummate Understanding</i>; and this made me pity
these Countries, and think it would be an Action worthy of this
Nation, and be spoken of <i>for Ages to come</i> to their Glory, if
in <i>meer Charity</i> they would appoint or depute <i>these
Gentlemen</i> to go a Voyage to those Countries <i>of the Moon</i>,
and bless those Regions with the Schemes of their sublime
Undertakings, <i>and discoveries in Trade</i>.</p>

<p>But when I was expressing my self thus, my Philosopher
interrupted me, and told me I should see they were already furnisht
for that purpose, when I came to examine the publick Libraries,
<i>of which by it self</i>.</p>

<p>But I was farther confirm'd in my Observation of the weakness of
the <i>publick Heads</i> of that Country, <i>as to Trade</i>, when
I saw another most preposterous Law going forward among them, the
Title of which was specious, and contain'd something relating <i>to
employing the Poor</i>, but the substance of it <i>absolutely
destructive</i> to the very Nature of their Trade, tending to
Transposing, <i>Confounding</i> and Destroying their Manufactures,
and to the Ruin of all their <i>Home-Commerce</i>; never was Nation
so blind to their own Interest as these <i>Lunarian Law Makers</i>,
and the People who were the Contrivers of this Law were so
<i>vainly Conceited</i>, so fond of <i>the guilded Title</i>, and
so <i>positively Dogmatick</i>, that they would not hear the
frequent Applications of Persons better acquainted with those
things than themselves, but pusht it on meerly <i>by the strength
of their Party</i>, for the Vanity of being Authors of such a
Contrivance.</p>

<p>But to return to the new Model of the <i>Crolians</i>. The
advice of the <i>Lunarian</i> Philosopher run now thro' all their
Affairs, UNITE <i>was the Word</i> thro' all the Nation, in Trade,
in Cash, in Stocks, as I noted before.</p>

<p>If a <i>Solunarian</i> Ship was bound to any <i>Out Port</i>, no
<i>Crolian</i> would load any Goods aboard; if any Ship came to
seek Freight abroad, none of the <i>Crolians</i> Correspondents
would Ship any thing unless they knew the Owners <i>were
Crolians</i>; the <i>Crolian Merchants</i> turn'd out all their
<i>Solunarian Masters</i>, <i>Sailors</i> and <i>Captains</i> from
their Ships; and thus, as the <i>Solunarians</i> would have them be
separated in respect of the Government, <i>Profits</i>,
<i>Honours</i> and <i>Offices</i>, they resolv'd to separate in
<i>every thing else</i> too, and to stand by themselves.</p>

<p>At last, upon some publick Occasion, the publick
<i>Treasurers</i> of the Land sent to the capital City, to borrow
500000 <i>Lunarians</i> upon very good Security of establisht
Funds; <i>truly no Body would lend any Mony</i>, or at least they
could not raise above a 5th part of that Sum, enquiring <i>at the
Bank</i>, at their general <i>Societies Cash</i>, and other Places,
all was <i>languid</i> and <i>dull</i>, and <i>no Mony to be
had</i>; but being inform'd that the <i>Crolians</i> had erected a
Bank of their own, they <i>sent thither</i>, and were answered
<i>readily</i>, that whatever Sum the Government wanted, was at
their Service, only it was to be lent not by particular Persons,
but <i>such a Grandee</i> being one of the prime Nobility, and who
<i>the Crolians</i> now call'd their Protector, was to be
<i>Treated with about it</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Government saw no harm in all this</i>; here was no Law
broken, here was nothing but Oppression answered with Policy, and
Mischief fenc'd against with Reason.</p>

<p>The Government therefore took no Notice of it, <i>nor made any
Scruple when they wanted any Mony</i> to Treat with this Nobleman,
and borrow any Sum <i>of the Crolians</i>, as <i>Crolians</i>; on
the contrary in the Name of the <i>Crolians</i>; their <i>Head or
Protector</i> presented their <i>Addresses</i> and
<i>Petitions</i>, procur'd Favours on one Hand, and Assistance on
the other; and thus <i>by degrees</i> and <i>insensibly</i> the
<i>Crolians</i> became <i>a Politick Body</i>, settled and
establish'd by Orders and Rules among themselves; and while <i>a
Spirit of Unanimity</i> thus run thro' all their Proceedings,
<i>their Enemies could never hurt them</i>, their Princes always
saw it was <i>their Interest</i> to keep Measures with them, and
they were sure to have Justice upon any Complaint whatsoever.</p>

<p><i>When I saw this</i>, it forc'd me to reflect upon Affairs in
our own Country; <i>Well, said I</i>, 'tis happy for <i>England</i>
that our <i>Dissenters</i> have not this Spirit of <i>Union</i> and
Largeness of Heart among them; for if they were not a
<i>Narrow</i>, mean-<i>Spirited</i>, short-<i>Sighted,
self-Preserving, friend-Betraying, poor-Neglecting People</i>, they
might ha' been every way as Safe, as Considerable, as Regarded and
as Numerous as the <i>Crolians</i> in the <i>Moon</i>; but it is
not in their Souls to do themselves Good, nor to Espouse, or Stand
by those that would do it for them; and 'tis well for the
Church-Men that it is so, for many Attempts have been made to save
them, but their own narrowness of Soul, and dividedness in Interest
has always prevented its being effectual, and discourag'd all the
Instruments that ever attempted to serve them.</p>

<p>'Tis confest the Case was thus at first among the
<i>Crolians</i>, they were full of Divisions among themselves, as I
have noted already of the <i>Solunarians</i>, and the unhappy Feuds
among them, had always not only expos'd them to the Censure,
Reproach and Banter of their <i>Solunarian</i> Enemies, but it had
serv'd to keep them under, prevent their being valued in the
Government, and given the other Party vast Advantages against.</p>

<p>But the <i>Solunarians</i> driving thus furiously <i>at their
Destruction</i> and entire Ruin, open'd their Eyes to the following
Measures for their preservation: And here again <i>the high
Solunarians</i> may see, and doubtless whenever they made use of
the Lunar-Glasses they must see it, that nothing could ha' driven
the <i>Crolians</i> to make use of such Methods for their Defence,
but the rash Proceedings of their own warm Men, in order to
suppressing the whole <i>Crolian</i> Interest. And this might
inform our Country-men of the Church of <i>England</i>, that it
cannot but be their Interest to Treat their Brethren with
Moderation and Temper, least their Extravagances should one time or
other drive the other as it were by Force into their Senses, and
open their Eyes to do only all those Things which by Law they may
do, and which they are laught at by all the World for not
doing.</p>

<p>This was the very Case in the Moon: The Philosopher, <i>or
pretended-such as before</i>, had often publish'd, that <i>it was
their Interest to</i> UNITE; but their Eyes not being open to the
true Causes and Necessity of it, their Ears were shut against the
Council, <i>till Oppression and Necessities drove them to
it</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly they entred into a serious Debate, of the State of
their own Affairs, and finding the Advice given, very reasonable;
they set about it, and the Author gave them a Model, Entitl'd <i>An
enquiry into what the Crolians may lawfully do, to prevent the
certain Ruin of their Interest, and bring their Enemies to
Peace</i>.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to examine the Contents of this sublime
Tract; but from this very Day, we found the <i>Crolians</i> in the
Moon, acting quite on a different Foot from all their former
Conduct, putting on a new Temper, and a new Face, as you have
hear'd.</p>

<p>All this while the hot <i>Solunarians</i> cried out <i>Plots,
Associations, Confederacies</i>, and <i>Rebellions</i>, when indeed
here was nothing done but what the <i>Laws justify'd</i>, what
<i>Reason directed</i>, and what <i>had the Crolians but made use
of the Cogitator</i>, they would ha' done 40 Year before.</p>

<p>The Truth is, the other People had no Remedy, but <i>to cry
Murther</i>, and make a Noise; for the <i>Crolians</i> went on with
their Affairs, and Establisht themselves so, that when I came away,
they were become a most Solid, and well United Body, made a
considerable Figure in the Nation, and yet the Government was easy;
for the <i>Solunarians</i> found when they had attain'd the utmost
end of their Wishes, her <i>Solunarian Majesty</i> was as safe as
before, and the <i>Crolians</i> Property being secur'd, they were
as Loyal Subjects as the <i>Solunarians</i>, as consistent with
Monarchy, as useful to it, and <i>as pleas'd with it</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot but Remark here, that this <i>Union of the Crolians</i>
among themselves had another Consequence, which made it appear it
was not only to their own Advantage, but to the general Good of all
the Natien.</p>

<p>For, <i>by little, and little</i>, the Feuds of the Parties
cool'd, and the <i>Solunarians</i> began to be better reconcil'd to
them; the Government was <i>easy and safe</i>, and the private
Quarrels, as I have been told since, begin to be quite forgot.</p>

<p>What Blindness, <i>said I to my self</i>, has possest the
Dissenters in our unhappy Country of <i>England</i>, where by
eternal <i>Discords</i>, <i>Feuds</i>, <i>Distrusts</i> and
<i>Disgusts</i> among themselves, they always fill their Enemies
with Hopes, that by pushing at them, they may one time or other
compleat their Ruin; which Expectation has always serv'd as a means
to keep open the Quarrel; whereas had the Dissenters been United in
<i>Interest</i>, <i>Affection</i> and <i>Mannagement</i> among
themselves, all this Heat had long ago <i>been over</i>, and the
Nation, tho' there had been <i>two Opinions</i> had retain'd but
<i>one Interest</i>, been joyn'd in Affection, and <i>Peace at Home
been rais'd</i> up to that Degree that all Wise Men wish, as it is
now among the Inhabitants of the World in the Moon.</p>

<p>Tis true, in all the Observations I made in this Lunar Country,
the vast deference paid to the Persons of Princes began to lessen,
and whatever Respect they had for the <i>Office</i>, they found it
necessary frequently to tell the World that <i>on occasion</i>,
they could Treat them with less Respect than <i>they pretended to
owe them</i>.</p>

<p>For about this time, the <i>Divine Right</i> of Kings, and the
Inheritances of Princes <i>in the Moon</i>, met with a terrible
Shock, and that by the <i>Solunarian Party themselves</i>; and
insomuch that even my Philosopher, and he was none of the <i>Jure
Divino Men</i>, neither declar'd, against it.</p>

<p>They made <i>Crowns perfect Foot-balls</i>, set up what Kings
they would, and <i>pull'd down</i> such as they did not like,
<i>Ratitione Voluntas</i>, right or wrong, as they thought best, of
which some Examples shall be given by and by.</p>

<p>After I had thus enquir'd into the Historical Affairs of this
Lunar Nation, which for its Similitude to my Native Country, I
could not but be inquisitive in; I wav'd a great many material
Things, which at least I cannot enter upon the Relation of here,
and began to enquire into their Affairs abroad.</p>

<p>I think I took notice in the beginning of my Account of these
parts, that I found them engag'd in a tedious and bloody War, with
one of the most mighty Monarchs of all the Moon.</p>

<p>I must therefore hint, that among the multitude of things, which
for brevity sake I omit, the Reader may observe these were
some.</p>

<p>1. That this was the same Monarch who harbour'd and entertain'd
the <i>Abrogratzian</i> Prince, who was fled as before, and who we
are to call the King of <i>Gallunaria</i>.</p>

<p>2. I have omitted the Account of a long and bloody War, which
lasted a great many Years, and which the present Queens
Predecessor, mannag'd with a great deal of Bravery and Conduct, and
finisht very much to his own Glory, and the Nations Advantage.</p>

<p>3. I have too much omitted to Note, how <i>Barbarously</i> the
<i>High Solunarian Church Men</i> treated him for all his Services,
upbraided him with the Expence of the War; and tho' he sav'd them
all from Ruin and <i>Abrogratzianism</i>, yet had not one good Word
for him, and indeed 'tis with some difficulty that I pass this
over, because it might be necessary to observe, besides what is
said before, that Ingratitude is a Vice in Nature, and practis'd
every where, as well as in <i>England</i>. So that we need not
upbraid the <i>Party</i> among us with their ill Treatment of the
late King, for these People us'd their good King every Jot as bad,
till their unkindness perfectly broke his Heart.</p>

<p>Here also I am oblig'd to omit the Historical Part of the War,
and of the Peace that follow'd; only I must observe that this Peace
was very <i>Precarious</i>, Short and <i>Unhappy</i>, and in a few
Months the War broke out again, with as much Fury as ever.</p>

<p>In this War happen'd one of the strangest, unaccountable and
most preposterous Actions, that ever a People in their National
Capacity could be guilty of.</p>

<p>Certainly if our People in <i>England</i>, who pretend that
Kingship is <i>Jure Divino</i>, did but know the Story of which I
speak, they would be quite of another Mind; wherefore I crave leave
to relate part of the History, or Original of this last War, as a
necessary Introduction to the proper Observations I shall make upon
it.</p>

<p>There was a King of a certain Country in the Moon, call'd in
their Language, <i>Ebronia</i>, who was formerly a Confederate with
the <i>Solunarians</i>. This Prince dying without Issue, the great
Monarch we speak of, seiz'd upon all his Dominions as his
Right.----- Tho' if I remember right, he had formerly Sworn never
to lay Claim to it, and after that by a subsequent Treaty had
agreed with the <i>Solunarian</i> Prince, that another Monarch who
claim'd a Right as well as he, should divide it between them.</p>

<p>The breach of this Agreement, and seizing this Kingdom, put
almost all the Lunar World into a Flame, and War hung over the
Heads of all the Northern Nations of the Moon, for several Claims
were made to the Succession by other Princes, and particularly by a
certain Potent Prince call'd the <i>Eagle</i>, of an Ancient
Family, whose <i>Lunar</i> Name I cannot well express, but in
<i>English</i> it signifies <i>the Men of the great Lip</i>;
whether it was Originally a sort of a Nick Name, or whether they
had any such thing as a great Lip Hereditary to the Family, by
which they were distinguisht, is not worth my while to Examine.</p>

<p>'Tis without question that the successive Right, <i>if their
Lunar Successions, are Govern'd as ours are in this world</i>,
devolv'd upon this Man <i>with the Lip</i> and his Families; but
the <i>Gallunarian</i> Monarch brought things so to pass, by his
extraordinary Conduct, that the <i>Ebronian</i> King was drawn in
by some of his Nobility, <i>who this Prince had Bought</i> and
Brib'd to betray their Country to his Interest, and particularly a
certain <i>High Priest</i> of that Country, to make an Assignment,
or <i>deed of Gift</i> of all his Dominions to the Grandson of this
<i>Gallunarian</i> Monarch.</p>

<p><i>By Vertue of this Gift</i>, or Legacy, as soon as the King
dyed, who was then languishing, and as the other Parry alledg'd,
not in <i>a very good capacity to make a Will</i>; the
<i>Gallunarian</i> King sent his Grandson to seize upon the Crown,
and backing him with suitable Forces, took Possession of all his
strong Fortifications and Frontiers.</p>

<p>Nor was this all, <i>the Man with the Lip</i> indeed talkt big,
and threatned War immediately, but the <i>Solunarians</i> were so
unsettl'd at Home, so unprepar'd for War, having but just dismist
their Auxiliar Troops, and disbanded their own, and the Prince was
so ill serv'd by his Subjects, that both he and a Powerful
Neighbour, Nations in the same Interest, were meerly Bullyed by
this <i>Gallunarian</i>; and as he threatned immediately to Invade
them, which they were then in no Condition to prevent, he forc'd
them both to submit to his Demand, <i>tacitely allow</i> what he
had done in breaking the Treaty with him, and at last openly
<i>acknowledge</i> his new King.</p>

<p><i>This was indeed a most unaccountable Step</i>, but there was
a necessity to plead, for he was at their very Doors with his
Forces; and this Neighbouring People, who they call
<i>Mogenites</i>, could not resist him without help from the
<i>Solunarians</i>, which they were very backward in,
notwithstanding the <i>earnest Sollicitations of their Prince</i>,
and notwithstanding they were oblig'd to do it <i>by a solemn
Treaty</i>.</p>

<p>These delays oblig'd them to this strange Step of
<i>acknowledging</i> the Invasion of their Enemy, and <i>pulling
off the Hat</i> to the New King he had set up.</p>

<p><i>'Tis true</i>, the Policy of these Lunar Nations was very
Remarkable in this Case, and they out-witted the <i>Gallunarian</i>
Monarch in it; for by the owning this Prince, whom they immediately
after <i>Declar'd a Usurper</i>, and made War against; they stopt
the Mouth of the <i>Gallunarian</i> his Grandfather, took from him
all pretence of Invading them, and <i>making him believe they were
Sincere</i>, Wheedl'd him to restore several Thousands of their Men
who he had taken Prisoners in the Frontier Towns of the
<i>Ebronians</i>.</p>

<p>Had the <i>Gallunarian</i> Prince had but the forecast to ha'
seen, that this was but a forc'd pretence to gain Time, and that as
soon as they had <i>their Troops clear</i> and Time to raise more,
they would certainly turn upon him again, he would never ha' been
put by with so weak a Trifle as the <i>Ceremony of
Congratulation</i>; whereas had he immediately pusht at them with
all his Forces, they must ha' been Ruin'd, and he had carry'd his
Point without much Interruption.</p>

<p>But here he lost his Opportunity, which he never retriev'd;
<i>for 'tis in the Moon, just as 'tis here</i>, when an Occasion is
lost, it is not easy to be recover'd, for both the
<i>Solunarians</i> and the <i>Mogenites</i> quickly threw off the
Mask, and declaring this new Prince an <i>Usurper</i>, and his
Grandfather an <i>Unjust breaker of Treaties</i>, they prepar'd for
War against them both.</p>

<p>As to the Honesty of this matter, my Philosopher and I differ'd
extremely, he exclaim'd against the Honour of acknowledging a King,
with a design to Depose him, and pretending Peace when War is
design'd; tho' 'tis true, they are too customary in our World; but
however, as to him I insisted upon the lawfulness of it, from the
universal Custom of Nations, who generally do things ten times more
Preposterous and Inconsistent, when they suit their Occasions. Yet
I hope no Body will think I am recommending them by this Relation
to the Practice of our own Nations, but rather exposing them as
unaccountable things never to be put in Practice, without quitting
all pretences to Justice and national Honesty.</p>

<p>The Case was this.</p>

<p>As upon the Progress of Matters before related, the
<i>Solunarians</i> and <i>Mogenites</i> had made a formal
acknowledgment of this new Monarch, the Grandson of the
<i>Gallunarian</i> King, so as I have hinted already, they had no
other design than to Depose him, and pull him down.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as <i>by the aforesaid Wile</i> they had
gain'd Breath, and furnisht themselves with Forces, they
<i>declar'd War</i> against both the <i>Gallunarian</i> King, and
his Grandson, and entred into strict Confederacy with <i>the Man of
the great Lip</i>, who was the Monarch of the <i>Eagle</i>, and who
by right of Succession, had the true Claim to the <i>Ebronian</i>
Crowns.</p>

<p>In these Declarations they alledge that Crowns do not <i>descend
by Gift</i>, nor are Kingdoms given away <i>by Legacy</i>, like a
Gold <i>Ring at a Funeral</i>, and therefore this young Prince
could have no Right, the former deceas'd King having <i>no Right to
dispose it by Gift</i>.</p>

<p>I must allow, that judging by our Reason, and the Practice in
our Countries here, <i>on this side the Moon</i>; this seem'd
plain, and I saw no difference in matters of Truth there, or here,
but Right and Liberty both of Princes and People seems to be the
same in that World, as it is in this, and upon this account I
thought the Reasons of this War very Just, and that the Claim of
Right to the Succession of the <i>Ebronian</i> Crown, was
undoubtedly <i>in the Man with the Lip</i>, and his Heirs, and so
far the War was most Just, and the Design reasonable.</p>

<p>And thus far my Lunar Companion agreed with me, and had they
gone on so, says he, they had my good Wishes, and my Judgment had
been Witness to my Pretences, that they were in the right.</p>

<p>But in the prosecution of this War, says he, they went on to one
of the most Impolitick, Ridiculous, Dishonest, and Inconsistent
Actions, that ever any Nation in the Moon was guilty of; the Fact
was thus.</p>

<p>Having agreed among themselves that the <i>Ebronian</i> Crown
should not be possest by the <i>Gallunarian</i> King's Grandson,
they in the next Place began to consider who should have it.</p>

<p><i>The Man with the Lip had the Title</i>, but he had a great
Government of his own, Powerful, Happy and Remote, being as is
noted, the Lord of the great <i>Eagle</i>, and he told them he
could not pretend <i>to come to Ebronia to be a King there</i>; his
eldest Son truly was not only declar'd Heir apparent to his Father,
but had another <i>Lunarian Kingdom</i> of his own still more
remote than that, and he would not quit all this for the Crown of
<i>Ebronia</i>, so it was concerted by all the Confederated
Parties, that the <i>second Son</i> of this Prince, <i>the Man with
the Lip</i>, should be declar'd King, and here lay the Injustice of
all the Case.</p>

<p>I confess at my first examining this Matter, I did not see far
into it, nor could I reach the Dishonesty of it, and perhaps the
Reader of these Sheets may be in the same Case; but my old
<i>Lunarian Friend</i> being continually exclaiming against the
Matter, and blaming his Country-men the <i>Solunarians</i> for the
Dishonesty of it, but especially the <i>Mogenites</i>, he began to
be something peevish with me that I should be so dull as not to
reach it, and askt me if he should screw me into the
<i>Thinking-Press</i> for the Clearing up my Understanding.</p>

<p>At last he told me he would write his particular Sentiments of
this whole Affair in a Letter to me, which he would so order as it
should <i>effectually open mine Eyes</i>; which indeed it did, and
so I believe it will the Eyes of all that read it; to which purpose
I have obtain'd of the Author <i>to assist me in the
Translation</i> of it, he having some Knowledge also in our
<i>Sublunar Languages</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Sustance of a Letter, wrote to the Author of these
Sheets, while he was in the Regions of the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>'<i>Friend from the Moon</i>,</p>

<p>'According to my promise, I hereby give you a Scheme of
<i>Solunarian</i> Honesty, join'd with <i>Mogenite</i> Policy, and
my Opinion of the Action of my Country-men and their Confederates,
in declaring their new made <i>Ebronian</i> King.</p>

<p>'The <i>Mogenites</i> and <i>Solunarians</i> are look'd upon
here to be the Original Contrivers of this ridiculous piece of
Pageantry, and tho' some of their Neighbours are suppos'd to have a
Hand in it, yet we all lay it at the door of their Politicks, and
for the Honesty of it let them answer it if they can.</p>

<p>''Tis observ'd here, that as soon as the King of
<i>Gallunaria</i> had declar'd that he accepted the Will and
Disposition of the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>, in favour of his
Grandson, and that according to the said Disposition, he had own'd
him for King; and in order to make it effectual, had put him into
immediate Possession of the Kingdom. The <i>Mogenites</i> and their
Confederates made wonderful Clamours at the Injustice of his
Proceedings, and particularly on account of his breaking the Treaty
then lately entred into with the King of the <i>Solunarians</i> and
the <i>Mogenites</i>, for the settling the Matter of Right and
Possession, in case of the Demise of the <i>Ebronian</i> King.</p>

<p>'However, the King of <i>Gallunaria</i> had no sooner plac'd his
Grandson on the Throne, but the <i>Mogenites</i> and other Nations,
and <i>to all our Wonder</i>, the King of <i>Solunaria</i> himself
acknowledg'd him, own'd him, sent their Ministers, and Compliments
of Congratulation, and the like, giving him the Title of King of
<i>Ebronia</i>.</p>

<p>'Tho' this proceeding had something of Surprize in it, and all
Men expected to see something more than ordinary Politick in the
effect of it, yet it did not give half the astonishment to the
Lunar World, as this unaccountable Monster of Politicks begins to
do.</p>

<p>'We have here two unlucky Fellows, call'd <i>Pasquin</i> and
<i>Marforio</i>, these had a long Dialogue about this very Matter,
and <i>Pasquin</i> as he always lov'd Mischief, told a very unlucky
Story to his Comrade, of a high <i>Mogenite</i> Skipper, as
follows.</p>

<p>'A <i>Mogenite</i> Ship coming from a far Country, the Custom
House Officers found some Goods on Board, which were Controband,
and for which they pretended the Ship and Goods were all
Confiscated; the Skipper, or <i>Captain</i> in a great Fright,
comes up to the Custom-House, and being told he must Swear to
something relating to his taking in those Goods, reply'd in his
Country <i>Jargon, Ya, dat sall Ick doen Myn Heer</i>; or in
<i>English, Ay, Ay, I'll Swear</i>.----- But finding they did not
assure him that it would clear his Ship he scruples the Oath again,
at which they told him it would clear his Ship immediately.
<i>Hael, well Myn Heer</i>, says the <i>Mogen</i> Man, <i>vat mot
Ick sagen, Ick sall all Swear myn Skip to salvare</i>, i.e. I shall
Swear any thing to save my Skip.</p>

<p>'We apply this Story thus.</p>

<p>'If the <i>Mogenites</i> did acknowledge the King of
<i>Ebronia</i>, we did believe it was done <i>to save the Skip</i>;
and when they reproacht the <i>Gallunarian</i> King, with breaking
the Treaty of Division, we us'd to say we would all break thro'
twice as many Engagements for half as much Advantage.</p>

<p>'This setting up a new King, against a King on the Throne,
Acknowledg'd and Congratulated by them, is not only look'd on in
the Lunar World, as a thing Ridiculous, but particularly Infamous,
that they should first acknowledge a King, and then set up the
Title of another. If the Title of the first <i>Ebronian</i> King be
good, this must be an Impostor, an Usurper of another Man's Right;
if it was not good, why did they acknowledge him, and give him the
full Title of all the <i>Ebronian</i> Dominions? Caress and
Congratulate him, and make a publick Action of it to his
Ambassador.</p>

<p>'Will they tell us they were Bully'd, and Frighted into it? that
is to own they may be hufft into an ill Action; for owing a Man in
the Posession of what is none of his own, is an ill thing, and he
that may be hufft into one ill Action, may by Consequence be hufft
into another, and so into any thing.</p>

<p>'What will they say for doing it? we have heard there has been
in the World you came from, a way found out to own Kings <i>de
Facto</i>, but not <i>de Jure</i>; if they will fly to that
ridiculous Shift, let them tell the World so, that we may know what
they mean, for those foolish things are not known here.</p>

<p>'If they own'd the King of <i>Ebronia</i> voluntarily, and
acknowledg'd his Right as we thought they had; how then can this
young Gentleman have a Title, unless they have found out a new
Division, and so will have two Kings of <i>Ebronia</i>, make them
Partners, and have a <i>Gallunarian</i> King of <i>Ebronia</i>, and
a <i>Mogenite</i> King of <i>Ebronia</i>, both together?</p>

<p>'Our Lunar Nations, Princes and States, whatever they may do in
your World, always seek for some Pretences at least to make their
Actions seem Honest, whither they are so or no; and therefore they
generally publish Memorials, Manifesto's and Declarations, of their
Reasons why, and on what account they do so, or so; that those who
have any Grounds to charge them with Unjustice, may be answer'd,
and silenc'd; 'tis for the People in your Country, to fall upon
their Neighbours, only because they will do it, and make
probability of Conquest, a sufficient Reason of Conquest; the
<i>Lunarian</i> Nations are seldom so destitute of Modesty, but
that they will make a shew of Justice, and make out the Reasons of
their Proceedings; and tho' sometimes we find even the Reasons
given for some Actions are weak enough; yet it is a bad Cause
indeed, that can neither have a true Reason, nor a pretended one.
The custom of the Moon has oblig'd us to show so much respect to
Honesty, that when our Actions have the least colour of Honesty,
yet we will make Reasons to look like a Defence, whether it be so
or no.</p>

<p>'But here is an Action that has neither reality, nor pretence,
here is not Face enough upon it to bear an Apology. First, they
acknowledge one King, and then set up another King against him;
either they first acknowledg'd a wrong King, and thereby became
Parties to a Usurper, or they act now against all the Rules of
common Justice in the World, to set up a sham King, to pull down a
true one, only because 'tis their Interest to have it so.</p>

<p>'This makes the very Name of a <i>Solunarian</i> scandalous to
all the Moon, and Mankind look upon them with the utmost Prejudice,
as if they were a Nation who had sold all their Honesty to their
Interest; and who could act this way to Day, and that way to
Morrow, without any regard to Truth, or the Rule of Honour, Equity
or Conscience; <i>This is Swearing any thing to save the Skip</i>;
and never let any Man Reproach the <i>Gallunarian</i> King with
breaking the Treaty of Division, and disregarding the Faith and
Stipulations of Leagues; for this is an Action so inconsistent with
it self, so incongruous to common Justice, to the Reason and Nature
of things, that no History of any of these latter Times can
parallel it, and 'tis past the Power of Art to make any reasonable
Defence for it.</p>

<p>'Indeed some lame Reasons are given for it by our Polititians.
First, they say the Prince with the great Lip was extremely prest
by the <i>Gallunarians</i> at Home in his own Country, and not
without apprehensions of seeing them e'er long, under the Walls of
his capital City.</p>

<p>'From this circumstance of the Man with the Lip, 'twas not
irrational to expect that he might be induc'd to make a separate
Peace with the <i>Gallunarians</i>, and serve them as he did once
the Prince of <i>Berlindia</i> at the Treaty of Peace in a former
War, where he deserted him after the solemnest Engagements never to
make Peace without him; but his pressing Occasions requiring it,
concluded a Peace without him, and left him to come out of the War,
as well as he could, tho' he had come into it only for his
Assistance. Now finding him in danger of being ruin'd by the
<i>Gallunarian</i> Power, and judging from former Practice in like
Cases, that he might be hurry'd into a Peace, and leave them in the
Lurch; they have drawn him into this Labrinth, as into a Step,
which can never be receded from without the utmost Affront and
Disgrace, either to the Family of the <i>Gallunarian</i>, or of the
Lip; an Action which in its own Nature, is a Defiance of the whole
<i>Gallunarian</i> Power, and without any other Manifesto, may be
taken as a Declaration from the House of the <i>Lip</i>, to the
<i>Gallunarian</i>, that this War shall never end, till one of
those two Families are ruin'd and reduc'd.</p>

<p>'What Condition the Prince with the Lip's Power is in, to make
such a huff at this Time, shall come under Examination by and by;
in the mean time the <i>Solunarians</i> have clench'd the Nail, and
secur'd the War to last as long as they think convenient.</p>

<p>'If the <i>Gallunarians</i> should get the better, and reduce
the <i>Man with the Lip</i> to Terms never so disadvantageous, he
cannot now make a Peace without leave from the <i>Solunarians</i>
and the <i>Mogenites</i>, least his Son should be ruin'd also.-----
Or if he should make Articles for himself, it must be with ten
times the Dishonour that he might have done before.</p>

<p>'Politicians say, 'tis never good for a Prince to put himself
into a case of Desperation. This is drawing the Sword, and throwing
away the Scabbard; if a Disaster should befal him, his Retreat is
impossible, and this must have been done only to secure the <i>Man
with the Lip</i> from being hufft, or frighted into a separate
Peace.</p>

<p>'The second Reason People here give, why the <i>Solunarians</i>
are concerning themselves in this Matter, is drawn from Trade.</p>

<p>'The continuing of <i>Ebronia</i> in the Hands of the
<i>Gallunarians</i>, will most certainly be the Destruction of the
<i>Solunarian</i> and <i>Mogenites</i> Trade, both to that Kingdom,
and the whole Seas on that side of the Moon; as this Article
includes a fifth Part of all the Trade of the Moon, and would in
Conjunction with the <i>Gallunarians</i> at last bring the
Mastership of the Sea, out of the Hands of the other, so it would
in effect be more detriment to those two Nations, than ten Kingdoms
lost, if they had them to part with.</p>

<p>'This the <i>Solunarians</i> foreseeing, and being extremely
sensible of the entire Ruin of their Trade, have left no Stone
unturn'd to bring this piece of Pageantry on the Stage, by which
they have hook'd in the Old Black <i>Eagle</i> to plunge himself
over Head and Ears in the Quarrel, in such a manner, as he can
never go back with any tolerable Honour; he can never quit his Son
and the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>, without the greatest Reproach and
Disgrace of all the World in the Moon.</p>

<p>'Now whether one, or both of these Reasons are true in this
Case, as most believe both of them to be true; the Policy of my
Country-men, the <i>Solunarians</i> is visible indeed, but as for
their Honesty, it is past finding out.</p>

<p>'But it is objected here, this Son <i>of the Lip</i> has an
undoubted Right to the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>. We do not Fight now
to set up an Usurper, but to pull down an Usurper, and it has been
made plain by the Manifesto, that the giving a Kingdom by Will, is
no conveyance of Right; the Prince of the <i>Eagle</i> has an
undoubted Right, and they Fight to maintain it.</p>

<p>'If this be true, then we must ask these High and Mighty
Gentlemen how came they to recognize and acknowledge the present
King on the Throne? why did they own an Usurper if he be such?
either one or other must be an act of Cowardize and Injustice, and
all the Politicks of the Moon cannot clear them of one of these two
Charges; either they were Cowardly Knaves before, or else they must
be Cunning Knaves now.</p>

<p>'If the Young <i>Eagle</i> has an undoubted Title now, so he had
before, and they knew it as well before, as they do now; what can
they say for themselves, why they should own a King, who they knew
had no Title, or what can they say for going to pull down one that
has a Title?</p>

<p>'I must be allow'd to distinguish between Fighting with a
Nation, and Fighting with the King. For Example. Our Quarrel with
the <i>Gallunarians</i> is with the whole Nation, as they are grown
too strong for their Neighbours. But our Quarrel with
<i>Ebronia</i> is not with the Nation, but with their King, and
this Quarrel seems to be unjust in this particular, at least in
them who own'd him to be King, for that put an end to the
Controversy.</p>

<p>''Tis true, the Justice of publick Actions, either in Princes,
or in States, is no such nice Thing, that any Body should be
surpriz'd, to see the Government forfeit their Faith, and it seems
the <i>Solunarians</i> are no more careful this way, than their
Neighbours. But then those People should in especial manner forbear
to reproach Other Nations and Princes, with the breaches which they
themselves are subject too.</p>

<p>'As to the <i>Eagle</i>, we have nothing to say to the Honesty
of his declaring his Son King of <i>Ebronia</i>, for as is hinted
before, he never acknowledg'd the Title of the Usurper, but always
declar'd, and insisted on his own undoubted Right, and that he
would recover it if he could.</p>

<p>'Without doubt the <i>Eagle</i> has a Title by Proximity of
Blood, founded on the renunciation of the King of <i>Gallunaria</i>
formerly mention'd, and if the Will of the late King be Invalid, or
he had no Right to give the Soveraignty of his Kingdoms away, then
the <i>Eagle</i> is next Heir.</p>

<p>'But as we quit his Morals, and justify the Honesty of his
Proceedings in the War, against the present King of <i>Ebronia</i>,
so in this Action of declaring his second Son. We must begin to
question his Understanding, and saying a respect of decency, it
looks as if his Musical Head was out of Tune, to <i>Illus
tratellus</i>. I crave leave to tell you a Story out of your own
Country, which we have heard of hither. A <i>French</i> Man that
could speak but broken <i>English</i>, was at the Court of
<i>England</i>, when on some occasion he happen'd to hear the Title
of the King of <i>England</i> read thus, <i>Charles the</i> II.
<i>King of England, Scotland France and Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>'Vat is dat you say? says Monsieur, being a little affronted,
the Man reads it again, as before. <i>Charles the Second, King of
England, Scotland, France and Ireland</i>.------ <i>Charles the
Second, King of France! Ma Foy</i>, says the <i>French</i> Man,
<i>you can no read, Charles the Second, King of France, ha! ha! ha!
Charles the Second, King of France, when he can catch</i>. Any one
may apply the Story, whether it was a true one or no.</p>

<p>'All the Lunar World looks on it, therefore, as a most
Ridiculous, Senseless Thing, to make a Man a King of a Country he
has not one Foot of Land in, nor can have a Foot there, but what he
must Fight for. As to the probability of gaining it, I have nothing
to say to it, but if we may guess at his Success there, by what has
been done in other Parts of the Moon, we find he has Fought three
Campaigns, to lose every Foot he had got.</p>

<p>'It had been much more to the Honour of the <i>Eagle</i>'s
Conduct, and of the young Hero himself, first to ha' let him ha'
fac'd his Enemy in the Field, and as soon as he had beaten him, the
<i>Ebronians</i> would have acknowledg'd him fast enough; or his
own Victorious Troops might have Proclaim'd him at the Gate of
their Capital City; and if after all, the Success of the War had
deny'd him the Crown he had fought for, he had the Honour to have
shown his Bravery, and he had been where he was, a Prince of the
Great Lip. A Son of the <i>Eagle</i> is a Title much more
Honourable than a King Without a Crown, without Subjects, without a
Kingdom, and another Man upon his Throne; but by this declaring him
King, the <i>old Eagle</i> has put him under a necessity of gaining
the Kingdom of <i>Ebronia</i>, which at best is a great hazard, or
if he fails to be miserably despicable, and to bear all his Life
the constant Chagrin of a great Title and no Possession.</p>

<p>'How ridiculous will this poor Young Gentleman look, if at last
he should be forc'd to come Home again without his Kingdom? what a
King of Clouts will he pass for, and what will this <i>King-making
old Gentlemen, his Father say</i>, when the young Hero shall tell
him, your Majesty has made me Mock King for all the World to laugh
at.</p>

<p>''Twas certainly the weakest Thing that could be, for the
<i>Eagle</i> thus to make him a King of that, which, were the
probability greater than it is, he may easily, without the help of
a Miracle, be disappointed of.</p>

<p>''Tis true, the Confederates talk big, and have lately had a
great Victory, and if Talk will beat the King of <i>Ebronia</i> out
of his Kingdom, he is certainly undone, but we do not find the
<i>Gallunarians</i> part with any thing they can keep, nor that
they quit any thing without Blows; It must cost a great deal of
Blood and Treasure before this War can be ended; if absolute
Conquest on one side must be the Matter, and if the Design on
<i>Ebronia</i> should miscarry, as one Voyage thither has done
already, where are we then? Let any Man but look back, and consider
what a sorry Figure your Confederate Fleet in your World had made,
after their <i>Andalusian Expedition</i>, if they had not more by
Fate than Conduct, chopt upon a Booty at <i>Vigo</i> as they came
back.</p>

<p>'In the like condition, will this new King come back, if he
should go for a Kingdom and should not <i>Catch</i>, as the
<i>French</i> Man call'd it. 'Tis in the Sense of the probability
of this miscarriage, that most Men wonder at these unaccountable
Measures, and think the <i>Eagles</i> Councils look a little
Wildish, as if some of his great Men were grown Dilirious and
Whymsical, that fancy'd Crowns and Kingdoms were to come and go,
just as the great Divan at their Court should direct. This
confusion of Circumstances has occasion'd a certain Copy of Verses
to appear about the Moon, which in our Characters may be read as
follows.</p>

<blockquote><i>Wondelis Idulasin na Perixola Metartos,</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Strigunia Crolias Xerin Hytale fylos;</i><br>
<i>Farnicos Galvare Orpto sonamel Egonsberch,</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sih lona Sipos Gullia Ropta Tylos.</i></blockquote>

<p>'Which may be English'd thus.</p>

<blockquote><i>C&aelig;sar you Trifle with the World in vain,</i><br>
<i>Think rather now of</i> Germany <i>than</i> Spain;<br>
<i>He's hardly fit to fill th'</i> Eagle's <i>Throne,</i><br>
<i>Who gives new Crowns, and can't protect his own.</i></blockquote>

<p>'But after all to come closer to the Point, if I can now make it
out that whatever it was before, this very Practice of declaring a
second Son to be King of <i>Ebronia</i>, has publickly own'd the
Proceedings of the King of <i>Gallunaria</i> to be Just, and the
Title of his Grandson to be much better than the Title of the now
declar'd King, what shall we call it then?</p>

<p>'In order to this, 'tis first necessary to examine the Title of
the present King, and to enter into the history of his coming to
the Crown, in which I shall be very Brief.</p>

<p>'The last King of <i>Ebronia</i> dying without Issue, and a
former Renunciation taking place, the Succession devolves on the
House of the <i>Eagle</i> as before, of whom the present
<i>Eagle</i> is the eldest Branch.</p>

<p>'But the late King of <i>Ebronia</i>, to prevent the Succession
of the <i>Eagle</i>'s Line, makes a Will, and supplies the Proviso
of Renunciation by Devising, Giving or Bequeathing the Crown to the
Grandson of his Sister.</p>

<p>'The King of <i>Gallunaria</i> insists that this is a lawful
Title to the Crown, and seizes it accordingly, inflating his
Grandson in the Possession.</p>

<p>'The <i>Eagle</i> alledges the Renunciation to confirm his Title
as Heir; and as to the Will of the late King, he says Crowns cannot
descend by Gift, and tho' the late King had an undoubted Right to
enjoy it himself, he had none to give it away.</p>

<p>'To make the application of this History as short as may be, I
demand then what Right has the <i>Eagle</i> to give it to his
second Son? if Crowns are not to descend by Gift, he may have a
Right to enjoy it, but can have none to give it away, but if he has
a Right to give it away; so had the former King, and then the
present King has a better Title to it than the new one, because his
Gift was Prior to this of the <i>Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>'I would be glad to see this answer'd; and if it can't, then I
Query whether the <i>Eagle's</i> Senses ought not to be question'd,
for setting up a Title very Foundation for which he quarrels at him
that is in Possession, and so confirm the honesty of the
Possessor's Title by his own Practice.?</p>

<p>'From the whole, I make no Scruple to say that either the
<i>Eagle</i>'s second Son has no Title to the Kingdom of
<i>Ebronia</i>, or else giving of Crowns is a legal Practice; and
if Crowns may descend by Gift, then has the other King a better
Title than he, because it was given him first, and the <i>Eagle</i>
has only given away what he had no Right to, because 'twas given
away before he had any Title to it himself.</p>

<p>'Further, the Posterity of the <i>Eagle</i>'s eldest Son are
manifestly injur'd in this Action, for Kings can no more give away
their Crowns from their Posterity, than from themselves; if the
Right be in the <i>Eagle</i>, 'tis his, as he's the eldest Male
Branch of the House of <i>the great Lip</i>, not as he is
<i>Eagle</i>, and from him the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i> by the same
Right of Devolution descends to his Posterity, and rests on the
Male Line of every eldest Branch. If so, no Act of Renunciation can
alter this Succession, for that is a Gift, and the Gift is
exploded, or else the whole House of <i>the great Lip</i> is
excluded; so that let the Argument be turn'd and twisted never so
many ways, it all Centers in this, that the present Person can have
no Title to the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>.</p>

<p>'If he has any Title, 'tis from the Gift of his Father and elder
Brother; if the Gift of a Crown is no good Title, then his Title
cannot be good; If the Gift of a Crown is a good Title, then the
Crown was given away before, and so neither he nor his Father has
any Title.</p>

<p>'Let him that can answer these Paradoxes defend his Title if he
can; and what shall we now say to the War in <i>Ebronia</i>, only
this, that they are going to fight for the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>?
and to take it away from one that has no Right to it, to give it to
one that has a less Right than he, and 'tis to be fear'd that if
Heaven be Righteous, 'twill succeed accordingly.</p>

<p>'The Gentlemen of Letters who have wrote of this in our Lunar
World, on the Subject of the <i>Gallunarians</i> Title, have took a
great deal of Liberty in the <i>Eagle</i>'s behalf, to Banter and
Ridicule the <i>Gallunarian</i> sham of a Title, as if it were a
pretence too weak for any Prince to make use of, to talk of Kings
giving their Crowns by Will.</p>

<p><i>Kingdoms and Governments, says a Learned Lunar author, are
not things of such indifferent Value to be given away, like a Token
left for a Legacy. If any Prince has ever given or transferr'd his
Government, it has been done by solemn Act, and the People have
been call'd to assent and confirm such Concessions</i>.</p>

<p>'Then the same Author goes on, to Treat the King of
<i>Gallunaria</i> with a great deal of Severity, and exposes his
Politicks, that he should think to put upon the Moon with so empty,
so weak, so ridiculous a Pretence, as the Will of a weak Headed
Prince, who neither had a Right to give his Crown, nor a Brain to
know what he was doing, and he laughs to think what the King of
<i>Gallunaria</i> would have said to have such a dull Trick as
that, put upon him in any such Case.</p>

<p>'Now when we have been so Witty upon this very Article, of
giving away the Crown to the King of <i>Gallunaria</i>'s Grandson,
as an incongruous and ridiculous Thing, shall we come to make the
same Incongruity be the Foundation of a War?</p>

<p>'With what Justice can we make a War for a Prince who has only a
good Title, by Vertue of the self same Action which makes the
Grandson of his Enemy have a bad Title.</p>

<p>'I always thought we had a Just Ground to make War on
<i>Ebronia</i>, as we were bound by former Alliances to assist the
<i>Eagle</i> in the recovery of it in case of the death of the late
King of that Country.</p>

<p>'But now the <i>Eagle</i> has refus'd the Succession, and his
Eldest Son has refus'd it, I would be glad to see it prov'd how the
second Son can have a Title, and yet the other King have no
Title.</p>

<p>'What a strange sort of a Thing is the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i>,
that two of the greatest Princes of the Lunar World should Fight,
not who shall have it, for neither of them will accept of it, but
who shall have the Power of giving it away.</p>

<p>'Here are four Princes refuse it; the King of
<i>Gallunaria</i>'s Sons had a Title in Right of their Mother, and
'twas not the former Renunciations that would have barr'd them, if
this softer way had not been found out; for time was it has been
pleaded on behalf of the eldest Son of the <i>Gallunarian</i> King,
that his Mother could not give away his Right before he was
born.</p>

<p>'Then the <i>Eagle</i> has a Right, and under him his eldest
Son; and none of all these four will accept of the Crown; I believe
all the Moon can't find four more that would refuse it.</p>

<p>'Now, tho' none of these think it worth accepting themselves,
yet they fall out about the Right of giving it away. The King of
<i>Gallunaria</i> will not accept of it himself, but he gets a Gift
from the last Incumbent. This, says the <i>Eagle</i>, can't be a
good Title, for the late King had no Right to make a Deed of Gift
of the Crown, since a King is only Tennant for Life, and Succession
of Crowns either must descend by a Lineal Progression in the Right
of Primogeniture, or else they lose the Tenure, and devolve on the
People.</p>

<p>'Now as this Argument holds good the <i>Eagle</i> has an
undoubted Title to the Crown of <i>Ebronia:</i> But then, says his
<i>Eaglish Majesty</i>, I cannot accept of the Crown my self for I
am the <i>Eagle</i>, and my eldest Son has two Kingdoms already,
and is in a fair way to be <i>Eagle</i> after me, and 'tis not
worth while for him, but I have a second Son, and we will give it
him.</p>

<p>'Now may the King of <i>Gallunaria</i> say, if one Gift is good,
another is good, and ours is the first Gift, and therefore we will
keep it; and tho' I solemnly declare I should be very sorry to see
the Crown of <i>Ebronia</i> rest in the House of the
<i>Gallunarian</i>, because our Trade will suffer exceedingly; yet
if never so much damage were to come of it, we ought to do Justice
in the World; if neither the <i>Eagle</i> nor his eldest Son will
be King of <i>Ebronia</i>, but a Deed of Gift shall be made, the
first Gift has the Right, for nothing can be given away to two
People at once, and 'tis apparent that the late King had as much
Right to give it away as any Body.</p>

<p>'The poor <i>Ebronians</i> are in a fine Condition all this
while, that no Body concerns them in the Matter; neither Party has
so much as thought it worth while to ask them who they would have
to Reign over them, here has been no Assembly, <i>no Cortez</i>, no
Meeting of the People of <i>Ebronia</i>, neither Collectively or
Representatively, no general Convention of the Nobility, no House
of Feathers, but <i>Ebronia</i> lies as the spoil of the Victor
wholly passive, and her People and Princes, as if they were wholly
unconcern'd, lie by and look on, whoever is like to be King, they
are like to suffer deeply by the Strife, and yet neither side has
thought fit to consult them about it.</p>

<p>'The conclusion of the whole Matter is in short this, here is
certainly a false Step taken, how it shall be rectify'd is not the
present Business, nor am I Wise enough to Prescribe. One Man may do
in a Moment what all the Lunar World cannot undo in an Age. 'Tis
not be thought the <i>Eagle</i> will be prevail'd on to undo it,
nay he has Sworn not to alter it.</p>

<p>'I am not concern'd to prove the Title of the present King of
<i>Ebronia</i>, no, nor of the <i>Eagles</i> neither; but I think I
can never be answer'd in this, that this Gift of the <i>Eagles</i>
to his second Son is preposterous, inconsistent with all his Claim
to the Crown, and the greatest confirmation of the Title of his
Enemy that it was possible to give, and no doubt the
<i>Gallunarians</i> will lay hold of the Argument.</p>

<p>'If this Prince was the <i>Eagle's</i> eldest Son, he might have
a Just Right from the concession of his Father, because the Right
being inherent, he only receiv'd from him an Investiture of Time,
but as this young Gentleman is a second Son he has no more Right,
his elder Brother being alive, than your <i>Grand Seignior</i>, or
<i>Czar</i> of <i>Muscovy</i> in your World.</p>

<p>'Let them Fight then for such a Cause, who valuing only the Pay,
make War a Trade, and Fight for any thing they are bid to Fight
for, and as such value not the Justice of the War, nor trouble
their Heads about Causes and Consequences, so they have their Pay,
'tis well enough for them.</p>

<p>'But were the Justice of the War examin'd, I can see none, this
Declaring a new King who has no Right but by a Gift, and pulling
down one that had it by a Gift before, has so much Contradiction in
it, that I am afraid no Wise Man, or Honest Man will embark in
it.</p>
<pre>
     <i>Your</i>
         <i>Humble Servant,</i>
             <i>The Man in the Moon.</i>
</pre>

<p>I wou'd have no Body now pretend to scandalize the Writer of
this Letter, which being for the <i>Gallunarians</i>, for no <i>Man
in the Moon</i> had more Aversion for them than he, but he would
have had the War carry'd on upon a right Bottom, Justice and
Honesty regarded in it, and as he said often, they had no need to
go out of the Road of Justice, for had they made War <i>in the
great Eagle's Name</i> all had been well.</p>

<p>Nor was he a false Prophet, for as this was ill grounded, so it
was as ill carry'd on, met with <i>Shocks</i>, <i>Rubs</i> and
<i>Disappointments</i> every way. The very first Voyage the new
King made, he had like to ha' been drown'd by a very violent
Tempest, things not very usual in those Countries; and all the
Progress that had been made in his behalf when I came away from
<i>that Lunar World</i>, had not brought him so much as to be able
to set his Foot upon his new Kingdom of <i>Ebronia</i>, but his
Adversary by wonderful Dexterity, and the Assistance of his old
Grandfather the <i>Gallunarian</i> Monarch, beat his Troops upon
all Occasions, invaded his Ally that pretended to assist him, and
kept a quiet Possession of all the vast <i>Ebronian Monarchy</i>;
and but at last by the powerful Diversion of the <i>Solunarian</i>
Fleet, a Shock was given them on another Side, which if it had not
happen'd, it was thought the new King had been sent home again
<i>Re Infecta</i>.</p>

<p>Being very much Shockt in my Judgment of this Affair, by these
unanswerable Reasons; I enquir'd of my Author who were the
Directors of this Matter? he told me plainly it was done by those
great States Men, which the <i>Solunarian</i> Queen had lately very
Justly turn'd out, whose Politicks were very unaccountable in a
great many other things, as well as in that.</p>

<p>'Tis true, the War was carry'd on under the new Ministry, and no
War in the World can be Juster, on account of the Injustice and
Encroachment of the <i>Gallunarian</i> Monarch.</p>

<p>The Queen therefore and her present Ministers, go on with the
War on Principles of Confederacy; 'tis the business of the
<i>Solunarians</i> to beat the Invader out, and then let the People
come and make a fair Decision who they will have to Reign over
them.</p>

<p>This indeed justifies the War in <i>Ebronia</i> to be Right, but
for the Personal Proceedure as before, 'tis all Contradiction and
can never be answer'd.</p>

<p>I hope no Man will be so malicious, as to say I am hereby
reflecting on our War with <i>Spain</i>. I am very forward to say,
it is a most Just and Reasonable War, as to paralels between the
Case of the Princes, in defending the Matter of Personal Right,
<i>Hic labor, Hoc opus</i>.</p>

<p>Thus however you see <i>Humanum eft Errare</i>, whether in this
World or in the Moon, 'tis all one, Infallibility of Councels any
more than of Doctrine, is not in Man.</p>

<p>The Reader may observe, I have formerly noted there was a new
Consolidator to be Built, and observ'd what struggle there was in
the Moon about choosing the Feathers.</p>

<p>I cannot omit some further Remarks here, as</p>

<p>1. It is to be observ'd, that this last Consolidator was in a
manner quite worn out.----- It had indeed continu'd but 3 Year,
which was the stated Time by Law, but it had been so
<i>Hurry'd</i>, so <i>Party Rid</i>, so often had been up in <i>the
Moon</i>, and made <i>so many</i> such <i>extravagant Flights</i>,
and unnecessary <i>Voyages thither</i>, that it began to be
exceedingly <i>worn</i> and defective.</p>

<p>2. This occasion'd that the light fluttering Feathers, and the
fermented Feathers <i>made strange Work of it</i>; nay, sometimes
they were so hot, they were like to ha' ruin'd the whole Fabrick,
and had it not been for the <i>great Feather</i> in the Center, and
a few <i>Negative</i> Feathers who were Wiser than the rest, all
the <i>Machines</i> had been broke to pieces, and the whole Nation
put into a most strange Confusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes their Motion was <i>so violent an precipitant</i>,
that there was great apprehensions of its being <i>set on Fire by
its own Velocity</i>, for swiftness of Motion is allow'd by the
Sages and <i>so so's</i> to produce <i>Fire</i> as in
<i>Wheels</i>, <i>Mills</i> and several sorts of <i>Mechanick
Engines</i> which are frequently Fir'd, and so in <i>Thoughts</i>,
<i>Brains</i>, <i>Assemblies</i>, <i>Consolidators</i>, and all
such combustible Things.</p>

<p>Indeed these things were of great Consequence, and therefore
require some more nice Examination than ordinary, and the following
Story will in part explain it.</p>

<p>Among the rest of the Broils they had with the <i>Grandees</i>,
one happen'd on this occasion.</p>

<p>One of the Tacking <i>Feathers</i> being accidentally met by a
<i>Grandee</i>'s Footman, whom it seems wanted some Manners, the
Slave began to haloo him in the Street, with a Tacker, a Tacker, a
<i>Feather</i>-Fool, a Tacker, <i>&amp;c.</i> and so brought the
Mob about him, and had not the <i>Grandee</i> himself come in the
very interim, and rescu'd the <i>Feather</i>, the Mob had demolisht
him, they were so enrag'd.</p>

<p>As this Gentleman-<i>Feather</i> was rescu'd with great
Courtesie by the <i>Grandee</i>, taken into his Coach and carry'd
home to his House, he desir'd to speak with the Footman.</p>

<p>The Fellow being call'd in, was ask't by him who employ'd him,
or set him on to offer him this Insult? the Footman being a ready
bold Fellow, told him no Body Sir, but you are all grown so
ridiculous to the whole Nation, that if the 134 of you were left
but to us Footmen, and it was not in more respect to our Masters,
than you, we should Cure you of ever coming into the
<i>Consolidator</i> again, and all the People in the Moon are of
our Mind.</p>

<p>But says the <i>Feather</i>, why do you call me Fool too? why
Sir, says he, because no Body could ever tell us what it was you
drove at, and we ha' been told you never knew your selves; now if
one of you Tacking <i>Feathers</i> would but tell the World what
your real Design was, they would be satisfy'd, but to be leaders in
the <i>Consolidator</i>, and to Act without Meaning, without
Thought or Design, must argue your' Fools, or worse, and you will
find all the Moon of my Mind.</p>

<p>But what if we had a meaning, says the <i>Feather</i>-Man? why
then, says the Footman, we shall leave calling you Fools, and call
you Knaves, for it could never be an Honest one, so that you had
better stand as you do: and I make it out thus.</p>

<p>You knew, that upon your Tacking the <i>Crolians</i> to the
Tribute Bill, the <i>Grandees</i> must reject both, they having
declar'd against reading any Bills Tackt together, as being against
their Priviledges. Now if you had any Design, it must be to have
the Bill of Tribute lost, and that must be to disappoint all the
publick Affairs, expose the Queen, break all Measures, discourage
the Confederates, and putting all things backward, bring the
<i>Gallunarian</i> Forces upon them, and put all <i>Solunaria</i>
into Confusion. Now Sir, says he, we cannot have such course
Thoughts of you, as to believe you could design such dark,
mischievous things as these, and therefore we chose to believe you
all Fools, and not fit to be put into a <i>Consolidator</i> again;
than Knaves and Traytors to your Country, and consequently fit for
a worse Place.</p>

<p>The plainness of the Footman was such, and so unanswerable, that
his Master was fain to check him, and so the Discourse broke off,
and we shall leave it there, and proceed to the Story.</p>

<p>The Men of the Feather as I have noted, who are represented here
by the <i>Consolidator</i>, fell all together by the Ears, and
<i>all the Moon</i> was in a combustion. The Case was as
follows.</p>

<p>They had three times lost <i>their quallifying Law</i>, and
particularly they observ'd the <i>Grandees</i> were the Men that
threw it out, and notwithstanding <i>the Plot of the Tackers</i>,
as they call'd them, who were <i>as I noted</i>, observ'd to be in
Conjunction <i>with the Crolians</i>, yet the Law always past
<i>the Feathers</i>, but still the <i>Grandees</i> quasht it.</p>

<p>To show their Resentment <i>at the Grandees</i>, they had often
made <i>attempts to mortify them</i>, sometimes Arraigning them in
general, sometimes <i>Impeaching private Members</i> of their
House, but still all wou'd not do, the <i>Grandees</i> had the
better of them, and going on with Regularity and Temper, the
<i>Consolidators</i> or Feather-Men always had the worst, the
<i>Grandees had the applause of all the Moon</i>, had <i>the last
Blow</i> on every Occasion, and the other sunk in their Reputation
exceedingly.</p>

<p>It is necessary to understand here, that the Men of the Feather
serve in several Capacities, and under several Denominations, and
<i>act by themselves</i>, singly consider'd, they are call'd <i>the
Consolidator</i>, and the Feathers we mention'd abstracted from
their Persons, make the glorious Engine we speak of, and in which,
when any suddain Motion takes them, they can all shut themselves
up, and away for the Moon.</p>

<p>But when these are <i>joyn'd with the Grandees, and the
Queen</i>, so United, they make a great <i>Cortez</i>, or general
Collection of all the Governing Authority of the Nation.</p>

<p>When this last Fraction happen'd, the <i>Men of the Feather</i>
were under an exceeding Ferment, they had in some Passion taken
into their Custody, some good Honest <i>Lunar Country-Men</i>, for
an Offence, which indeed few but themselves ever immagin'd was a
Crime, for the poor Men did nothing but pursue their own Right by
the Law.</p>

<p>'Tis thought the Men of the Feather soon saw they were in the
Wrong, but acted like some Men in our World, that when they make a
mistake, being too Proud to own themselves in the wrong, run
themselves into worse Errors to mend it.</p>

<p>So <i>these Lunar Gentlemen</i> disdaining to have it said they
<i>could be mistaken</i>, committed two Errors to conceal one,
'till at last they came to be laught at by <i>all the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>These poor Men having lain a long while in Prison, for little or
no Crime, at last were advis'd to apply themselves <i>to the Law
for Discharge</i>; the Law would fairly have Discharg'd them; for
<i>in that Country</i>, no Man may be Imprison'd, but he must in a
certain Time be Tryed, or let go upon pledges of his Friends,
<i>much like our giving Bail on a Writ of Habeas Corpus</i>; but
the Judges, whether over-aw'd by the Feathers, or what was the
Cause, Authors have not determin'd, did not care to venture
Discharging them.</p>

<p>The poor Men thus remanded, apply'd themselves <i>to the
Grandees</i> who were then Sitting, and who are <i>the Soveraign
Judicature</i> of the Country, and before whom Appeals lie from all
Courts of Justice. <i>The Grandees</i> as in Duty bound, appear'd
ready to do them Justice, but the Queen was to be apply'd to, first
to grant a Writ, or a Warrant for a Writ, call'd in their Country
<i>a Writ of Follies</i>, which is as much as to say Mistakes.</p>

<p>The <i>Consolidators</i> foreseeing the Consequence, immediately
apply'd themselves to the Queen with an Address, the Terms of which
were so <i>Undu----l</i> and <i>Unman--ly</i>, that had she not
been a Queen of unusual Candor and Goodness, she would have Treated
them as they deserv'd, for they upbraided her with their Freedom
and Readiness in granting her Supplies, and therefore as good as
told her they expected she should do as they desir'd.</p>

<p>These People that knew the Supplies given, were from
<i>necessity, Legal</i>, and for their <i>own Defence</i>, while
the granting their Request, must have been <i>Illegal</i>,
<i>Arbitrary</i>, a <i>Dispensing</i> with the Laws, and <i>denying
Justice</i> to her Subjects, <i>the very thing they ruin'd her
Father for</i>, were justly provok'd to see their good Queen so
barbarously Treated.</p>

<p>The Queen full of Goodness and Calmness, gave them a gentle kind
Answer, but told them she must be careful to Act with due Regard to
the Laws, and could not interrupt the course of Judicial
Proceedings; and at the same time granted the Writ, having first
consulted with her Council, and receiv'd the Opinion of all the
Judges, that it was not only Safe, but Just and Reasonable, and a
Right to her People which she could not deny.</p>

<p>This Proceeding gall'd the Feathers to the quick, and finding
the <i>Grandees</i> resolv'd to proceed Judicially upon the said
<i>Writ of Follies</i>, which if they did, the Prisoners would be
deliver'd and the Follies fixt upon the Feathers, they sent their
Poursuivants took them out of the Common Prison, and convey'd them
separately and privately into Prisons of their own.</p>

<p>This rash and unprecedented Proceedings, pusht them farther into
a Labrinth, from whence it was impossible they could ever find
their way out, but with infinite Loss to their Reputation, like a
Sheep in a thick Wood, that at every Briar pulls some of the Wool
from her Back, till she comes out in a most scandalous Pickle of
Nakedness and Scratches.</p>

<p>The <i>Grandees</i> immediately publisht six Articles in
Vindication of the Peoples Right, against the assum'd Priviledges
of the <i>Feathers</i>, the Abstract of which is as follows.</p>

<p>1. That the <i>Feathers</i> had no Right to Claim, or make any
new Priviledges for themselves, other than they had before.</p>

<p>2. That every Freeman of the Moon had a Right to repel Injury
with Law.</p>

<p>3. That Imprisoning the 5 Countrymen by the <i>Feathers</i>, was
assuming a new Priviledge they had no Right to, and a subjecting
the Subjects Right to their Arbitrary Votes.</p>

<p>4. That a <i>Writ of Deliverance</i>, or removing the Body, is
the legal Right of every Subject in the Moon, in order to his
Liberty, in case of Imprisonment.</p>

<p>5. That to punish any Person for assisting the Subjects, in
procuring or prosecuting the said <i>Writ of Deliverance</i>, is a
breach of the Laws, and a thing of dangerous Consequence.</p>

<p>6. That a <i>Writ of Follies</i> is not a Grace, but a Right,
and ought not to be deny'd to the Subject.</p>

<p>These Resolves struck the languishing Reputation of the
<i>Feathers</i> with the dead Palsie, and they began to stink in
the Nostrils of all the Nations in the Moon.</p>

<p>But besides this, they had one strange effect, which was a
prodigious disappointment to the Men of the <i>Feather</i>.</p>

<p>I had observ'd before, that there was to be a new Set of
<i>Feathers</i>, provided in order to Building another
<i>Consolidator</i>, according to a late Law for a new Engine every
three Years. Now several of these Men of the <i>Feather</i>, who
thought their <i>Feathers</i> capable of serving again, had made
great Interest, and been at great Cost to have their old
<i>Feathers</i> chosen again, but the People had entertain'd such
scoundrel Opinions of these Proceedings, such as Tacking,
<i>Consolidating</i>, Imprisoning Electors, Impeaching without
Tryal, <i>Writs of Follies</i> and the like, that if any one was
known to be concern'd in any of these things, no Body would Vote
for him.</p>

<p>The Gentlemen were so mortify'd at this, that even the hottest
High-Church <i>Solunarian</i> of them all, if he put in any where
to be re-chosen, the first thing he had to do, was to assure the
People he was no Tacker, none of the 134, and a vast deal of
difficulty they had to Purge themselves of this blessed Action,
which they us'd to value themselves on before, as their Glory and
Merit.</p>

<p>Thus they grew asham'd of it as a Crime, got Men to go about to
vouch for them to the Country People, that they were no Tackers,
nay, one of them to clear himself loudly forswore it, and taking a
Glass of Wine wisht it might never pass thro' him, if he was a
Tacker, tho' all Men suspected him to be of that Number too, he
having been one of the forwardest that way on all Occasions, of any
Person among the <i>South Folk of the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>In like manner, one of the <i>Feathers</i> for the <i>middle
Province</i> of the Country, who us'd to think it his Honour to be
for the qualifying Law, seeing which way the humour of the Country
ran, took as much Pains now to tell the People he was no Tacker, as
he did before, to promise them that he would do his utmost to have
the <i>Crolians</i> reduc'd, and that Bill to pass, the Reason of
which was plain, that he saw if it should be known he was a Tacker,
he should never have his <i>Feather</i> return'd to be put into the
<i>Consolidator</i>.</p>

<p>The Heats and Feuds that the <i>Feathers</i> and the
<i>Grandees</i> were now run into, began to make the latter very
uneasie, and they sent to the <i>Grandees</i> to hasten them, and
put them in mind of passing some Laws they had sent up to them for
raising Mony, and which lay before them, knowing that as soon as
those Laws were past, the Queen would break 'em up, and they being
very willing to be gone, before these things came too far upon the
Stage, urg'd them to dispatch.</p>

<p>But the <i>Grandees</i> resolving to go thoro' with the Matter,
sent to them to come to a Treaty on the foot of the six Articles,
and to bring any Reasons they could, to prove the Power they had to
Act as they had done with the Country-men, and with the Lawyers
they had put in Prison for assisting them.</p>

<p>The <i>Feathers</i> were very backward and stiff about this
Conference, or Treaty, 'till at last the <i>Grandees</i> having
sufficiently expos'd them to all the Nation, the Bills were past,
the <i>Grandees</i> caus'd the particulars to be Printed, and a
Representation of their Proceedings, and the <i>Feathers</i> foul
Dealings to the Queen of the Country, and so her Majesty sent them
Home.</p>

<p>But if they were asham'd of being call'd Tackers before, they
were doubly mortify'd at this now, nay the Country resented it so
exceedingly, that some of them began to consider whether they
should venture to go Home or no; Printed Lists of their Names were
Publish'd, tho' we do not say they were true Lists, for it was a
hard thing to know which were true Lists, and which were not, nor
indeed could a true List be made, no Man being able to retain the
exact Account of who were the Men in his Memory.</p>

<p>For as there were 134 Tackers, so there were 141 of these, who
by a Name of Distinction, were call'd <i>Lebusyraneim</i>, in
<i>English Ailesbury-men</i>.</p>

<p>The People were so exasperated against these, that they
express'd their Resentment upon all Occasions, and least the Queen
should think that the Nation approv'd the Proceedings, they drew up
a Representation or Complaint, full of most dutiful Expressions to
their Queen, and full of Resentment against the <i>Feathers</i>,
the Copy of which being handed about the Moon the last time I was
there, I shall take the Pains to put it into <i>English</i> in the
best manner I can, keeping as near the Originial as possible.</p>

<p>If any Man shall now wickedly suggest, that this Relation has
any retrospect to the Affairs of <i>England</i>, the Author
declares them malitious Misconstruers of his honest Relation of
Matters from this remote Country, and offers his positive Oath for
their Satisfaction, that the very last Journy he made into those
Lunar Regions, this Matter was upon the Stage, of which, if this
Treatise was not so near its conclusion, the Reader might expect a
more particular Account.</p>

<p>If there is any Analogy or similitude between the Transactions
of either World, he cannot account for that, 'tis application makes
the Ass.</p>

<p>And yet sometimes he has thought, as some People Fable of the
Platonick Year, that after such a certain Revolution of Time, all
Things are Transacted over again, and the same People live again,
are the fame Fools, Knaves, Philosophers and Mad-men they were
before, tho' without any Knowledge of, or Retrospect to what they
acted before; so why should it be impossible, that as the Moon and
this World are noted before to be Twins and Sisters, equal in
Motion and in Influence, and perhaps in Qualities, the same secret
Power should so act them, as that <i>like</i> Actions and
Circumstances should happen in all Parts of both Worlds at the same
time.</p>

<p>I leave this Thought to the improvement of our Royal Learned
Societies of the <i>Anticacofanums</i>, <i>Opposotians</i>,
<i>Periodicarians</i>, <i>Antepredestinarians</i>, Universal
<i>Soulians</i>, and such like unfathomable People, who, without
question, upon mature Enquiry will find out the Truth of this
Matter.</p>

<p>But if any one shall scruple the Matter of Fact as I have here
related it, I freely give him leave to do as I did, and go up to
the Moon for a Demonstration; and if upon his return he does not
give ample Testimony to the Case in every part of it, as here
related, I am content to pass for the Contriver of it my self, and
be punish'd as the Law shall say I deserve.</p>

<p>Nor was this all the publick Matters, in which this Nation of
<i>Solunarians</i> took wrong Measures, for about this time, the
Misunderstandings between the Southern and Northern Men began
again, and the <i>Solunarians</i> made several Laws, as they call'd
them, to secure themselves against the Dangers they pretended might
accrue from the new Measures the <i>Nolunarians</i> had taken; but
so unhappily were they blinded by the strife among themselves, and
by-set by Opinion and Interest, that every Law they made, or so
much as attempted to make, was really to the Advantage, and to the
Interest of the Northern-Men, and to their own loss; so Ignorantly
and Weak-headed was these <i>High Solunarian</i> Church-Men in the
true Interest of their Country, led by their implacable Malice at
<i>Crolianism</i>, which as is before noted, was the Establisht
Religion of that Country.</p>

<p>But as this Matter was but Transacting when I took the other
Remarks, and that I did not obtain a full Understanding of it,
'till my second Voyage, I refer it to a more full Relation of my
farther Travels that way, when I shall not fail to give a clear
State of the Debate of the two Kingdoms, in which the Southern Men
had the least Reason, and the worst Success that ever they had in
any Affair of that Nature for many Years before.</p>

<p>It was always my Opinion in Affairs <i>on this side the
Moon</i>, that tho' sometimes a foolish Bolt may hit the Point, and
a random Shot kill the Enemy, yet that generally Discretion and
Prudence of Mannagement, had the Advantage, and met with a
proportion'd Success, find things were, or were not happy, in their
Conclusion as they were, more or less wisely Contriv'd and
Directed.</p>

<p>And tho' it may not be allow'd to be so here, yet I found it
more constantly so there, Effects were true to their Causes, and
confusion of Councils never fail'd <i>in the Moon</i> to be
follow'd by distracted and destructive Consequences.</p>

<p>This appear'd more eminently in the Dispute between these two
Lunar Nations we are speaking of; never were People in the Moon,
<i>whatever they might be in other Places</i>, so divided in their
Opinions about a matter of such Consequence. Some were for
declaring War immediately upon the Northern Men, tho' they could
show no Reason at all why, only because they would not do as they
would have 'em; <i>a parcel of poor Scoundrel, Scabby Rogues</i>,
they ought to be made submit, <i>what</i>! won't they declare the
same King as we do! <i>hang them Rogues</i>! <i>a pack of Crolian
Prestarian Devils</i>, we must make them do it, <i>down with them
the shortest Way</i>, declare War immediately, and <i>down with
them</i>.------ Nay some were for falling on them directly, without
the formality of declaring War.</p>

<p>Others, more afraid than hurt, cry'd out Invasions, Depredation,
Fire and Sword, the Northern Men would be upon them immediately,
and propos'd to Fortify their Frontiers, and file off their Forces
to the Borders; nay, so apprehensive did those Men of Prudence
pretend to be, that they order'd Towns to be Fortify'd 100 <i>Mile
off of the Place</i>, when all this while the poor Northern Men did
nothing but tell them, that unless they would come to Terms, they
would not have the same King as they, and they took some Measures
to let them see they did not purpose to be forc'd to it.</p>

<p>Another sort of Wiser Men than these, propos'd to Unite with
them, hear their Reasons, and do them Right. These indeed were the
only Men that were in the right Method of concluding this unhappy
Broil, and for that Reason, were the most unlikely to succeed.</p>

<p>But the Wildest Notion of all, was, when some of the
<i>Grandees</i> made a grave Address to the Queen of the Country,
to desire the Northern Men to settle Matters first, and to tell
them, that when that was done, <i>they should see what these would
do for them</i>. This was a home Stroke, if it had but hit, and the
Misfortune only lay in this, <i>That the Northern Men were not
Fools enough</i>; the clearness of the Air in those cold Climates
generally clearing the Head so early, that those People see much
farther into a Mill-stone than <i>any Blind Man in all the Southern
Nations of the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>There was an another unhappiness in this Case, which made the
Matter yet more confus'd, and that was, that the Souldiers had
generally no gust to this War.--- This was an odd Case; for those
sort of Gentlemen, especially <i>in the World in the Moon</i>,
don't use to enquire into the Justice of the Case they Fight for,
but they reckon 'tis their Business to go where they are sent, and
kill any Body they are order'd to kill, leaving their Governors to
answer for the Justice of it; but there was another Reason to be
given why <i>the Men of the Sword</i> were so averse, and always
talk't coldly of the fighting Part, and tho' the Northern Men
call'd it fear, yet I cannot joyn with them in that, for <i>to
fear</i> requires Thinking; and some of our <i>Solunarians</i> are
absolutely protected from the first, because they never meddle with
the last, <i>except when they come to the Engine</i>, and therefore
'tis plain it could not proceed from Fear.</p>

<p>It has puzzl'd the most discerning Heads of the Age, to give a
Reason from whence this Aversion proceeded, and various Judgments
have been given of it.</p>

<p>The <i>Nolunarians</i> jested with them, and when they talk't of
Fighting, bad them look back into History, and examine what they
ever made of a <i>Nolunarian War</i>, and whether they had not been
often well beaten, and sent short home, bid them have a care <i>of
catching a Tartar</i>, as we call it, and always made themselves
merry with it.</p>

<p>They banter'd the <i>Solunarians</i> too, about the Fears and
Terrors they were under, from their Arming themselves, and putting
themselves in a posture of Defence,----- When it was easy to see by
the nature of the thing, that their Design was <i>not a War, but a
Union</i> upon just Conditions, that it was a plain Token that they
design'd either to put some affront upon <i>the Nolunarians</i>, to
deny them some just Claims, or to impose something very Provoking
upon them more than they had yet done, that they were so exceeding
fearful of an Invasion from them.</p>

<p>Tho' these were sufficient to pass for Reasons in other Cases,
yet it could not be so here, but I saw there must be something else
in it. As I was thus wondering at this unusual backwardness of the
Souldiers, I enquir'd a little farther into the meaning of it, and
quickly found the Reason was plain, <i>there was nothing to be got
by it</i>, that People were <i>Brave</i>, <i>Desperate</i> and
<i>Poor</i>, the Country <i>Barren</i>, Mountainous and
<i>Empty</i>, so that in short there would be nothing but Blows,
and <i>Souldiers Fellows</i> to be had, and I always observ'd that
Souldiers never care to be knockt on the Head, and get nothing by
the Bargain.</p>

<p>In short, I saw plainly the Reasons that prompted the
<i>Solunarians</i> to Insult their Neighbours of the North, were
more deriv'd from the regret at their Establishing
<i>Crolianism</i>, than at any real Causes they had given, or
indeed were in a condition to give them.</p>

<p>These, and abundance more particular Observations I made, but as
I left the thing still in agitation, and undetermin'd, I shall
refer it to another Voyage which I purpose to make thither, and at
my return, may perhaps set that Case in a clearer Light than our
Sight can yet bear to look at it in.</p>

<p>If in my second Vovage I should undeceive People in the Notions
they entertain'd of those Northern People, and convince them that
the <i>Solunarians</i> were really the Aggressors, and had put
great hardships upon them, I might possibly do a Work, that if it
met with Encouragement, might bring the <i>Solunarians</i> to do
them Justice, and that would set all to Rights, the two Nations
might easily become one, and Unite for ever, or at least become
Friends, and give mutual Assistance to each other; and I cannot but
own such an Agreement would make them both very formidable, but
this I refer to another time.-----</p>

<p>At the same time I cannot leave it without a Remark that this
Jealousy between the two Nations, may perhaps in future Ages be
necessary to be maintain'd, in order to find some better Reasons
for <i>Fortifications</i>, <i>Standing Armies</i>, <i>Guards and
Garisons</i> than could be given in the Reign of the great Prince I
speak of, the Queen's Predecessor, tho' his was against Forreign
insulting Enemy.</p>

<p>But the Temper of the <i>Solunarian High Party</i> was always
such, that they would with much more case give thanks for a
Standing Army against the <i>Nolunarians and Crolians</i>, than
agree to one Legion against the <i>Abrogratzians</i> and
<i>Gallunarians</i>.</p>

<p>But of these Things I am also promis'd a more particular Account
upon my Journy into that Country.</p>

<p>I cannot however conclude this Matter, without giving some
Account of my private Observations, upon what was farther to be
seen in this Country.</p>

<p>And had not my Remarks on their State Matters taken up more of
my Thoughts than I expected, I might have entred a little upon
their other Affairs, such as their <i>Companies</i>, their
<i>Commerce</i>, their <i>Publick Offices</i>, their
<i>Stock-Jobbers</i>, their <i>Temper</i>, their
<i>Conversation</i>, their <i>Women</i>, their <i>Stages</i>,
<i>Universities</i>, their <i>Courtiers</i>, their <i>Clergy</i>,
and the Characters of <i>the severals</i> under all these
Denominations, but these must be referr'd to time, and my more
perfect Observations.</p>

<p>But I cannot omit, that tho' I have very little Knowledge of
Books, and had obtain'd less upon their Language, yet I could not
but be very inquisitive after their Libraries and Men of
Letters.</p>

<p>Among their Libraries I found not abundance of their own Books,
their Learning having so much of Demonstration, and being very
Hieroglyphical, but I found to my great Admiration vast quantities
of Translated Books out of all Languages of our World.</p>

<p>As I thought my self one of the first, at least of our Nation,
that ever came thus far; it was, you may be sure no small surprize
to me to find all the most valluable parts of Modern Learning,
especially of Politicks, Translated from our Tongue, into the Lunar
Dialect, and stor'd up in their Libraries with the Remarks, Notes
and Observations of the Learned Men of that Climate upon the
Subject.</p>

<p>Here, among a vast croud of <i>French</i> Authors condemn'd in
this polite World for trifling, came a huge Volume containing,
<i>Les Oevres de scavans</i>, which has 19 small Bells painted upon
the Book of several disproportion'd sizes.</p>

<p>I enquir'd the meaning of that Hieroglyphick, which the Master
of the Books told me, was to signify that the substance was all
Jingle and Noise, and that of 30 Volumes which that one Book
contains, 29 of them have neither Substance, Musick, Harmony nor
value in them.</p>

<p>The History of the Fulsoms, or a Collection of 300 fine Speeches
made in the <i>French</i> Accademy at <i>Paris</i>, and 1500 gay
Flourishes out of Monsieur <i>Boileau</i>, all in Praise of the
invincible Monarch of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Bavaria</i>'s Manifesto, shewing the Right of
making War against our Sovereigns, from whence the People of that
Lunar World have noted that the same Reasons which made it lawful
to him to attempt the Imperial Power, entitle him to lose his own,
<i>viz.</i> Conquest, and the longest Sword.</p>

<p><i>Jack a both Sides</i>, or a Dialogue between <i>Pasquin</i>
and <i>Marforio</i>, upon the Subject Matter of the Pope's
sincerity in Case of the War in <i>Italy</i>. Written by a Citizen
of <i>Ferrara</i>. One side arguing upon the occasion of the Pope's
General wheedling the Imperialists to quit that Country. The other
bantering Imperial Policy, or the <i>Germains</i> pretending they
were Trickt out of <i>Italy</i>, when they could stay there no
longer.</p>

<p><i>Lewis</i> the Invincible, by Monsieur <i>Boileau</i>. A Poem,
on the Glory of his most Christian Majesties Arms at
<i>Hochstedt</i>, and <i>Verue</i>.</p>

<p>All these Translations have innumerable Hyerogliphical Notes,
and Emblems painted on them, which pass as Comments, and are
readily understood in that Climate. For Example, on the Vol. of
Dialogues are two Cardinals washing the Pope's Hands under a Cloud
that often bespatters them with Blood, signifying that in spight of
all his Pretensions he has a Hand in the Broils of <i>Italy</i>.
And before him the Sun setting in a Cloud, and a Blind
Ballad-Singer making Sonnets upon the brightness of its Lustre.</p>

<p>The three Kings of <i>Brentford</i>, being some Historical
Observations on three mighty Monarchs in our World, whose Heroick
Actions may be the Subject of future Ages, being like to do little
in this, the King of <i>England</i>, King of <i>Poland</i>, and
King of <i>Spain</i>. These are describ'd by a Figure, representing
a Castle in the Air, and three Knights pointing at it, but they
<i>could not catch</i>.</p>

<p>I omit abundance of very excellent pieces, because remote, as
three great Volumes of <i>European</i> Misteries, among the vast
varieties of which, and very entertaining, I observ'd but a few,
such as these:</p>

<p>1. Why Prince <i>Ragotski</i> will make no Peace with the
Emperor.--- But more particularly why the Emperor won't make Peace
with him.</p>

<p>2. Where the Policy of the King of <i>Sweden</i> lies, to persue
the King of <i>Poland</i>, and let the <i>Muscovites</i> ravage and
destroy his own Subjects.</p>

<p>3. What the Duke of <i>Bavaria</i> propos'd to himself in
declaring for <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>4. Why the Protestants of the Confederacy never reliev'd the
<i>Camisars</i>.</p>

<p>5. Why there are no Cowards found in the <i>English</i> Service,
but among their Sea Captains.</p>

<p>6. Why the King of <i>Portugal</i> did not take <i>Madrid</i>,
why the <i>English</i> did not take <i>Cadiz</i>, and why the
<i>Spaniards</i> did not take <i>Gibraltar</i>, viz. because the
first were Fools, the second Knaves, and the last
<i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>7. What became of all the Silver taken at <i>Vigo</i>.</p>

<p>8. Who will be the next King of <i>Scotland</i>.</p>

<p>9. If <i>England</i> should ever want a King, who would think it
worth while to accept of it.</p>

<p>10. What specifick difference can be produc'd between a Knave, a
Coward, and a Traytor.</p>

<p>Abundance of these Mysteries are Hieroglyphically describ'd in
this ample Collection, and without doubt our great Collection of
Annals, and Historical Observations, particularly the Learned Mr.
<i>Walker</i>, would make great Improvements there.</p>

<p>But to come nearer home, <i>There</i>, to <i>my great
Amasement</i>, I found several new Tracts out of our own Language,
which I could hardly have imagin'd it possible should have reacht
so far.</p>

<p>As first, sundry Transactions of our Royal Society about Winds,
and a valuable Desertation of Dr. <i>B.....</i>'s about Wind in the
Brain.</p>

<p>A Discourse of Poisons, by the Learned Dr. <i>M.....</i> with
<i>Lunar</i> Notes upon it, wherein it appears that Dr.
<i>C....d</i> had more Poison in his Tongue, than all the Adders
the Moon have in their Teeth.</p>

<p><i>Nec Non</i>, or Lawyers <i>Latin</i> turn'd into <i>Lunar
Burlesque</i>. The Hyerogliphick was the <i>Queens Mony tost in a
Blanket</i>, Dedicated to the Attorney General, and five false
<i>Latin</i> Councellors.</p>

<p><i>Mandamus</i>, as it was Acted at <i>Abb...ton</i> Assizes, by
Mr. So....r General, where the Qu..n had her own So...r against her
for a bad Cause, and never a Counsel for her in a good one.</p>

<p>Lunar Reflections, being a List of about 2000 ridiculous Errors
in History, palpable Falsities, and scandalous Omissions in Mr.
<i>Collier</i>'s Geographical Dictionary; with a subsequent Enquiry
by way of Appendix, into which are his own, and which he has
ignorantly deduc'd from ancient Authors.</p>

<p>Assassination and Killing of Kings, prov'd to be a Church of
<i>England</i> Doctrin; humbly Dedicated to the Prince of
<i>Wales</i>, by Mr. <i>Collier</i> and Mr. <i>Snat</i>; wherein
their Absolving Sir <i>John Friend</i> and Sir <i>William
Parkins</i> without Repentance, and while they both own'd and
justify'd the Fact, is Vindicated and Defended.</p>

<p><i>Les Bagatelles</i>, or <i>Brom..ys</i> Travels into
<i>Italy</i>, a choice Book, and by great Accident preserv'd from
the malitious Design of the Author, who diligently Bought up the
whole Impression, for fear they should be seen, as a thing of which
this ungrateful Age was not worthy.</p>

<p><i>Killing no Murther</i>, being an Account of the severe
Justice design'd to be inflicted on the barbarous Murtherers of the
honest Constable at <i>Bow</i>, but unhappily prevented by my Lord
<i>N.....m</i> being turn'd out of his Office.</p>

<p><i>De modo Belli</i>, or an Account of the best Method of making
Conquests and Invasion <i>a la Mode de Port St. Mary</i>, 3 Volumes
in 80. Dedicated to Sir <i>Hen. Bell...s</i>.</p>

<p>King <i>Charles</i> the first prov'd a T...t. By <i>Edward</i>
Earl of <i>Clarendon</i>, 3 Vol. in Fol. Dedicated to the
University of <i>Oxford</i>.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
