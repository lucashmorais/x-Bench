<h1>
Paul's Letter to Titus
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, a servant of God,
and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen
ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> in hope of eternal life,
which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> but in his own time revealed his
word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the
commandment of God our Savior;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> to Titus, my true child according
to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> I left you in Crete for
this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and
appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> if anyone is blameless, the
husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of
loose or unruly behavior.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> For the overseer must be
blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not
given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> but given to hospitality, as a
lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> holding to the faithful word which
is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound
doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> For there are also many unruly
men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
 <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> whose mouths must be
stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought
not, for dishonest gain's sake.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> One of them, a prophet of their
own, said, &quot;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle
gluttons.&quot;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> This
testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be
sound in the faith,  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> not
paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away
from the truth.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> To the
pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving,
nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
 <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> They profess that they
know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient,
and unfit for any good work.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> But say the things
which fit sound doctrine,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> that older men should be
temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in
patience:  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> and that older
women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to
much wine, teachers of that which is good;  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> that they may train the young
women to love their husbands, to love their children,  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> to be sober minded, chaste,
workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that
God's word may not be blasphemed.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Likewise, exhort the younger men
to be sober minded;  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> in all
things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing
integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> and soundness of speech that can't
be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing
to say about us.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Exhort
servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing
in all things; not contradicting;  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> not stealing, but showing all
good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all
things.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For the grace of
God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> instructing us to the intent
that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world;  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> looking for the blessed hope and
appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> who gave himself for us, that he
might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his
own possession, zealous for good works.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Say these things and exhort and
reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Remind them to be in
subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for
every good work,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> to speak
evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility
toward all men.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> For we
were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
 <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> But when the kindness of
God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> not by works of righteousness,
which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through
the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> whom he poured out on us richly,
through Jesus Christ our Savior;  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> that, being justified by his
grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
 <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> This saying is faithful,
and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that
those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These
things are good and profitable to men;  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> but shun foolish questionings,
genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable
and vain.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Avoid a
factious man after a first and second warning;  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> knowing that such a one is
perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> When I send Artemas to
you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have
determined to winter there.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Send Zenas, the lawyer, and
Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.
 <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Let our people also learn
to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
<p> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> All who are with me
greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Titus ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web5610h.htm or web5610h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web5611h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web5610ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>

efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
