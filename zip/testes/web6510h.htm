<h1>
The Letter from Jude
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> <a href="#N1">Jude,</a> a
servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called,
sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Mercy to you and peace and love be
multiplied.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Beloved, while I was
very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I was constrained
to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was
once for all delivered to the saints.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> For there are certain men who
crept in secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this
condemnation: ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into
lasciviousness, and denying our only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Now I desire to remind
you, though you already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people
out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn't believe.
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Angels who didn't keep
their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in
everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
 <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Even as Sodom and
Gomorrah, and the cities around them, having, in the same way as these,
given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh,
are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
 <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Yet in like manner these
also in their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander
celestial beings.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> But
Michael, the archangel, when contending with the devil and arguing about
the body of Moses, dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation,
but said, &quot;May the Lord rebuke you!&quot;  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> But these speak evil of whatever
things they don't know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures
without reason, they are destroyed in these things.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Woe to them! For they went in the
way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and
perished in Korah's rebellion.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> These are hidden rocky reefs in
your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed
themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves
without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> wild waves of the sea, foaming
out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness
has been reserved forever.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> About these also Enoch, the
seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, &quot;Behold, the Lord came with
ten thousands of his holy ones,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> to execute judgment on all, and
to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they
have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him.&quot;  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> These are murmurers and
complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud
things), showing respect of persons to gain advantage.
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> But you, beloved,
remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our
Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> They
said to you that &quot;In the last time there will be mockers, walking
after their own ungodly lusts.&quot;  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> These are they who cause
divisions, and are sensual, not having the Spirit.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> But you, beloved, keep building
up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Keep yourselves in the love of
God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
 <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> On some have compassion,
making a distinction,  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> and
some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the
clothing stained by the flesh.
<p> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Now to him who is able
to keep <a href="#N2">them</a> from stumbling, and to present you
faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> to God our Savior, who alone is
wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Jude ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web6510h.htm or web6510h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web6511h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web6510ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
