<br>
 PORTRAITS OF GOLDSMITH.</center>

<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">P<small>ORTRAITS</small> of Goldsmith are not
numerous; and the best known are those of Reynolds and H. W.
Bunbury. That by Sir Joshua was painted in 1766-70, and exhibited
in the Royal Academy (No. 151) from April 24th to May 28th in the
latter year. It represents the poet in a plain white collar, furred
mantle open at the neck, and holding a book in his right hand. Its
general characteristics are given at p. xxviii of the
'Introduction.' It was scraped in mezzotint in 1770 by Reynolds's
Italian pupil, Giuseppe, or Joseph Marchi; and it is dated 1st
December.* Bunbury's portrait first appeared, after Goldsmith's
death, as a frontispiece to the <cite>Haunch of Venison</cite>; and
it was etched in facsimile by James Bretherton. The plate is dated
May 24, 1776. In his loyal but despotic <cite>Life of
Goldsmith</cite> (Bk. iv, ch. 6), Mr. John Forster reproduces these
portraits side by side; in order, he professes, to show 'the
distinction between truth and a caricature of it.' Bunbury, it may
be, was primarily a caricaturist, and possibly looked at most
things from a more or less grotesque point of view; but this
sketch&mdash;it should be observed&mdash;was meant for a likeness,
and we have the express testimony of one who, if she was Bunbury's
sister-in-law, was also Goldsmith's friend, that it rendered
Goldsmith accurately. It 'gives the head with admirable
fidelity'&mdash;says the 'Jessamy Bride' (afterwards Mrs.
Gwyn)&mdash;'as he actually lived among us; nothing can exceed its
truth' (Prior's <cite>Life</cite>, 1837, ii. 380). In other words,
it delineates Goldsmith as his contemporaries saw him, with
bulbous</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*This was the print to which Goldsmith
referred in a well-known anecdote. Speaking to his old Peckham
pupil, Samuel Bishop, whom, after many years, he met accidentally
in London, he asked him eagerly whether he had got an engraving of
the new portrait, and finding he had not, 'said with some emotion,
"if your picture had been published, I should not have suffered an
hour to elapse without procuring it."' But he was speedily
'appeased by apologies.' (Prior's <cite>Life</cite>, 1837, i. 219-
20.)</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">forehead, indecisive chin, and long protruding
upper lip,&mdash;awkward, insignificant, ill at
ease,&mdash;restlessly burning 'to get in and shine.' It enables us
moreover to understand how people who knew nothing of his better
and more lovable qualities, could speak of him as an 'inspired
idiot,' as 'silly Dr. Goldsmith,' as 'talking like poor Poll.' It
is, in short, his external, objective presentment. The picture by
Sir Joshua, on the contrary, is almost wholly subjective. Draped
judiciously in a popular studio costume, which is not that of the
sitter's day, it reveals to us the author of <cite>The Deserted
Village</cite> as Reynolds conceived him to be at his best,
serious, dignified, introspective, with his physical defects partly
extenuated by art, partly over-mastered by his intellectual power.
To quote the 'Jessamy Bride' once more&mdash;it is 'a fine poetical
head for the admiration of posterity, but as it is divested of his
wig and with the shirt collar open, it was not the man as seen in
daily life' (<i>Ib</i>. ii. 380). Had Goldsmith lived in our era of
photography, photography would doubtless have given us something
which would have been neither the one nor the other, but more like
Bunbury than Reynolds. Yet we may be grateful for both. For
Bunbury's sketch and Reynolds's portrait are alike indispensable to
the true comprehension of Goldsmith's curiously dual
personality.*</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The portrait by Reynolds, above referred to, was
painted for the Thrale Gallery at Streatham, on the dispersion of
which, in May, 1816, it was bought for the Duke of Bedford for
&pound;133 7s. It is now at Woburn Abbey (Cat. No. 254). At Knole,
Lord Sackville possesses another version (Cat. No. 239), which was
purchased in 1773 by the Countess Delawarr, and was shown at South
Kensington in 1867. Here the dress is a black coat and a brown
mantle with fur. The present owner exhibited it at the Guelph
Exhibition of 1891. A third version, now in the Irish National
Gallery, once belonged to Goldsmith himself, and then to his
brother-in- law, Daniel Hodson. Finally there is a copy, by a pupil
of Reynolds, in the National Portrait Gallery, to which</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*There is in existence another undated
etching by Bretherton after Bunbury on a larger scale, which comes
much nearer to Reynolds; and it is of course possible, though not
in our opinion probable, that Mrs. Gwyn may have referred to this.
But Forster selected the other for his comparison; it is prefixed
to the <cite>Haunch of Venison</cite>; it is certainly the better
known; and (as we believe) cannot ever have been intended for a
caricature.</small></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">it was bequeathed in 1890 by Dr. Leifchild,
having formerly been the property of Caleb Whitefoord. Caleb
Whitefoord also had an 'admirable miniature' by Reynolds, which
belongs to the Rev. Benjamin Whitefoord, Hon. Canon of Salisbury
(<cite>Whitefoord Papers</cite>, 1898, p. xxvii). A small circular
print, based upon Reynolds, and etched by James Basire, figures on
the title-page of <cite>Retaliation</cite>. Some of the plates are
dated April 18, 1774.* The National Portrait Gallery has also a
silhouette, attributed to Ozias Humphry, R.A., which was presented
in 1883 by Sir Theodore Martin, K.C.B. Then there is the portrait
by Hogarth shown at South Kensington in 1867 by the late Mr.
Studley Martin of Liverpool. It depicts the poet writing at a round
table in a black cap, claret- coloured coat and ruffles. Of this
there is a wood-cut in the later editions of Forster's <cite>
Life</cite> (Bk. iii, ch. 14). The same exhibition of 1867
contained a portrait of Goldsmith in a brown coat and red
waistcoat, 'as a young man.' It was said to be extremely like him
in face, and was attributed to Gainsborough. In Evans's edition of
the <cite>Poetical and Dramatic Works</cite> is another portrait
engraved by Cook, said, on some copies, to be 'from an original
drawing'; and there is in the Print Room at the British Museum yet
another portrait still, engraved by William Ridley 'from a painting
in the possession of the Rev. Mr. Williams,' no doubt Goldsmith's
friend, the Rev. David Williams, founder of the Royal Literary
Fund. One of these last may have been the work to which the poet
refers in a letter to his brother Maurice in January, 1770. 'I have
sent my cousin Jenny [Jane Contarine] a miniature picture of myself
. . . The face you well know, is ugly enough, but it is finely
painted' (<cite>Misc. Works</cite>, 1801, p. 88).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In front of Dublin University is a bronze statue
of Goldsmith by J. H. Foley, R.A., erected in 1864.&dagger; Of this
there is a good engraving by G. Stodart. On the memorial in
Westminster Abbey erected in 1776 is a medallion by Joseph
Nollekens.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*There is also a sketch by Reynolds (?)
at the British Museum.<br>
&dagger;Goldsmith's traditional ill-luck pursued him after death.
During some public procession in front of Trinity College, a number
of undergraduates climbed on the statue, with the result that the
thin metal of the poet's head was flattened or crushed in,
requiring for its readjustment very skilful restorative treatment.
The Editor is indebted for this item of information to the kindness
of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, who was present at the subsequent
operation.</small></p>

<br>
 DESCRIPTIONS OF NEWELL'S<br>
VIEWS OF LISSOY, ETC.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1811, the Rev. R. H. Newell, B.D. and Fellow
of St. John's College, Cambridge, issued an edition of the <cite>
Poetical Works</cite> of Goldsmith. The distinctive feature of this
lay in the fact that it was illustrated by a number of aquatints
'by Mr. Alkin' (i.e. Samuel Alken), after drawings made by Newell
in 1806-9, and was accompanied by a series of 'Remarks, attempting
to ascertain, chiefly from local observation, the actual scene of
<cite>The Deserted Village</cite>.' Some quotations from these
'Remarks' have already been made in the foregoing notes; but as
copies of six of the drawings are given in this volume, it may be
well, in each case, to reproduce Newell's 'descriptions.'</p>

<br>
<center>LISHOY, OR LISSOY MILL.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The west end of it, as seen from a field near
the road; to the north the country slopes away in coarsely
cultivated enclosures, and the distance eastward is bounded by the
Longford hills. The stream ran from the south side of the mill
(where it is still of some width though nearly choked up), and fell
over the once busy wheel, into a deep channel, now overgrown with
weeds. Neglect and poverty appear all around. The farm house and
barn-like buildings, which fill up the sketch, seem to have no
circumstances of interest attached to them (p. 83).</p>

<center>KILKENNY WEST CHURCH.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This south-west view was taken from the road,
which passes by the church, towards Lishoy, and overlooks the
adjacent country to the west. The church appears neat, its exterior
having been lately repaired. The tree added to the foreground is
the only liberty taken with the subject (p. 83).</p>

<br>
<center>HAWTHORN TREE.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">An east view of the tree, as it stood in August,
1806. The Athlone road occupies the centre of the sketch, winding
round</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">the stone wall to the right, into the village,
and to the left leading toward the church. The cottage and tree
opposite the hawthorn, adjoin the present public-house; the avenue
before the parsonage tops the distant eminence (p. 84).</p>

<br>
 

<center>SOUTH VIEW FROM GOLDSMITH'S MOUNT.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In this sketch 'the decent church,' at the top
of the hill in the distance, is an important object, from its exact
correspondence with the situation given it in the poem. Half-way up
stands the solitary ruin of Lord Dillon's castle. The hill in
shadow, on the left, is above the village, and is supposed to be
alluded to in the line&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        Up yonder hill the distant murmur rose.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A flat of bogland extends from the narrow lake
in the centre to the mount on the right of the foreground (p.
84).</p>

<br>
 

<center>THE PARSONAGE.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A south view from the Athlone road, which runs
parallel with the stone wall, and nearly east and west: the gateway
is that mentioned in Goldsmith's letter,* the mount being directly
opposite, in a field contiguous with the road.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The ruinous stone wall in this and three other
sketches, which is a frequent sort of fence in the neighbourhood,
gives a characteristic propriety to the line (48)</p>

<pre>
        And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall.

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cottage is situated, as the poem describes
it, by the road-side, just where it forms a sharp angle by
branching out from the village eastward: at this point a south-
west view was taken (p. 85).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">mind, refer to 1806-9. His enthusiastic
identifications will no doubt be taken by the reader with the
needful grain of salt. Goldsmith probably remembered the hawthorn
bush, the church upon the hill, the watercress gatherer, and some
other familiar objects of the 'seats of his youth.' But distance
added charm to the regretful retrospect; and in the details his
fancy played freely with his memories. It would be unwise, for
example, to infer&mdash;as Mr. Hogan did&mdash;the decorations of
the <cite>Three Pidgeons</cite> at Lissoy from the account of the
inn in the poem. Some twelve years before its publication, when he
was living miserably in Green Arbour Court, Goldsmith had submitted
to his brother Henry a sample of a heroi-comic poem describing a
Grub Street writer in bed in 'a paltry ale-house.' In this 'the
sanded floor,' the 'twelve good rules' and the broken tea-cups all
played their parts as accessories, and even the double-dealing
chest had its prototype in the poet's night- cap, which was 'a cap
by night&mdash;a stocking all the day.' A year or two later he
expanded these lines in the <cite>Citizen of the World</cite>, and
the scene becomes the Red Lion in Drury Lane. From this second
version he adapted, or extended again, the description of the inn
parlour in <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>. It follows therefore,
either that he borrowed for London the details of a house in
Ireland, or that he used for Ireland the details of a house in
London. If, on the other hand, it be contended that those details
were common to both places, then the identification in these
particulars of Auburn with Lissoy falls hopelessly to the
ground.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX C</h3>

<br>
THE EPITHET 'SENTIMENTAL.'</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Goldsmith's use of 'sentimental' in the
'prologue' to <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite> (p. 109, l.
36)&mdash;the only occasion upon which he seems to have employed it
in his <cite>Poems</cite>&mdash;affords an excuse for bringing
together one or two dispersed illustrations of the rise and growth
of this once highly-popular adjective, not as yet</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*What follows is taken from the writer's
'Introduction' to Mr. Edwin Abbey's illustrated edition of <cite>
The Deserted Village</cite>, 1902, p. ix.</small></p>

<br>

<center><a name="page 265"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">reached in the <i>N. E. D.</i> Johnson, who must
often have heard it, ignores it altogether; and in Todd's edition
of his <cite>Dictionary</cite> (1818) it is expressly marked with a
star as one of the modern words which are 'not' to be found in the
Doctor's collection. According to Mr. Sidney Lee's admirable
article in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> on
Sterne, that author is to be regarded as the 'only begetter' of the
epithet. Mr. Lee says that it first occurs in a letter of 1740
written by the future author of <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> to the
Miss Lumley he afterwards married. Here is the precise and
characteristic passage:&mdash;'I gave a thousand pensive,
penetrating looks at the chair thou hadst so often graced, in those
quiet and <i>sentimental</i> repasts&mdash;then laid down my knife
and fork, and took out my handkerchief, and clapped it across my
face, and wept like a child' (Sterne's <cite>Works</cite> by
Saintsbury, 1894, v. 25). Nine years later, however circulated,
'sentimental' has grown 'so much in vogue' that it has reached from
London to the provinces. 'Mrs. Belfour' (Lady Bradshaigh) writing
from Lincolnshire to Richardson says:&mdash;'Pray, Sir, give me
leave to ask you . . . what, in your opinion, is the meaning of the
word <i>sentimental</i>, so much in vogue amongst the polite, both
in town and country? In letters and common conversation, I have
asked several who make use of it, and have generally received for
answer, it is&mdash;it is&mdash;<i>sentimental</i>. Every thing
clever and agreeable is comprehended in that word; but [I] am
convinced a wrong interpretation is given, because it is impossible
every thing clever and agreeable can be so common as this word. I
am frequently astonished to hear such a one is a <i>sentimental</i>
man; we were a <i>sentimental</i> party; I have been taking a <i>
sentimental</i> walk. And that I might be reckoned a little in the
fashion, and, as I thought, show them the proper use of the word,
about six weeks ago, I declared I had just received a <i>
sentimental</i> letter. Having often laughed at the word, and found
fault with the application of it, and this being the first time I
ventured to make use of it, I was loudly congratulated upon the
occasion: but I should be glad to know your interpretation of it'
(Richardson's <cite>Correspondence</cite>, 1804, iv. pp. 282- 3).
The reply of the author of <cite>Clarissa</cite>, which would have
been interesting, is not given; but it is clear that by this date
(1749) 'sentimental' must already have been rather overworked by
'the polite.' Eleven years after this we meet with it in the
Prologue to Colman's</p>

Honeycombe</cite>. 'And then,' he says, commenting upon the fiction
of the period,&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        And then so <i>sentimental</i> is the Stile,
        So chaste, yet so bewitching all the while!
        Plot, and elopement, passion, rape, and rapture,
        The total sum of ev'ry dear&mdash;dear&mdash;Chapter.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With February, 1768, came Sterne's <cite>
Sentimental Journey</cite> upon which Wesley has this
comment:&mdash;'I casually took a volume of what is called, "A
Sentimental Journey through France and Italy." <i>Sentimental</i>!
what is that? It is not English: he might as well say, <i>
Continental</i> [!]. It is not sense. It conveys no determinate
idea; yet one fool makes many. And this nonsensical word (who would
believe it?) is become a fashionable one!' (<cite>Journal</cite>,
February 11, 1772). In 1773, Goldsmith puts it in the 'Dedication'
to <cite>She Stoops</cite>:&mdash;'The undertaking a comedy, not
merely ^sentimental^, was very dangerous;' and Garrick (forgetting
Kelly and <cite>False Delicacy</cite>) uses it more than once in
his 'Prologue' to the same play, e.g.&mdash;'Faces are blocks in
^sentimental^ scenes.' Further examples might easily be multiplied,
for the word, in spite of Johnson, had now come to stay. Two years
subsequently we find Sheridan referring to</p>

<pre>
        The goddess of the woful countenance,
        The <i>sentimental</i> Muse!&mdash;
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">in an occasional 'Prologue' to <cite>The
Rivals</cite>. It must already have passed into the vocabulary of
the learned. Todd gives examples from Shenstone and Langhorne.
Warton has it more than once in his <cite>History of English
Poetry</cite>; and it figures in the <cite>Essays</cite> of
Vicesimus Knox. Thus academically launched, we need no longer
follow its fortunes.</p>

not resemble his manner. Another piece with the title of <cite>The

<h3>APPENDIX E</h3>

<br>
 GOLDSMITH ON POETRY UNDER ANNE AND<br>
GEORGE THE FIRST.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Letter xvi, vol. ii. pp.139-41, of <cite>An
History of England in a Series of Letters from a Nobleman to his
Son</cite>, 1764, Goldsmith gives the following short account of
the state of poetry in the first quarter of the Eighteenth
Century.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">'But, of all the other arts, poetry in this age
was carried to the greatest perfection. The language, for some
ages, had been improving, but now it seemed entirely divested of
its roughness and barbarity. Among the poets of this period we may
place John Philips, author of several poems, but of none more
admired than that humourous one, entitled, <cite>The Splendid
Shilling</cite>; he lived in obscurity, and died just above want.
William Congreve deserves also particular notice; his comedies,
some of which were but coolly received upon their first appearance,
seemed to mend upon repetition; and he is, at present, justly
allowed the foremost in that species of dramatic poesy. His wit is
ever just and brilliant; his sentiments new and lively; and his
elegance equal to his regularity. Next him Vanbrugh is placed,
whose humour seems more natural, and characters more new; but he
owes too many obligations to the French, entirely to pass for an
original; and his total disregard to decency, in a great measure,
impairs his merit. Farquhar is still more lively, and, perhaps more
entertaining than either; his pieces still continue the favourite
performances of the stage, and bear frequent repetition without
satiety; but he often mistakes pertness for wit, and seldom strikes
his characters with proper force or originality. However, he died
very young; and it is remarkable, that he</p>

<br>
<hr>
<center><a name="page 269"><font color="#000000"><i>page
269</i></font></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">continued to improve as he grew older; his last
play, entitled <cite>The Beaux' Strategem</cite>, being the best of
his productions. Addison, both as a poet and prose writer, deserves
the highest regard and imitation. His <cite>Campaign</cite>, and
<cite>Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy</cite>, are masterpieces in
the former, and his <cite>Essays</cite> published in the <cite>
Spectator</cite> are inimitable specimens of the latter. Whatever
he treated of was handled with elegance and precision; and that
virtue which was taught in his writings, was enforced by his
example. Steele was Addison's friend and admirer; his comedies are
perfectly polite, chaste, and genteel; nor were his other works
contemptible; he wrote on several subjects, and yet it is amazing,
in the multiplicity of his pursuits, how he found leisure for the
discussion of any. Ever persecuted by creditors, whom his
profuseness drew upon him, or pursuing impracticable schemes,
suggested by ill-grounded ambition. Dean Swift was the professed
antagonist both of Addison and him. He perceived that there was a
spirit of romance mixed with all the works of the poets who
preceded him; or, in other words, that they had drawn nature on the
most pleasing side. There still therefore was a place left for him,
who, careless of censure, should describe it just as it was, with
all its deformities; he therefore owes much of his fame, not so
much to the greatness of his genius, as to the boldness of it. He
was dry, sarcastic, and severe; and suited his style exactly to the
turn of his thought, being concise and nervous. In this period also
flourished many of subordinate fame. Prior was the first who
adopted the French elegant easy manner of telling a story; but if
what he has borrowed from that nation be taken from him, scarce
anything will be left upon which he can lay any claim to applause
in poetry. Rowe was only outdone by Shakespeare and Otway as a
tragic writer; he has fewer absurdities than either; and is,
perhaps, as pathetic as they; but his flights are not so bold, nor
his characters so strongly marked. Perhaps his coming later than
the rest may have contributed to lessen the esteem he deserves.
Garth had success as a poet; and, for a time, his fame was even
greater than his desert. In his principal work, <cite>The
Dispensary</cite>, his versification is negligent; and his plot is
now become tedious; but whatever he may lose as a poet, it would be
improper to rob him of the merit he deserves for having written the
prose dedication, and preface, to the poem already mentioned; in
which he</p>

<br>
<hr>
<center><a name="page 270"><font color="#000000"><i>page
270</i></font></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">has shown the truest wit, with the most refined
elegance. Parnell, though he has written but one poem, namely,
<cite>The Hermit</cite>, yet has found a place among the English
first rate poets. Gay, likewise, by his <cite>Fables</cite> and
<cite>Pastorals</cite>, has acquired an equal reputation. But of
all who have added to the stock of English Poetry, Pope, perhaps,
deserves the first place. On him, foreigners look as one of the
most successful writers of his time; his versification is the most
harmonious, and his correctness the most remarkable of all our
poets. A noted contemporary of his own calls the English the finest
writers on moral topics, and Pope the noblest moral writer of all
the English. Mr. Pope has somewhere named himself the last English
Muse; and, indeed, since his time, we have seen scarce any
production that can justly lay claim to immortality; he carried the
language to its highest perfection; and those who have attempted
still farther to improve it, instead of ornament, have only caught
finery.'</p>

<h3>APPENDIX F</h3>

<br>
 CRITICISMS FROM GOLDSMITH'S 'BEAUTIES<br>
OF ENGLISH POESY.'</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To <cite>The Beauties of English Poesy</cite>, 2
vols., 1767, Goldsmith prefixed, in each case, 'short introductory
criticisms.' They are, as he says, 'rather designed for boys than
men'; and aim only at being 'obvious and sincere'; but they carry
his views on the subject somewhat farther than the foregoing
account from the <cite>History of England</cite>.</p>

<br>
 

<center>THE RAPE OF THE LOCK.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This seems to be Mr. Pope's most finished
production, and is, perhaps, the most perfect in our language. It
exhibits stronger powers of imagination, more harmony of numbers,
and a greater knowledge of the world, than any other of this poet's
works; and it is probable, if our country were called upon to show
a specimen of their genius to foreigners, this would be the work
here fixed upon.</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page 271"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>THE HERMIT.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem is held in just esteem, the
versification being chaste, and tolerably harmonious, and the story
told with perspicuity and conciseness. It seems to have cost great
labour, both to Mr. Pope and Parnell himself, to bring it to this
perfection.* It may not be amiss to observe that the fable is taken
from one of Dr. Henry More's Dialogues.</p>

<br>
<center>IL PENSEROSO.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">I have heard a very judicious critic say, that
he had an higher idea of Milton's style in poetry, from the two
following poems [<cite>Il Penseroso</cite> and <cite>
l'Allegro</cite>], than from his <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. It is
certain the imagination shown in them is correct and strong. The
introduction to both in irregular measure is borrowed from the
Italian, and hurts an English ear.</p>

<br>
<center>AN ELEGY, WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is a very fine poem, but overloaded with
epithet.&dagger; The heroic measure with alternate rhyme is very
properly adapted to the solemnity of the subject, as it is the
slowest movement that our language admits of. The latter part of
the poem is pathetic and interesting.</p>

<br>
 

<center>LONDON. IN IMITATION OF THE THIRD SATIRE<br>
OF JUVENAL.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem of Mr. Johnson's is the best imitation
of the original that has appeared in our language, being possessed
of all the force and satirical resentment of Juvenal. Imitation
gives us a much truer idea of the ancients than even translation
could do.</p>

<br>
<center>THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. IN IMITATION OF SPENSER.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem is one of those happinesses in which a
poet excels himself, as there is nothing in all Shenstone which in
any way approaches it in merit; and, though I dislike the
imitations of</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*Parnell's <cite>Poems</cite>, 1770,
xxiv.<br>
&dagger;This is a strange complaint to come from Goldsmith, whose
own <cite>Hermit</cite>, as was pointed out to the present Editor
by the late Mr. Kegan Paul, is certainly open to this
impeachment.</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">our old English poets in general, yet, on this
minute subject, the antiquity of the style produces a very
ludicrous solemnity.</p>

<br>
 

<center>COOPER'S HILL.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem, by Denham, though it may have been
exceeded by later attempts in description, yet deserves the highest
applause, as it far surpasses all that went before it: the
concluding part, though a little too much crowded, is very
masterly.</p>

<br>
 

<center>ELOISA TO ABELARD.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The harmony of numbers in this poem is very
fine. It is rather drawn out to too tedious a length, although the
passions vary with great judgement. It may be considered as
superior to anything in the epistolary way; and the many
translations which have been made of it into the modern languages,
are in some measure a proof of this.</p>

<br>
<center>AN EPISTLE FROM MR. PHILIPS [Ambrose Philips]<br>
TO THE EARL OF DORSET.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The opening of this poem is incomparably fine.
The latter part is tedious and trifling.</p>

<br>
 

<center>A LETTER FROM ITALY, TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<br>
CHARLES LORD HALIFAX.<br>
<br>
 In the Year MDCCI.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Few poems have done more honour to English
genius than this. There is in it a strain of political thinking
that was, at that time, new in our poetry. Had the harmony of this
been equal to that of Pope's versification, it would be
incontestably the finest poem in our language; but there is a
dryness in the numbers which greatly lessens the pleasure excited
both by the poet's judgement and imagination.*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>ALEXANDER'S FEAST; OR, THE POWER OF MUSIC.<br>
AN ODE, IN HONOUR OF ST. CECILIA'S DAY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This ode [by Mr. Dryden] has been more
applauded, perhaps, than it has been felt, however, it is a very
fine one, and gives its beauties rather at a third, or fourth, than
at a first perusal.</p>

<br>
<center>ODE FOR MUSIC ON ST. CECILIA'S DAY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This ode [by Mr. Pope] has by many been thought
equal to the former. As it is a repetition of Dryden's manner, it
is so far inferior to him. The whole hint of Orpheus, and many of
the lines, have been taken from an obscure Ode upon Music,
published in Tate's Miscellanies.*</p>

<br>
<center>THE SHEPHERD'S WEEK. IN SIX PASTORALS.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These are Mr. Gay's principal performances. They
were originally intended, I suppose, as a burlesque on those of
[Ambrose] Philips; but, perhaps without designing it, he has hit
the true spirit of pastoral poetry. In fact, he more resembles
Theocritus than any other English pastoral writer whatsoever. There
runs through the whole a strain of rustic pleasantry which should
ever distinguish this species of composition; but how far the
antiquated expressions used here may contribute to the humour, I
will not determine; for my own part, I could wish the simplicity
were preserved, without recurring to such obsolete antiquity for
the manner of expressing it.</p>

<br>
<center>MAC FLECKNOE.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The severity of this satire, and the excellence
of its versification give it a distinguished rank in this species
of composition. At present, an ordinary reader would scarce suppose
that Shadwell, who is here meant by Mac Flecknoe, was worth being
chastised, and that Dryden's descending to such game was like an
eagle's stooping to catch flies.&dagger; The truth however is,
Shadwell, at one time, held divided reputation with this great
poet. Every</p>

following the transient topic, or humour, of the day, supply
talkative ignorance with materials for conversation.</p>

<br>
<center>ON POETRY. A RHAPSODY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here follows one of the best versified poems in
our language, and the most masterly production of its author. The
severity with which Walpole is here treated, was in consequence of
that minister having refused to provide for Swift in England, when
applied to for that purpose in the year 1725 (if I remember right).
The severity of a poet, however, gave Walpole very little
uneasiness. A man whose schemes, like this minister's, seldom
extended beyond the exigency of the year, but little regarded the
contempt of posterity.</p>

<br>
<center>OF THE USE OF RICHES.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem, as Mr. Pope tells us himself, cost
much attention and labour; and, from the easiness that appears in
it, one would be apt to think as much.</p>

<br>
<center>FROM THE DISPENSARY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This sixth canto of the <cite>Dispensary</cite>,
by Dr. Garth, has more merit than the whole preceding part of the
poem, and, as I am told, in the first edition of this work it is
more correct than as here exhibited; but that edition I have not
been able to find. The praises bestowed on this poem are more than
have been given to any other; but our approbation, at present, is
cooler, for it owed part of its fame to party.*</p>

<br>
 

<center>ECLOGUE I.<br>
<br>
S<small>ELIM: OR, THE</small> S<small>HEPHERD'S</small>
M<small>ORAL.</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The following eclogues,&dagger; written by Mr.
Collins, are very pretty: the images, it must be owned, are not
very local; for the pastoral subject could not well admit of it.

subject as yet unattempted amongst us, and I believe, capable of
furnishing a great variety of poetical imagery.</p>

<br>
<center>THE SPLENDID SHILLING.<br>
<br>
B<small>Y</small> M<small>R.</small> J.
P<small>HILIPS.</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is reckoned the best parody of Milton in
our language: it has been an hundred times imitated, without
success. The truth is, the first thing in this way must preclude
all future attempts; for nothing is so easy as to burlesque any
man's manner, when we are once showed the way.</p>

<br>
<center>A PIPE OF TOBACCO:<br>
<br>
 I<small>N</small> I<small>MITATION OF</small> S<small>IX</small>
S<small>EVERAL</small> A<small>UTHORS.</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Hawkins Browne, the author of these, as I am
told, had no good original manner of his own, yet we see how well
he succeeded when he turns an imitator; for the following are
rather imitations than ridiculous parodies.</p>

<br>
<center>A NIGHT-PIECE ON DEATH.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The great fault of this piece, written by Dr.
Parnell, is that it is in eight- syllable lines, very improper for
the solemnity of the subject; otherwise, the poem is natural, and
the reflections just.</p>

<br>
<center>A FAIRY TALE.<br>
<br>
 B<small>Y</small> D<small>R.</small>
P<small>ARNELL.</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Never was the old manner of speaking more
happily applied, or a tale better told, than this.</p>

<br>
<center>PALEMON AND LAVINIA.<br>
[From <cite>The Seasons</cite>.]</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Thomson, though, in general, a verbose and
affected poet, has told this story with unusual simplicity: it is
rather given here for being much esteemed by the public, than by
the editor.</p>

<br>
<center>THE BASTARD.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Almost all things written from the heart, as
this certainly was, have some merit. The poet here describes
sorrows and misfortunes which were by no means imaginary; and,
thus, there</p>

<br>
<hr>
<center><a name="page 276"><font color="#000000"><i>page
276</i></font></a></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">runs a truth of thinking through this poem,
without which it would be of little value, as Savage is, in other
respects, but an indifferent poet.</p>

<br>
<center>THE POET AND HIS PATRON.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Mo[o]re was a poet that never had justice
done him while living; there are few of the moderns have a more
correct taste, or a more pleasing manner of expressing their
thoughts. It was upon these fables [Nos. v, vi, and xvi of the
<cite>Fables for the Ladies</cite>] he chiefly founded his
reputation; yet they are, by no means, his best production.</p>

<br>
<center>AN EPISTLE TO A LADY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This little poem, by Mr. Nugent [afterwards Lord
Clare] is very pleasing. The easiness of the poetry, and the
justice of the thoughts, constitute its principal beauty.</p>

<br>
<center>HANS CARVEL.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This bagatelle, for which, by the by, Mr. Prior
has got his greatest reputation, was a tale told in all the old
Italian collections of jests, and borrowed from thence by Fontaine.
It had been translated once or twice before into English, yet was
never regarded till it fell into the hands of Mr. Prior. A strong
instance how everything is improved in the hands of a man of
genius.</p>

<br>
<center>BAUCIS AND PHILEMON.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem [by Swift] is very fine; and though in
the same strain with the preceding [Prior's <cite>Ladle</cite>] is
yet superior.</p>

<br>
<center>TO THE EARL OF WARWICK, ON THE DEATH<br>
OF MR. ADDISON.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This elegy (by Mr. Ticknell) is one of the
finest in our language; there is so little new that can be said
upon the death of a friend, after the complaints of Ovid and the
Latin Italians, in this way, that one is surprised to see so much
novelty in this to strike us, and so much interest to affect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>COLIN AND LUCY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Through all Tickell's works there is a strain of
ballad-thinking, if I may so express it; and, in this professed
ballad, he seems to have surpassed himself. It is, perhaps, the
best in our language in this way.</p>

<br>
<center>THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND.<br>
<br>
 W<small>RITTEN IN THE</small> Y<small>EAR</small>
MDCCXLVI.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This ode, by Dr. Smollett, does rather more
honour to the author's feelings than his taste. The mechanical
part, with regard to numbers and language, is not so perfect as so
short a work as this requires; but the pathetic it contains,
particularly in the last stanza but one, is exquisitely fine.</p>

<br>
<center>ON THE DEATH OF THE LORD PROTECTOR.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Our poetry was not quite harmonized in Waller's
time; so that this, which would be now looked upon as a slovenly
sort of versification, was, with respect to the times in which it
was written, almost a prodigy of harmony. A modern reader will
chiefly be struck with the strength of thinking, and the turn of
the compliments bestowed upon the usurper. Everybody has heard the
answer our poet made Charles II; who asked him how his poem upon
Cromwell came to be finer than his panegyric upon himself. 'Your
majesty,' replies Waller, 'knows, that poets always succeed best in
fiction.'</p>

<br>
<center>THE STORY OF PHOEBUS AND DAPHNE APPLIED.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The French claim this [by Mr. Waller] as
belonging to them. To whomsoever it belongs the thought is finely
turned.</p>

<br>
<center>NIGHT THOUGHTS.<br>
<br>
 B<small>Y</small> D<small>R.</small>
Y<small>OUNG.</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These seem to be the best of the collection;
from whence only the two first are taken. They are spoken of
differently, either with exaggerated applause or contempt, as the
reader's disposition is either turned to mirth or melancholy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>SATIRE I.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Young's Satires were in higher reputation when
published, than they stand in at present. He seems fonder of
dazzling than pleasing; of raising our admiration for his wit, than
our dislike of the follies he ridicules.</p>

<br>
<center>A PASTORAL BALLAD.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These ballads of Mr. Shenstone are chiefly
commended for the natural simplicity of the thoughts and the
harmony of the versification. However, they are not excellent in
either.</p>

<br>
<center>PHOEBE. A PASTORAL.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This, by Dr. Byrom, is a better effort than the
preceding [a ballad by Shenstone].</p>

<br>
<center>A SONG.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This ['Despairing beside a clear stream'] by Mr.
Rowe, is better than anything of the kind in our language.</p>

<br>
<center>AN ESSAY ON POETRY.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This work, by the Duke of Buckingham, is
enrolled among our great English productions. The precepts are
sensible, the poetry not indifferent, but it has been praised more
than it deserves.</p>

<br>
<center>CADENUS AND VANESSA.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is thought one of Dr. Swift's correctest
pieces; its chief merit, indeed, is the elegant ease with which a
story, but ill-conceived in itself, is told.</p>

<br>
<center>ALMA: OR, THE PROGRESS OF THE MIND.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What Prior meant by this poem I can't
understand; by the Greek motto to it one would think it was either
to laugh at the subject or the reader. There are some parts of it
very fine; and let them save the badness of the rest.</p>
