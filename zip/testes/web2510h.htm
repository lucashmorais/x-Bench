<h1>
Lamentations
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> How the city sits
solitary, that was full of people!
<dl>
<dt>She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations!
<dt>She who was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> She weeps sore in the
night, and her tears are on her cheeks;
<dt>among all her lovers she has none to comfort her:
<dt>All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her
enemies.
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Judah is gone into
captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude;
<dt>she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest:
<dt>all her persecutors overtook her within the straits.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> The ways of Zion do
mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly;
<dt>all her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:
<dt>her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Her adversaries are
become the head, her enemies prosper;
<dt>for Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
<dt>her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> From the daughter of
Zion all her majesty is departed:
<dt>her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,
<dt>they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Jerusalem remembers in
the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things
that were from the days of old:
<dt>when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help
her,
<dt>The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Jerusalem has
grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing;
<dt>all who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:
<dt>yes, she sighs, and turns backward.
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Her filthiness was in
her skirts; she didn't remember her latter end;
<dt>therefore is she come down wonderfully; she has no comforter:
<dt>see, Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.
<dt> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> The adversary has
spread out his hand on all her pleasant things:
<dt>for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,
<dt>concerning whom you did command that they should not enter into your
assembly.
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> All her people sigh,
they seek bread;
<dt>they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul:
<dt>look, Yahweh, and see; for I am become abject.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Is it nothing to you,
all you who pass by?
<dt>Look, and see if there be any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought
on me,
<dt>With which Yahweh has afflicted <I>me</I> in the day of his fierce
anger.
<dt> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> From on high has he
sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them;
<dt>He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back:
<dt>He has made me desolate and faint all the day.
<dt> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> The yoke of my
transgressions is bound by his hand;
<dt>They are knit together, they are come up on my neck; he has made my
strength to fail:
<dt>The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able
to stand.
<dt> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> The Lord has set at
nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me;
<dt>He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:
<dt>The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.
<dt> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> For these things I
weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water;
<dt>Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me:
<dt>My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.
<dt> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Zion spreads forth
her hands; there is none to comfort her;
<dt>Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are around him
should be his adversaries:
<dt>Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.
<dt> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Yahweh is righteous;
for I have rebelled against his commandment:
<dt>Please hear all you peoples, and see my sorrow:
<dt>My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
<dt> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> I called for my
lovers, <I>but</I> they deceived me:
<dt>My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,
<dt>While they sought them food to refresh their souls.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> See, Yahweh; for I am
in distress; my heart is troubled;
<dt>My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:
<dt>Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.
<dt> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> They have heard that
I sigh; there is none to comfort me;
<dt>All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have
done it:
<dt>You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, and they shall be
like me.
<dt> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Let all their
wickedness come before you;
<dt>Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions:
<dt>For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl>  <dt><a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> How has the Lord
covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!
<dt>He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel,
<dt>And hasn't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The Lord has swallowed
up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied:
<dt>He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of
Judah;
<dt>He has brought them down to the ground; he has profaned the kingdom
and its princes.
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> He has cut off in
fierce anger all the horn of Israel;
<dt>He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:
<dt>He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours all around.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> He has bent his bow
like an enemy, he has stood with his right hand as an adversary,
<dt>Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye:
<dt>In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like
fire.
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> The Lord is become as
an enemy, he has swallowed up Israel;
<dt>He has swallowed up all her palaces, he has destroyed his strongholds;
<dt>He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> He has violently taken
away his tent, as if it were of a garden; he has destroyed his place of
assembly:
<dt>Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
<dt>Has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> The Lord has cast off
his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary;
<dt>He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:
<dt>They have made a noise in the house of Yahweh, as in the day of a
solemn assembly.
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Yahweh has purposed to
destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;
<dt>He has stretched out the line, he has not withdrawn his hand from
destroying;
<dt>He has made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Her gates are sunk
into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars:
<dt>Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;
<dt>Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> The elders of the
daughter of Zion sit on the ground, they keep silence;
<dt>They have cast up dust on their heads; they have girded themselves
with sackcloth:
<dt>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> My eyes do fail with
tears, my heart is troubled;
<dt>My liver is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the
daughter of my people,
<dt>Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the
city.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> They tell their
mothers, Where is grain and wine?
<dt>When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
<dt>When their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> What shall I testify
to you? what shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?
<dt>What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter
of Zion?
<dt>For your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?
<dt> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Your prophets have
seen for you false and foolish visions;
<dt>They have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captivity,
<dt>But have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment.
<dt> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> All that pass by clap
their hands at you;
<dt>They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,
<I>saying</I>,
<dt>Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of
the whole earth?
<dt> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> All your enemies have
opened their mouth wide against you;
<dt>They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;
<dt>Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have
seen it.
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Yahweh has done that
which he purposed; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days
of old;
<dt>He has thrown down, and has not pitied:
<dt>He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; he has exalted the horn
of your adversaries.
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Their heart cried to
the Lord:
<dt>wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and
night;
<dt>Give yourself no respite; don't let the apple of your eye cease.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Arise, cry out in the
night, at the beginning of the watches;
<dt>Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord:
<dt>Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,
that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Look, Yahweh, and see
to whom you have done thus!
<dt>Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the
hands?
<dt>Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the
Lord?
<dt> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> The youth and the old
man lie on the ground in the streets;
<dt>My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:
<dt>You have killed them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered,
<I>and</I> not pitied.
<dt> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> You have called, as
in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side;
<dt>There was none that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh's anger:
<dt>Those that I have dandled and brought up has my enemy consumed.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> I am the man that has
seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> He has led me and
caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Surely against me he
turns his hand again and again all the day.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> My flesh and my skin
has he made old; he has broken my bones.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> He has built against
me, and surrounded me with gall and travail.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> He has made me to
dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> He has walled me
about, that I can't go forth; he has made my chain heavy.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Yes, when I cry, and
call for help, he shuts out my prayer.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> He has walled up my
ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> He is to me as a bear
lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> He has turned aside
my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> He has bent his bow,
and set me as a mark for the arrow.
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> He has caused the
shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> I am become a
derision to all my people, and their song all the day. 
<dt> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> He has filled me with
bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> He has also broken my
teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> You have removed my
soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.
<dt> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> I said, My strength
is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Remember my
affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
<dt> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> My soul still
remembers them, and is bowed down within me.
<dt> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> This I recall to my
mind; therefore have I hope.
<dt> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> <I>It is of</I>
Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his
compassion doesn't fail.
<dt> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> They are new every
morning; great is your faithfulness.
<dt> <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> Yahweh is my portion,
says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
<dt> <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Yahweh is good to
those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
<dt> <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> It is good that a man
should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> It is good for a man
that he bear the yoke in his youth.
<dt> <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> Let him sit alone and
keep silence, because he has laid it on him.
<dt> <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> Let him put his mouth
in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
<dt> <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> Let him give his
cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach.
<dt> <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> For the Lord will not
cast off forever.
<dt> <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> For though he cause
grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his
loving kindnesses.
<dt> <a name="C3V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:33</font></a> For he does not
afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
<dt> <a name="C3V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:34</font></a> To crush under foot
all the prisoners of the earth,
<dt> <a name="C3V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:35</font></a> To turn aside the
right of a man before the face of the Most High,
<dt> <a name="C3V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:36</font></a> To subvert a man in
his cause, the Lord doesn't approve.
<dt> <a name="C3V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:37</font></a> Who is he who says,
and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn't command it?
<dt> <a name="C3V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:38</font></a> Doesn't evil and good
come out of the mouth of the Most High?
<dt> <a name="C3V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:39</font></a> Why does a living man
complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:40</font></a> Let us search and try
our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C3V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:41</font></a> Let us lift up our
heart with our hands to God in the heavens.
<dt> <a name="C3V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:42</font></a> We have transgressed
and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.
<dt> <a name="C3V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:43</font></a> You have covered with
anger and pursued us; you have killed, you have not pitied.
<dt> <a name="C3V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:44</font></a> You have covered
yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
<dt> <a name="C3V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:45</font></a> You have made us an
off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
<dt> <a name="C3V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:46</font></a> All our enemies have
opened their mouth wide against us.
<dt> <a name="C3V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:47</font></a> Fear and the pit are
come on us, devastation and destruction.
<dt> <a name="C3V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:48</font></a> My eye runs down with
streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<dt> <a name="C3V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:49</font></a> My eye pours down,
and doesn't cease, without any intermission,
<dt> <a name="C3V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:50</font></a> Until Yahweh look
down, and see from heaven.
<dt> <a name="C3V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:51</font></a> My eye affects my
soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
<dt> <a name="C3V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:52</font></a> They have chased me
sore like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.
<dt> <a name="C3V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:53</font></a> They have cut off my
life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.
<dt> <a name="C3V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:54</font></a> Waters flowed over my
head; I said, I am cut off.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:55</font></a> I called on your
name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.
<dt> <a name="C3V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:56</font></a> You heard my voice;
don't hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.
<dt> <a name="C3V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:57</font></a> You drew near in the
day that I called on you; you said, Don't be afraid.
<dt> <a name="C3V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:58</font></a> Lord, you have
pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.
<dt> <a name="C3V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:59</font></a> Yahweh, you have seen
my wrong; judge you my cause.
<dt> <a name="C3V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:60</font></a> You have seen all
their vengeance and all their devices against me.
<dt> <a name="C3V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:61</font></a> You have heard their
reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices against me,
<dt> <a name="C3V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:62</font></a> The lips of those
that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
<dt> <a name="C3V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:63</font></a> See you their sitting
down, and their rising up; I am their song.
<dt> <a name="C3V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:64</font></a> You will render to
them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.
<dt> <a name="C3V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:65</font></a> You will give them
hardness of heart, your curse to them.
<dt> <a name="C3V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:66</font></a> You will pursue them
in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.

<dt>The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> The precious sons of
Zion, comparable to fine gold,
<dt>How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of
the potter!
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Even the jackals draw
out the breast, they give suck to their young ones:
<dt>The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the
wilderness.
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> The tongue of the
sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst:
<dt>The young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.
<dt> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Those who did feed
delicately are desolate in the streets:
<dt>Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
<dt> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> For the iniquity of
the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,
<dt>That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid on her.
<dt> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Her nobles were purer
than snow, they were whiter than milk;
<dt>They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of
sapphire.
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Their visage is
blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:
<dt>Their skin cleaves to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a
stick.
<dt> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Those who are killed
with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;
<dt>For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the
field.
<dt> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> The hands of the
pitiful women have boiled their own children;
<dt>They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<dt> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Yahweh has
accomplished his wrath, he has poured out his fierce anger;
<dt>He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations.
<dt> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> The kings of the
earth didn't believe, neither all the inhabitants of the world,
<dt>That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of
Jerusalem.
<dt> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> <I>It is</I> because
of the sins of her prophets, <I>and</I> the iniquities of her priests,
<dt>That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
<dt> <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> They wander as blind
men in the streets, they are polluted with blood,
<dt>So that men can't touch their garments.
<dt> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Depart you, they
cried to them, Unclean! depart, depart, don't touch!
<dt>When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They
shall no more sojourn <I>here</I>.
<dt> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> The anger of Yahweh
has scattered them; he will no more regard them:
<dt>They didn't respect the persons of the priests, they didn't favor the
elders.
<dt> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Our eyes do yet fail
<I>in looking</I> for our vain help:
<dt>In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
<dt> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> They hunt our steps,
so that we can't go in our streets:
<dt>Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
<dt> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Our pursuers were
swifter than the eagles of the sky:
<dt>They chased us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness.
<dt> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> The breath of our
nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken in their pits;
<dt>Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Rejoice and be glad,
daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz:
<dt>The cup shall pass through to you also; you shall be drunken, and
shall make yourself naked.
<dt> <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> The punishment of
your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you
away into captivity:
<dt>He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom; he will uncover your
sins.

<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Remember, Yahweh, what
has come on us:
<dt>Look, and see our reproach.
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Our inheritance is
turned to strangers,
<dt>Our houses to aliens.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> We are orphans and
fatherless;
<dt>Our mothers are as widows.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> We have drunken our
water for money;
<dt>Our wood is sold to us.
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Our pursuers are on
our necks:
<dt>We are weary, and have no rest.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> We have given the hand
to the Egyptians,
<dt>To the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Our fathers sinned,
and are no more;
<dt>We have borne their iniquities.
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Servants rule over us:
<dt>There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> We get our bread at
the peril of our lives,
<dt>Because of the sword of the wilderness.
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Our skin is black
like an oven,
<dt>Because of the burning heat of famine.
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> They ravished the
women in Zion,
<dt>The virgins in the cities of Judah.
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Princes were hanged
up by their hand:
<dt>The faces of elders were not honored.
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> The young men bare
the mill;
<dt>The children stumbled under the wood.
<dt> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> The elders have
ceased from the gate,
<dt>The young men from their music.
<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> The joy of our heart
is ceased;
<dt>Our dance is turned into mourning.
<dt> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> The crown is fallen
from our head:
<dt>Woe to us! for we have sinned.
<dt> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> For this our heart is
faint;
<dt>For these things our eyes are dim;
<dt> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> For the mountain of
Zion, which is desolate:
<dt>The foxes walk on it.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> You, Yahweh, abide
forever;
<dt>Your throne is from generation to generation.
<dt> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Why do you forget us
forever,
<dt><I>And</I> forsake us so long time?
<dt> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> Turn you us to you,
Yahweh, and we shall be turned;
<dt>Renew our days as of old.
<dt> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> But you have utterly
rejected us;
<dt>You are very angry against us.

<p>This file should be named web2510h.htm or web2510h.zip<br>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>
