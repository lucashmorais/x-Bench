<h1>
Habakkuk
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The oracle which Habakkuk
the prophet saw.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Yahweh,
how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you
&quot;Violence!&quot; and will you not save?  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Why do you show me iniquity, and
look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is
strife, and contention rises up.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Therefore the law is paralyzed,
and justice never goes forth; for the wicked surround the righteous;
therefore justice goes forth perverted.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> &quot;Look among the
nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your
days, which you will not believe though it is told you.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> For, behold, I raise up the
Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of
the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> They are feared and dreaded. Their
judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Their horses also are swifter than
leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen
press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle
that hurries to devour.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> All of them come for violence.
Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Yes, he scoffs at kings, and
princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he
builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Then he sweeps by like the wind,
and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Aren't you from
everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Yahweh, you have
appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish.
 <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> You who have purer eyes
than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate
those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up
the man who is more righteous than he,  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> and make men like the fish of the
sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> He takes up all of them with the
hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet.
Therefore he rejoices and is glad.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Therefore he sacrifices to his
net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is
luxurious, and his food is good.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Will he therefore continually
empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> I will stand at my
watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he
will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
<p> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Yahweh answered me,
&quot;Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may
read it.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> For the vision is
yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won't prove
false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It
won't delay.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Behold, his
soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live
by his faith.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Yes,
moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn't stay at home, who
enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like death, and can't be
satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all
peoples.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Won't all these
take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and
say, 'Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches
himself by extortion! How long?'  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Won't your debtors rise up
suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their
victim?  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Because you have
plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you,
because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city
and to all who dwell in it.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Woe to him who gets an evil gain
for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
from the hand of evil!  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> You have devised shame to your
house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.
 <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For the stone will cry
out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Woe to him who builds a town with
blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Behold, isn't it of Yahweh of
Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary
themselves for vanity?  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> For the earth will be filled with
the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> &quot;Woe to him who
gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are
drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> You are filled with shame, and
not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh's right
hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> For the violence done to Lebanon
will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them
afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to
every city and to those who dwell in them.
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> &quot;What value does
the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image,
even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to
make mute idols?  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Woe to
him who says to the wood, 'Awake!' or to the mute stone, 'Arise!' Shall
this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no
breath at all in its midst.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> But Yahweh is in his holy temple.
Let all the earth be silent before him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> A prayer of Habakkuk,
the prophet, set to victorious music.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Yahweh, I have heard
of your fame.
<dd>I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh.
<dt>Renew your work in the midst of the years.
<dd>In the midst of the years make it known.
<dd>In wrath, you remember mercy.
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> God came from Teman,
<dd>the Holy One from Mount Paran.
<dt>Selah.
<dt>
<dt>His glory covered the heavens,
<dd>and his praise filled the earth.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> His splendor is like
the sunrise.
<dd>Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Plague went before him,
<dd>and pestilence followed his feet.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> He stood, and shook
the earth.
<dd>He looked, and made the nations tremble.
<dd>The ancient mountains were crumbled.
<dd>The age-old hills collapsed.
<dd>His ways are eternal.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> I saw the tents of
Cushan in affliction.
<dd>The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Was Yahweh displeased
with the rivers?
<dd>Was your anger against the rivers,
<dd>or your wrath against the sea,
<dd>that you rode on your horses,
<dd>on your chariots of salvation?
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> You uncovered your bow.
<dd>You called for your sworn arrows.
<dt>Selah.
<dt>You split the earth with rivers.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> The mountains saw
you, and were afraid.
<dd>The storm of waters passed by.
<dd>The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> The sun and moon
stood still in the sky,
<dd>at the light of your arrows as they went,
<dd>at the shining of your glittering spear.
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> You marched through
the land in wrath.
<dd>You threshed the nations in anger.
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> You went forth for
the salvation of your people,
<dd>for the salvation of your anointed.
<dt>You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.
<dd>You stripped them head to foot.
<dt>Selah.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> You pierced the heads
of his warriors with their own spears.
<dd>They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,
<dd>gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.
<dt> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> You trampled the sea
with your horses,
<dd>churning mighty waters.
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> I heard, and my body
trembled.
<dd>My lips quivered at the voice.
<dt>Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,
<dd>because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
<dd>for the coming up of the people who invade us.
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> For though the fig
tree doesn't flourish,
<dd>nor fruit be in the vines;
<dd>the labor of the olive fails,
<dd>the fields yield no food;
<dd>the flocks are cut off from the fold,
<dd>and there is no herd in the stalls:
<dt> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> yet I will rejoice in
Yahweh.
<dd>I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!
<dt> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Yahweh, the Lord, is
my strength.
<dd>He makes my feet like deer's feet,
<dd>and enables me to go in high places.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Habakkuk ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web3510h.htm or web3510h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web3511h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web3510ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>
