<h1>
The Good News According to John
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> The same was in the beginning with
God.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> All things were made
through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> In him was life, and the life was
the light of men.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> The
light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't <a
href="#N1">overcome</a> it.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> There came a man, sent from God,
whose name was John.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> The
same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all
might believe through him.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> He was not the light, but was sent
that he might testify about the light.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> The true light that enlightens
everyone was coming into the world.
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world didn't recognize him.
 <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> He came to his own, and
those who were his own didn't receive him.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> But as many as received him, to
them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in
his name:  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> who were born
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> The Word became
flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and
only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> John testified about him. He
cried out, saying, &quot;This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after
me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'&quot;  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> From his fullness we all received
grace upon grace.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> For the
law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
 <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> No one has seen God at
any time. The one and only <a href="#N2">Son,</a> who is in the bosom of
the Father, he has declared him.
<p> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> This is John's
testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> He confessed, and
didn't deny, but he confessed, &quot;I am not the Christ.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> They asked him,
&quot;What then? Are you Elijah?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am not.&quot;
<p>&quot;Are you the prophet?&quot;
<p>He answered, &quot;No.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent
us. What do you say about yourself?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> He said, &quot;I am
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the
Lord,'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
as Isaiah the prophet said.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> The ones who had been
sent were from the Pharisees.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> They asked him, &quot;Why then do
you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> John answered them,
&quot;I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know.
 <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> He is the one who comes
after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to
loosen.&quot;  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> These
things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<p> <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> The next day, he saw
Jesus coming to him, and said, &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes
away the sin of the world!  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> This is he of whom I said, 'After
me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> I didn't know him, but for this
reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to
Israel.&quot;  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> John
testified, saying, &quot;I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out
of heaven, and it remained on him.  <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> I didn't recognize him, but he
who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see
the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes
in the Holy Spirit.'  <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> I
have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> Again, the next day,
John was standing with two of his disciples,  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> and he looked at Jesus as he
walked, and said, &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God!&quot;  <a name="C1V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:37</font></a> The two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus.  <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and said to them, &quot;What are you looking
for?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;Rabbi&quot; (which is to say, being
interpreted, Teacher), &quot;where are you staying?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Come, and see.&quot;
<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that
day. It was about <a href="#N4">the tenth hour.</a>  <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> One of the two who heard John,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.  <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> He first found his own brother,
Simon, and said to him, &quot;We have found the Messiah!&quot; (which is,
being interpreted, <a href="#N5">Christ</a>).  <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him, and said, &quot;You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas&quot; (which is by
interpretation, Peter).  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> On the next day, he was
determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,
&quot;Follow me.&quot;  <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of
the city of Andrew and Peter.  <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> Philip found Nathanael, and said
to him, &quot;We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the
prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:46</font></a> Nathanael said to him,
&quot;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&quot;
<p>Philip said to him, &quot;Come and see.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:47</font></a> Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to him, and said about him, &quot;Behold, an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:48</font></a> Nathanael said to him,
&quot;How do you know me?&quot;
<p>Jesus answered him, &quot;Before Philip called you,
when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:49</font></a> Nathanael answered
him, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:50</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig
tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than
these!&quot;  <a name="C1V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:51</font></a> He
said to him, &quot;Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter
you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending
on the Son of Man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> The third day, there
was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Jesus also was invited, with his
disciples, to the marriage.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> When the wine ran out, Jesus'
mother said to him, &quot;They have no wine.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My
hour has not yet come.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> His mother said to the
servants, &quot;Whatever he says to you, do it.&quot;  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Now there were six water pots of
stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing <a
href="#N6">two or three metretes</a> apiece.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Jesus said to them, &quot;Fill the water pots with water.&quot; They filled
them up to the brim.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> He
said to them, &quot;Now draw some out, and take it to the
ruler of the feast.&quot; So they took it.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> When the ruler of the feast tasted
the water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the
servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the
bridegroom,  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> and said to
him, &quot;Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have
drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until
now!&quot;  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> This beginning
of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his
disciples believed in him.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> After this, he went
down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples;
and they stayed there a few days.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> The Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> He found in the temple those who
sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> He made a whip of cords, and
threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured
out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> To those who sold the doves, he
said, &quot;Take these things out of here! Don't make my
Father's house a marketplace!&quot;  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> His disciples remembered that it
was written, &quot;Zeal for your house will eat me up.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> The Jews therefore
answered him, &quot;What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these
things?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The Jews therefore
said, &quot;Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you
raise it up in three days?&quot;  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> But he spoke of the temple of his
body.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> When therefore he
was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and
they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
<p> <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Now when he was in
Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name,
observing his signs which he did.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> But Jesus didn't trust himself to
them, because he knew everyone,  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> and because he didn't need for
anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now there was a man of
the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> The same came to him by night, and
said to him, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God,
for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born <a
href="#N8">anew,</a> he can't see the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Nicodemus said to him,
&quot;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time
into his mother's womb, and be born?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and
spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> That which is born of the flesh is
flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Don't marvel that I said to you,
'You must be born anew.'  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> The <a href="#N9">wind</a> blows
where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes
from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the
Spirit.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Nicodemus answered him,
&quot;How can these things be?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand
these things?  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Most
certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that
which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> If I told you earthly things and
you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
 <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> No one has ascended into
heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in
heaven.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> As Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
up,  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> that whoever believes
in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> For God so loved the world, that
he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not
perish, but have eternal life.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> For God didn't send his Son into
the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through
him.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> He who believes in
him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because
he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> This is the judgment, that the
light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the
light; for their works were evil.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> For everyone who does evil hates
the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.
 <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> But he who does the truth
comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been
done in God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> After these things,
Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with
them, and baptized.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> John
also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.
They came, and were baptized.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> For John was not yet thrown into
prison.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> There arose
therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with some Jews
about purification.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> They
came to John, and said to him, &quot;Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the
Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and
everyone is coming to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> John answered, &quot;A
man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> You yourselves testify that I
said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> He who has the bride is the
bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him,
rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This, my joy,
therefore is made full.  <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> He must increase, but I must
decrease.  <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> He who comes
from above is above all. He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth,
and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.  <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> What he has seen and heard, of
that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.  <a name="C3V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:33</font></a> He who has received his witness
has set his seal to this, that God is true.  <a name="C3V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:34</font></a> For he whom God has sent speaks
the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.  <a name="C3V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:35</font></a> The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into his hand.  <a name="C3V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:36</font></a> One who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but one who <a href="#N10">disobeys</a> the Son won't see
life, but the wrath of God remains on him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Therefore when the Lord
knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> (although Jesus himself didn't
baptize, but his disciples),  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> he left Judea, and departed into
Galilee.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> He needed to pass
through Samaria.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> So he
came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that
Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Jacob's well was there. Jesus
therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was
about <a href="#N11">the sixth hour</a>.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, &quot;Give me a
drink.&quot;  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> For
his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
<p> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> The Samaritan woman
therefore said to him, &quot;How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a
drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&quot; (For Jews have no dealings with
Samaritans.)
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Jesus answered her,
&quot;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says
to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have
given you living water.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> The woman said to him,
&quot;Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where
then have you that living water?  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Are you greater than our father,
Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children,
and his livestock?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Jesus answered her,
&quot;Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
 <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> but whoever drinks of the
water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I
will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal
life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> The woman said to him,
&quot;Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come
all the way here to draw.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Go, call your husband, and come here.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> The woman answered,
&quot;I have no husband.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to her, &quot;You said well, 'I have no
husband,'  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> for you have
had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you
have said truly.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> The woman said to him,
&quot;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people
ought to worship.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in
this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> You worship that which you don't
know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
 <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> But the hour comes, and
now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and
truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> God is spirit, and those who
worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> The woman said to him,
&quot;I know that Messiah comes,&quot; (he who is called Christ).
&quot;When he has come, he will declare to us all things.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;I am he, the one who speaks to you.&quot;
 <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> At this, his disciples
came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said,
&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; or, &quot;Why do you speak with
her?&quot;  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> So the woman
left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
 <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> &quot;Come, see a man who
told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> They went out of the
city, and were coming to him.  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> In the meanwhile, the disciples
urged him, saying, &quot;Rabbi, eat.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> But he said to them,
&quot;I have food to eat that you don't know
about.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> The disciples
therefore said one to another, &quot;Has anyone brought him something to
eat?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
accomplish his work.  <a name="C4V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:35</font></a> Don't you say, 'There are yet
four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and
look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.  <a name="C4V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:36</font></a> He who reaps receives wages, and
gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may
rejoice together.  <a name="C4V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:37</font></a> For in
this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'  <a name="C4V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:38</font></a> I sent you to reap that for which
you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their
labor.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:39</font></a> From that city many of
the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who
testified, &quot;He told me everything that I did.&quot;  <a name="C4V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:40</font></a> So when the Samaritans came to
him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.  <a name="C4V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:41</font></a> Many more believed because of his
word.  <a name="C4V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:42</font></a> They said to the
woman, &quot;Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have
heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior
of the world.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:43</font></a> After the two days he
went out from there and went into Galilee.  <a name="C4V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:44</font></a> For Jesus himself testified that
a prophet has no honor in his own country.  <a name="C4V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:45</font></a> So when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.  <a name="C4V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:46</font></a> Jesus came therefore again to
Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain
nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <a name="C4V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:47</font></a> When he heard that Jesus had come
out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would
come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.  <a name="C4V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:48</font></a> Jesus therefore said to him,
&quot;Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way
believe.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:49</font></a> The nobleman said to
him, &quot;Sir, come down before my child dies.&quot;  <a name="C4V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:50</font></a> Jesus said to him, &quot;Go your way. Your son lives.&quot; The man believed
the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.  <a name="C4V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:51</font></a> As he was now going down, his
servants met him and reported, saying &quot;Your child lives!&quot;
 <a name="C4V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:52</font></a> So he inquired of them
the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him,
&quot;Yesterday at the <a href="#N12">seventh hour,</a> the fever left
him.&quot;  <a name="C4V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:53</font></a> So the father
knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, &quot;Your son lives.&quot; He believed, as did his whole
house.  <a name="C4V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:54</font></a> This is again the
second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> After these things,
there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Now in Jerusalem by the sheep
gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, &quot;Bethesda,&quot;
having five porches.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> In
these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or
paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> for an angel of the Lord went down
at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped
in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever
disease he had.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> A certain
man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> When Jesus saw him lying there,
and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, &quot;Do you want to be made well?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> The sick man answered
him, &quot;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is
stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Arise, take up your mat, and walk.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Immediately, the man
was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
<p>Now it was the Sabbath on that day.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> So the Jews said to him who was
cured, &quot;It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the
mat.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up
your mat, and walk.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Then they asked him,
&quot;Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your mat,
and walk'?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> But he who was healed
didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the
place.
<p> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Afterward Jesus found
him in the temple, and said to him, &quot;Behold, you are
made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> The man went away, and
told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> For this cause the Jews
persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on
the Sabbath.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> But Jesus
answered them, &quot;My Father is still working, so I am
working, too.&quot;  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> For this cause therefore the Jews
sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Jesus therefore answered them,
&quot;Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing
of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he
does, these the Son also does likewise.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> For the Father has affection for
the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him
greater works than these, that you may marvel.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> For as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
 <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> that all may honor the Son, even
as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the
Father who sent him.
<p> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> &quot;Most certainly I tell you,
he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and
doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Most certainly, I tell you, the
hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice;
and those who hear will live.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> For as the Father has life in
himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> He also gave him authority to
execute judgment, because he is a son of man.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> Don't marvel at this, for the
hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
 <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> and will come out; those
who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of judgment.  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> I can of myself do nothing. As I
hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own
will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
<p> <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> &quot;If I testify about myself,
my witness is not valid.  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> It is another who testifies about
me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.  <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> You have sent to John, and he has
testified to the truth.  <a name="C5V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:34</font></a> But the testimony which I receive
is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
 <a name="C5V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:35</font></a> He was the burning and
shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
 <a name="C5V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:36</font></a> But the testimony which I
have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me
to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
has sent me.  <a name="C5V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:37</font></a> The Father
himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his
voice at any time, nor seen his form.  <a name="C5V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:38</font></a> You don't have his word living in
you; because you don't believe him whom he sent.
<p> <a name="C5V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:39</font></a> &quot;You search the Scriptures,
because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they
which testify about me.  <a name="C5V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:40</font></a> Yet you will not come to me, that
you may have life.  <a name="C5V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:41</font></a> I
don't receive glory from men.  <a name="C5V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:42</font></a> But I know you, that you don't
have God's love in yourselves.  <a name="C5V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:43</font></a> I have come in my Father's name,
and you don't receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will
receive him.  <a name="C5V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:44</font></a> How can you
believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don't seek the glory
that comes from the only God?
<p> <a name="C5V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:45</font></a> &quot;Don't think that I will
accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on
whom you have set your hope.  <a name="C5V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:46</font></a> For if you believed Moses, you
would believe me; for he wrote about me.  <a name="C5V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:47</font></a> But if you don't believe his
writings, how will you believe my words?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> After these things,
Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also
called the Sea of Tiberias.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> A great multitude followed him,
because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Jesus went up into the mountain,
and he sat there with his disciples.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Now the Passover, the feast of the
Jews, was at hand.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Jesus
therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was
coming to him, said to Philip, &quot;Where are we to buy
bread, that these may eat?&quot;  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> This he said to test him, for he
himself knew what he would do.
<p> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Philip answered him,
&quot;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
everyone of them may receive a little.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> One of his disciples,
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> &quot;There is a boy here who has
five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;Have the people sit down.&quot; Now there was much
grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
 <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Jesus took the loaves;
and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the
disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as
much as they desired.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> When they were filled, he said to
his disciples, &quot;Gather up the broken pieces which are
left over, that nothing be lost.&quot;  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> So they gathered them up, and
filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,
which were left over by those who had eaten.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> When therefore the people saw the
sign which Jesus did, they said, &quot;This is truly the prophet who comes
into the world.&quot;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Jesus therefore, perceiving that
they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew
again to the mountain by himself.
<p> <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> When evening came, his
disciples went down to the sea,  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> and they entered into the boat,
and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had
not come to them.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> The sea
was tossed by a great wind blowing.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> When therefore they had rowed
about <a href="#N13">twenty-five or thirty stadia,</a> they saw Jesus
walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N14">*</a></sup></font> and drawing near to the boat; and they were
afraid.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> But he said to
them, &quot;<a href="#N15">It is I</a>. Don't be
afraid.&quot;  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> They
were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat
was at the land where they were going.
<p> <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> On the next day, the
multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no
other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and
that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat, but his
disciples had gone away alone.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> However boats from Tiberias came
near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given
thanks.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they
themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
 <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> When they found him on
the other side of the sea, they asked him, &quot;Rabbi, when did you come
here?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because
you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> Don't work for the food which
perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of
Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;What must we do, that we may work the works of God?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;This is the work of God, that you believe in him
whom he has sent.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe
you? What work do you do?  <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> Our fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of <a
href="#N16">heaven</a> to eat.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> Jesus therefore said
to them, &quot;Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses
who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true
bread out of heaven.  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> For
the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to
the world.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;Lord, always give us this bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not
be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.  <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> But I told you that you have seen
me, and yet you don't believe.  <a name="C6V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:37</font></a> All those who the Father gives me
will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.  <a name="C6V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:38</font></a> For I have come down from heaven,
not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.  <a name="C6V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:39</font></a> This is the will of my Father who
sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should
raise him up at the last day.  <a name="C6V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:40</font></a> This is the will of the one who
sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:41</font></a> The Jews therefore
murmured concerning him, because he said, &quot;I am the
bread which came down out of heaven.&quot;  <a name="C6V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:42</font></a> They said, &quot;Isn't this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does
he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:43</font></a> Therefore Jesus
answered them, &quot;Don't murmur among yourselves.
 <a name="C6V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:44</font></a> No one can come to me
unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the
last day.  <a name="C6V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:45</font></a> It is written
in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N18">*</a></sup></font> Therefore everyone who
hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.  <a name="C6V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:46</font></a> Not that anyone has seen the
Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.  <a name="C6V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:47</font></a> Most certainly, I tell you, he
who believes in me has eternal life.  <a name="C6V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:48</font></a> I am the bread of life.  <a name="C6V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:49</font></a> Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died.  <a name="C6V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:50</font></a> This is the bread which comes
down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.  <a name="C6V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:51</font></a> I am the living bread which came
down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my
flesh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:52</font></a> The Jews therefore
contended with one another, saying, &quot;How can this man give us his
flesh to eat?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:53</font></a> Jesus therefore said
to them, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat
the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don't have life in
yourselves.  <a name="C6V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:54</font></a> He who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at
the last day.  <a name="C6V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:55</font></a> For my
flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <a name="C6V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:56</font></a> He who eats my flesh and drinks
my blood lives in me, and I in him.  <a name="C6V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:57</font></a> As the living Father sent me, and
I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live
because of me.  <a name="C6V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:58</font></a> This is
the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna,
and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.&quot;  <a name="C6V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:59</font></a> These things he said in the
synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<p> <a name="C6V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:60</font></a> Therefore many of his
disciples, when they heard this, said, &quot;This is a hard saying! Who
can listen to it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:61</font></a> But Jesus knowing in
himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, &quot;Does this cause you to stumble?  <a name="C6V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:62</font></a> Then what if you would see the
Son of Man ascending to where he was before?  <a name="C6V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:63</font></a> It is the spirit who gives life.
The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and
are life.  <a name="C6V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:64</font></a> But there are
some of you who don't believe.&quot; For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would
betray him.  <a name="C6V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:65</font></a> He said,
&quot;For this cause have I said to you that no one can
come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:66</font></a> At this, many of his
disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <a name="C6V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:67</font></a> Jesus said therefore to the
twelve, &quot;You don't also want to go away, do
you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:68</font></a> Simon Peter answered
him, &quot;Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
 <a name="C6V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:69</font></a> We have come to believe
and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:70</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a
devil?&quot;  <a name="C6V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:71</font></a> Now
he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would
betray him, being one of the twelve.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> After these things,
Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the
Jews sought to kill him.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Now the feast of the Jews, the
Feast of Booths, was at hand.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> His brothers therefore said to
him, &quot;Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also
may see your works which you do.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> For no one does anything in
secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things,
reveal yourself to the world.&quot;  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> For even his brothers didn't
believe in him.
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Jesus therefore said to
them, &quot;My time has not yet come, but your time is
always ready.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> The world
can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its
works are evil.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> You go up
to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not
yet fulfilled.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> Having said these
things to them, he stayed in Galilee.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> But when his brothers had gone up
to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in
secret.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> The Jews
therefore sought him at the feast, and said, &quot;Where is he?&quot;
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> There was much murmuring
among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, &quot;He is a good
man.&quot; Others said, &quot;Not so, but he leads the multitude
astray.&quot;  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Yet no one
spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> But when it was now the midst of
the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> The Jews therefore marveled,
saying, &quot;How does this man know letters, having never been
educated?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Jesus therefore
answered them, &quot;My teaching is not mine, but his who
sent me.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> If anyone
desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is
from God, or if I am speaking from myself.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> He who speaks from himself seeks
his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and
no unrighteousness is in him.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Didn't Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> The multitude
answered, &quot;You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
 <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Moses has given you
circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the
Sabbath you circumcise a boy.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> If a boy receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with
me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Don't judge according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Therefore some of them
of Jerusalem said, &quot;Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> Behold, he speaks openly, and
they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this
is truly the Christ?  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> However we know where this man
comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes
from.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> Jesus therefore cried
out in the temple, teaching and saying, &quot;You both
know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who
sent me is true, whom you don't know.  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> I know him, because I am from
him, and he sent me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> They sought therefore
to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet
come.  <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> But of the
multitude, many believed in him. They said, &quot;When the Christ comes,
he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?&quot;
 <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> The Pharisees heard the
multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and
the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
<p> <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> Then Jesus said, &quot;I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him
who sent me.  <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> You will
seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> The Jews therefore
said among themselves, &quot;Where will this man go that we won't find
him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
 <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> What is this word that he
said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I
am, you can't come'?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> Now on the last and
greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
 <a name="C7V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:38</font></a> He who believes in me, as
the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living
water.&quot;  <a name="C7V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:39</font></a> But
he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to
receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet
glorified.
<p> <a name="C7V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:40</font></a> Many of the multitude
therefore, when they heard these words, said, &quot;This is truly the
prophet.&quot;  <a name="C7V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:41</font></a> Others
said, &quot;This is the Christ.&quot; But some said, &quot;What, does the
Christ come out of Galilee?  <a name="C7V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:42</font></a> Hasn't the Scripture said that
the Christ comes of the seed of David,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N19">*</a></sup></font> and from Bethlehem,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> the village
where David was?&quot;  <a name="C7V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:43</font></a> So
there arose a division in the multitude because of him.  <a name="C7V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:44</font></a> Some of them would have arrested
him, but no one laid hands on him.  <a name="C7V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:45</font></a> The officers therefore came to
the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, &quot;Why didn't
you bring him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:46</font></a> The officers answered,
&quot;No man ever spoke like this man!&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:47</font></a> The Pharisees
therefore answered them, &quot;You aren't also led astray, are you?
 <a name="C7V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:48</font></a> Have any of the rulers
believed in him, or of the Pharisees?  <a name="C7V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:49</font></a> But this multitude that doesn't
know the law is accursed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:50</font></a> Nicodemus (he who came
to him by night, being one of them) said to them,  <a name="C7V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:51</font></a> &quot;Does our law judge a man,
unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:52</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has
arisen out of Galilee.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N21">*</a></sup></font>&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:53</font></a> Everyone went to his
own house,  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> but Jesus went
to the Mount of Olives.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Now very early in the morning, he
came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down,
and taught them.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> The
scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set
her in the midst,  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> they
told him, &quot;Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.
 <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Now in our law, Moses
commanded us to stone such.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N22">*</a></sup></font> What then do you say about her?&quot;
 <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> They said this testing
him, that they might have something to accuse him of.
<p>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
 <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> But when they continued
asking him, he looked up and said to them, &quot;He who is
without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.&quot;
 <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> Again he stooped down, and
with his finger wrote on the ground.
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> They, when they heard
it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning
from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman
where she was, in the middle.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Jesus, standing up, saw her and
said, &quot;Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one
condemn you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> She said, &quot;No
one, Lord.&quot;
<p>Jesus said, &quot;Neither do I condemn you. Go your
way. From now on, sin no more.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the light of the
world.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>
He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> The Pharisees
therefore said to him, &quot;You testify about yourself. Your testimony is
not valid.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is
true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't
know where I came from, or where I am going.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> You judge according to the flesh.
I judge no one.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Even if I
do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> It's
also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N24">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> I am one who testifies about
myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;Where is your Father?&quot;
<p>Jesus answered, &quot;You know neither me, nor my
Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot;
 <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Jesus spoke these words
in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him,
because his hour had not yet come.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Jesus said therefore again to
them, &quot;I am going away, and you will seek me, and you
will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> The Jews therefore
said, &quot;Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I
am going, you can't come?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> He said to them, &quot;You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this
world. I am not of this world.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> I said therefore to you that you
will die in your sins; for unless you believe that <a href="#N25">I am</a>
he, you will die in your sins.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> They said therefore to
him, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;Just what I have been saying
to you from the beginning.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> I have many things to speak and
to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things
which I heard from him, these I say to the world.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> They didn't understand
that he spoke to them about the Father.  <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> Jesus therefore said to them,
&quot;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you
will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father
taught me, I say these things.  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> He who sent me is with me. The
Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing
to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> As he spoke these
things, many believed in him.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> Jesus therefore said to those
Jews who had believed him, &quot;If you remain in my word,
then you are truly my disciples.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> You will know the truth, and the
truth will make you free.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How
do you say, 'You will be made free?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin
is the bondservant of sin.  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> A bondservant doesn't live in the
house forever. A son remains forever.  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> If therefore the Son makes you
free, you will be free indeed.  <a name="C8V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:37</font></a> I know that you are Abraham's
seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
 <a name="C8V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:38</font></a> I say the things which I
have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen
with your father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:39</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;Our father is Abraham.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;If you were Abraham's
children, you would do the works of Abraham.  <a name="C8V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:40</font></a> But now you seek to kill me, a
man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do
this.  <a name="C8V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:41</font></a> You do the works of
your father.&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;We were not born of sexual immorality. We have
one Father, God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:42</font></a> Therefore Jesus said
to them, &quot;If God were your father, you would love me,
for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but
he sent me.  <a name="C8V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:43</font></a> Why don't you
understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word.  <a name="C8V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:44</font></a> You are of your father, the
devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer
from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a
liar, and its father.  <a name="C8V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:45</font></a> But
because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.  <a name="C8V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:46</font></a> Which of you convicts me of sin?
If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?  <a name="C8V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:47</font></a> He who is of God hears the words
of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of
God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:48</font></a> Then the Jews answered
him, &quot;Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a
demon?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:49</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you
dishonor me.  <a name="C8V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:50</font></a> But I don't
seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.  <a name="C8V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:51</font></a> Most certainly, I tell you, if a
person keeps my word, he will never see death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:52</font></a> Then the Jews said to
him, &quot;Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the
prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will
never taste of death.'  <a name="C8V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:53</font></a> Are you greater than our father,
Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to
be?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:54</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father
who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.  <a name="C8V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:55</font></a> You have not known him, but I
know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But
I know him, and keep his word.  <a name="C8V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:56</font></a> Your father Abraham rejoiced to
see my day. He saw it, and was glad.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:57</font></a> The Jews therefore
said to him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
Abraham?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:58</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into
existence, <a href="#N27">I AM.</a>&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:59</font></a> Therefore they took up
stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple,
having gone through the midst of them, and so passed by.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> As he passed by, he saw
a man blind from birth.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> His disciples asked him,
&quot;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born
blind?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the
works of God might be revealed in him.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> I must work the works of him who
sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
 <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> While I am in the world, I
am the light of the world.&quot;  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> When he had said this, he spat on
the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with
the mud,  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> and said to him,
&quot;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&quot; (which
means &quot;Sent&quot;). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
 <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> The neighbors therefore,
and those who saw that he was blind before, said, &quot;Isn't this he who
sat and begged?&quot;  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Others were saying, &quot;It is
he.&quot; Still others were saying, &quot;He looks like him.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am he.&quot;  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> They therefore were asking him,
&quot;How were your eyes opened?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> He answered, &quot;A
man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and
washed, and I received sight.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Then they asked him,
&quot;Where is he?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> They brought him who
had been blind to the Pharisees.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> It was a Sabbath when Jesus made
the mud and opened his eyes.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Again therefore the Pharisees
also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, &quot;He put
mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> Some therefore of the
Pharisees said, &quot;This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep
the Sabbath.&quot; Others said, &quot;How can a man who is a sinner do
such signs?&quot; There was division among them.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Therefore they asked the blind
man again, &quot;What do you say about him, because he opened your
eyes?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;He is a prophet.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> The Jews therefore did
not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his
sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
 <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> and asked them, &quot;Is
this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> His parents answered
them, &quot;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
 <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> but how he now sees, we
don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him.
He will speak for himself.&quot;  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> His parents said these things
because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any
man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
 <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Therefore his parents
said, &quot;He is of age. Ask him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> So they called the man
who was blind a second time, and said to him, &quot;Give glory to God. We
know that this man is a sinner.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> He therefore answered,
&quot;I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I
was blind, now I see.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> They said to him
again, &quot;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear
it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> They insulted him and
said, &quot;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> We know that God has spoken to
Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> The man answered them,
&quot;How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my
eyes.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> We know that God
doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does
his will, he listens to him.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N28">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> Since the world began it has
never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
 <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> If this man were not from
God, he could do nothing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?&quot; They
threw him out.
<p> <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> Jesus heard that they
had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, &quot;Do you
believe in the Son of God?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> He answered, &quot;Who
is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> He said, &quot;Lord, I
believe!&quot; and he worshiped him.
<p> <a name="C9V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:39</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't
see may see; and that those who see may become blind.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> Those of the Pharisees
who were with him heard these things, and said to him, &quot;Are we also
blind?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now
you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> &quot;Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the
door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> But
one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> The gatekeeper opens the gate for
him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name,
and leads them out.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Whenever he brings out his own
sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his
voice.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> They will by no
means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the
voice of strangers.&quot;  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Jesus spoke this parable to them,
but they didn't understand what he was telling them.
<p> <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Jesus therefore said
to them again, &quot;Most certainly, I tell you, I am the
sheep's door.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> All who
came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to
them.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> I am the door. If
anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and
will find pasture.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> The
thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have
life, and may have it abundantly.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> I am the good shepherd.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N29">*</a></sup></font> The good
shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> He who is a hired hand, and not
a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the
sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> The hired hand flees because he
is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> I am the good shepherd. I know
my own, and I'm known by my own;  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> even as the Father knows me, and
I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> I have other sheep, which are
not of this fold.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N30">*</a></sup></font> I must bring them also, and they will hear
my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Therefore the Father loves me,
because I lay down my life,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N31">*</a></sup></font> that I may take it again.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> No one takes it away from me,
but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Therefore a division
arose again among the Jews because of these words.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> Many of them said, &quot;He has
a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?&quot;  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> Others said, &quot;These are not
the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to
open the eyes of the blind, is it?&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N32">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> It was the <a
href="#N33">Feast of the Dedication</a> at Jerusalem.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> It was winter, and Jesus was
walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> The Jews therefore came around
him and said to him, &quot;How long will you hold us in suspense? If you
are the Christ, tell us plainly.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I
do in my Father's name, these testify about me.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> But you don't believe, because
you are not of my sheep, as I told you.  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> I give eternal life to them.
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
 <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my
Father's hand.  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> I and the
Father are one.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> Therefore Jews took
up stones again to stone him.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> Jesus answered them, &quot;I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which
of those works do you stone me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> The Jews answered
him, &quot;We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because
you, being a man, make yourself God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are
gods?'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N34">*</a></sup></font>
 <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> If he called them gods,
to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> do you say of him whom the
Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I
said, 'I am the Son of God?'  <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> If I don't do the works of my
Father, don't believe me.  <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> But if I do them, though you
don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> They sought again to
seize him, and he went out of their hand.  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> He went away again beyond the
Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he
stayed.  <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> Many came to
him. They said, &quot;John indeed did no sign, but everything that John
said about this man is true.&quot;  <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> Many believed in him there.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Now a certain man was
sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.
 <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> It was that Mary who had
anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose
brother, Lazarus, was sick.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> The sisters therefore sent to
him, saying, &quot;Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick.&quot;  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> But when
Jesus heard it, he said, &quot;This sickness is not to
death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by
it.&quot;  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Now
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> When therefore he heard that he
was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Then after this he said to the
disciples, &quot;Let's go into Judea again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> The disciples told
him, &quot;Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you
going there again?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in
the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
 <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> But if a man walks in
the night, he stumbles, because the light isn't in him.&quot;
 <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> He said these things,
and after that, he said to them, &quot;Our friend,
Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of
sleep.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> The disciples
therefore said, &quot;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Now Jesus had spoken
of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
 <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> So Jesus said to them
plainly then, &quot;Lazarus is dead.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> I am glad for your sakes that I
was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to
him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Thomas therefore, who
is called <a href="#N35">Didymus,</a> said to his fellow disciples,
&quot;Let's go also, that we may die with him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> So when Jesus came,
he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about <a href="#N36">fifteen stadia</a> away.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> Many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
 <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> Then when Martha heard
that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
 <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Therefore Martha said to
Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have
died.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Even now I know
that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.&quot;  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will rise again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Martha said to him,
&quot;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last
day.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes
in me will still live, even if he dies.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> She said to him,
&quot;Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's
Son, he who comes into the world.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> When she had said
this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying,
&quot;The Teacher is here, and is calling you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> When she heard this,
she arose quickly, and went to him.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Now Jesus had not yet come into
the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> Then the Jews who were with her
in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, saying, &quot;She is going to the tomb
to weep there.&quot;  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> Therefore when Mary came to
where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him,
&quot;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have
died.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> When Jesus therefore
saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit, and was troubled,  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> and said, &quot;Where have you laid him?&quot;
<p>They told him, &quot;Lord, come and see.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> Jesus wept.
<p> <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> The Jews therefore
said, &quot;See how much affection he had for him!&quot;  <a name="C11V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:37</font></a> Some of them said,
&quot;Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have
also kept this man from dying?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> Jesus therefore,
again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a
stone lay against it.  <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;Take away the stone.&quot;
<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, &quot;Lord, by
this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would
see God's glory?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:41</font></a> So they took away the
stone <a href="#N37">from the place where the dead man was lying.</a>
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, &quot;Father, I thank
you that you listened to me.  <a name="C11V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:42</font></a> I know that you always listen to
me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they
may believe that you sent me.&quot;  <a name="C11V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:43</font></a> When he had said this, he cried
with a loud voice, &quot;Lazarus, come out!&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:44</font></a> He who was dead came
out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around
with a cloth.
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;Free him, and let him
go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:45</font></a> Therefore many of the
Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.  <a name="C11V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:46</font></a> But some of them went away to
the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.  <a name="C11V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:47</font></a> The chief priests therefore and
the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, &quot;What are we doing? For
this man does many signs.  <a name="C11V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:48</font></a> If we leave him alone like this,
everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both
our place and our nation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:49</font></a> But a certain one of
them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &quot;You know
nothing at all,  <a name="C11V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:50</font></a> nor do
you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for
the people, and that the whole nation not perish.&quot;  <a name="C11V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:51</font></a> Now he didn't say this of
himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would
die for the nation,  <a name="C11V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:52</font></a> and
not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad.  <a name="C11V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:53</font></a> So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death.  <a name="C11V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:54</font></a> Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.
<p> <a name="C11V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:55</font></a> Now the Passover of
the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before
the Passover, to purify themselves.  <a name="C11V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:56</font></a> Then they sought for Jesus and
spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, &quot;What do you
think--that he isn't coming to the feast at all?&quot;  <a name="C11V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:57</font></a> Now the chief priests and the
Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report
it, that they might seize him.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Then six days before
the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead,
whom he raised from the dead.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> So they made him a supper there.
Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Mary, therefore, took a
<a href="#N38">pound</a> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house
was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> &quot;Why wasn't this ointment
sold for <a href="#N39">three hundred denarii,</a> and given to the
poor?&quot;  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Now he said
this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and
having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> But Jesus said, &quot;Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my
burial.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> For you always
have the poor with you, but you don't always have me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> A large crowd
therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for
Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised
from the dead.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> But the
chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> because on account of him many
of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
<p> <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> On the next day a
great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was
coming to Jerusalem,  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> they took the branches of the
palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, &quot;<a
href="#N40">Hosanna</a>! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N41">*</a></sup></font>
the King of Israel!&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> Jesus, having found a
young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> &quot;Don't be afraid, daughter
of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> His disciples didn't understand
these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered
that these things were written about him, and that they had done these
things to him.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> The
multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the
tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> For this cause also the
multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
 <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> The Pharisees therefore
said among themselves, &quot;See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the
world has gone after him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> Now there were
certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> These, therefore, came to
Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying,
&quot;Sir, we want to see Jesus.&quot;  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> Philip came and told Andrew, and
in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Jesus answered them, &quot;The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
 <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> Most certainly I tell
you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by
itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> He who loves his life will lose
it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
 <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> If anyone serves me, let
him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves
me, the Father will honor him.
<p> <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> &quot;Now my soul is troubled.
What shall I say? 'Father, save me from this time?' But for this cause I
came to this time.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> Father, glorify your
name!&quot;
<p>Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, &quot;I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> The multitude
therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others
said, &quot;An angel has spoken to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.
 <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> Now is the judgment of
this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> And I, if I am lifted up from
the earth, will draw all people to myself.&quot;  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> But he said this, signifying by
what kind of death he should die.  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> The multitude answered him,
&quot;We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N43">*</a></sup></font> How do you
say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is
this Son of Man?&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> Jesus therefore said
to them, &quot;Yet a little while the light is with you.
Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't overtake you. He who
walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going.  <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> While you have the light,
believe in the light, that you may become children of light.&quot;
Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
 <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> But though he had done
so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe in him,  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> that the word of Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Lord, who has believed our report?
<dd>To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> For this cause they
couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> &quot;He has blinded
their eyes and he hardened their heart,
<dd>lest they should see with their eyes,
<dd>and perceive with their heart,
<dd>and would turn,
<dd>and I would heal them.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> Isaiah said these
things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N46">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> Nevertheless even of the rulers
many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it,
so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,  <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> for they loved men's praise more
than God's praise.
<p> <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> Jesus cried out and
said, &quot;Whoever believes in me, believes not in me,
but in him who sent me.  <a name="C12V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:45</font></a> He who sees me sees him who sent
me.  <a name="C12V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:46</font></a> I have come as a
light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the
darkness.  <a name="C12V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:47</font></a> If anyone
listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge him. For I came
not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <a name="C12V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:48</font></a> He who rejects me, and doesn't
receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the
same will judge him in the last day.  <a name="C12V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:49</font></a> For I spoke not from myself, but
the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and
what I should speak.  <a name="C12V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:50</font></a> I
know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I
speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Now before the feast
of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would
depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> After supper, the devil having
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
 <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Jesus, knowing that the
Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from
God, and was going to God,  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> arose from supper, and laid aside
his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
 <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Then he poured water into
the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with
the towel that was wrapped around him.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Then he came to Simon Peter. He
said to him, &quot;Lord, do you wash my feet?&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;You don't know what I am doing now, but you will
understand later.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Peter said to him,
&quot;You will never wash my feet!&quot;
<p>Jesus answered him, &quot;If I don't wash you, you have
no part with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Simon Peter said to
him, &quot;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet
washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of
you.&quot;  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> For he
knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, &quot;You are not all clean.&quot;  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> So when he had washed their
feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them,
&quot;Do you know what I have done to you?  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> You call me, 'Teacher' and
'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
 <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> For I have given you an
example, that you also should do as I have done to you.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, a
servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than
he who sent him.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> If you
know these things, blessed are you if you do them.  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> I don't speak concerning all of
you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled,
'He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> From now on, I tell you before
it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, he
who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me,
receives him who sent me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> When Jesus had said
this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, &quot;Most
certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> The disciples looked
at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> One of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> Simon Peter therefore beckoned
to him, and said to him, &quot;Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> He, leaning back, as
he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him, &quot;Lord, who is it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Jesus therefore
answered, &quot;It is he to whom I will give this piece of
bread when I have dipped it.&quot; So when he had dipped the piece
of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> After the piece of bread, then
Satan entered into him.
<p>Then Jesus said to him, &quot;What you do, do
quickly.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> Now no man at the
table knew why he said this to him.  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> For some thought, because Judas
had the money box, that Jesus said to him, &quot;Buy what things we need
for the feast,&quot; or that he should give something to the poor.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Therefore, having received that
morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
<p> <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> When he had gone out,
Jesus said, &quot;Now the Son of Man has been glorified,
and God has been glorified in him.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> If God has been glorified in
him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> Little
children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and
as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell
you.  <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> A new commandment I
give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that
you also love one another.  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> By this everyone will know that
you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:36</font></a> Simon Peter said to
him, &quot;Lord, where are you going?&quot;
<p>Jesus answered, &quot;Where I am going, you can't
follow now, but you will follow afterwards.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:37</font></a> Peter said to him,
&quot;Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:38</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I
tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three
times.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> &quot;Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe
also in me.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> In my
Father's house are many homes. If it weren't so, I would have told you. I
am going to prepare a place for you.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> If I go and prepare a place for
you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am,
you may be there also.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> Where I go, you know, and you
know the way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Thomas said to him,
&quot;Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the
way?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes
to the Father, except through me.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> If you had known me, you would
have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen
him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> Philip said to him,
&quot;Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Have I been with you such a long time, and do you
not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you
say, 'Show us the Father?'  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Don't you believe that I am in
the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not
from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Believe me that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake.
 <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Most certainly I tell
you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he
will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Whatever you will ask in my
name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> If you will ask anything in my
name, I will do it.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> If
you love me, keep my commandments.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> I will pray to the Father, and
he will give you another <a href="#N48">Counselor,</a> that he may be with
you forever,-- <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> the Spirit
of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see him, neither
knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.
 <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> I will not leave you
orphans. I will come to you.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> Yet a little while, and the
world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will
live also.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> In that day
you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> One who has my commandments, and
keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be
loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to
him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Judas (not Iscariot)
said to him, &quot;Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal
yourself to us, and not to the world?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father
will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.
 <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> He who doesn't love me
doesn't keep my words. The word which you hear isn't mine, but the
Father's who sent me.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> I
have said these things to you, while still living with you.  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> But the Counselor, the Holy
Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all
things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> Peace I leave with you. My peace
I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don't let your heart
be troubled, neither let it be fearful.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> You heard how I told you, 'I go
away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced,
because I said 'I am going to my Father;' for the Father is greater than
I.  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Now I have told you
before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> I will no more speak much with
you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> But that the world may know that
I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise,
let us go from here.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> &quot;I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Every branch in me that doesn't
bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that
it may bear more fruit.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> You are already pruned clean
because of the word which I have spoken to you.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Remain in me, and I in you. As
the branch can't bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so
neither can you, unless you remain in me.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> I am the vine. You are the
branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit,
for apart from me you can do nothing.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> If a man doesn't remain in me, he
is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw
them into the fire, and they are burned.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> If you remain in me, and my words
remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for
you.
<p> <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> &quot;In this is my Father
glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> Even as the Father has
loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> If you keep my commandments, you
will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and
remain in his love.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> I
have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that
your joy may be made full.
<p> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> &quot;This is my commandment,
that you love one another, even as I have loved you.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> Greater love has no one than
this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> You are my friends, if you do
whatever I command you.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> No longer do I call you
servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord does. But I have
called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have
made known to you.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> You
didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go
and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will
ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
<p> <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> &quot;I command these things to
you, that you may love one another.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> If the world hates you, you know
that it has hated me before it hated you.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> If you were of the world, the
world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I
chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> Remember the word that I said to
you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N49">*</a></sup></font> If they persecuted me, they
will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
 <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> But all these things
will they do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know him who
sent me.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> If I had not
come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no
excuse for their sin.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> He
who hates me, hates my Father also.  <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> If I hadn't done among them the
works which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin. But now have they
seen and also hated both me and my Father.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> But this happened so that the
word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me
without a cause.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p> <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> &quot;When the <a
href="#N51">Counselor</a> has come, whom I will send to you from the
Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify
about me.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> You will also
testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> &quot;These
things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble.
 <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> They will put you out of
the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that
he offers service to God.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> They will do these things<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N52">*</a></sup></font> because
they have not known the Father, nor me.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> But I have told you these things,
so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them.
I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
 <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> But now I am going to him
who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> But because I have told you these
things, sorrow has filled your heart.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Nevertheless I tell you the
truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the
Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> When he has come, he will convict
the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> about sin, because they don't
believe in me;  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> about
righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won't see me any
more;  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> about judgment,
because the prince of this world has been judged.
<p> <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> &quot;I have yet many things to
tell you, but you can't bear them now.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> However when he, the Spirit of
truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak
from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you
things that are coming.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> He will glorify me, for he will
take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> All things whatever the Father
has are mine; therefore I said that he <a href="#N53">takes</a> of mine,
and will declare it to you.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> A little while, and you will not
see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> Some of his disciples
therefore said to one another, &quot;What is this that he says to us,
'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little
while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to
the Father?'&quot;  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> They said therefore, &quot;What
is this that he says, 'A little while?' We don't
know what he is saying.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> Therefore Jesus
perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, &quot;Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I
said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and
you will see me?'  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Most
certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will
rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
 <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> A woman, when she gives
birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered
the child, she doesn't remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a
human being is born into the world.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> Therefore you now have sorrow,
but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will
take your joy away from you.
<p> <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> &quot;In that day you will ask
me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the
Father in my name, he will give it to you.  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> Until now, you have asked
nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made
full.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> I have spoken
these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I
will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly
about the Father.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> In
that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you, that I will pray
to the Father for you,  <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> for the Father himself loves
you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from
God.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> I came out from the
Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to
the Father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> His disciples said to
him, &quot;Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
 <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> Now we know that you
know all things, and don't need for anyone to question you. By this we
believe that you came forth from God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Do you now believe?  <a name="C16V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:32</font></a> Behold, the time is coming, yes,
and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place,
and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is
with me.  <a name="C16V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:33</font></a> I have told you
these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have
oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Jesus said these
things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, &quot;Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son
may also glorify you;  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> even as you gave him authority
over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
 <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> This is eternal life,
that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus
Christ.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> I glorified you
on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
 <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Now, Father, glorify me
with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world
existed.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> I revealed your
name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were
yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Now they have known that all
things whatever you have given me are from you,  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> for the words which you have
given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure
that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
 <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> I pray for them. I don't
pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are
yours.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> All things that
are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
 <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> I am no more in the
world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father,
keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one,
even as we are.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> While I
was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have
given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> But now I come to you, and I say
these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in
themselves.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> I have given
them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> I pray not that you would take
them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.

<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> When Jesus had spoken
these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where
there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Now Judas, who betrayed him, also
knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> Judas then, having taken a
detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the
Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> Jesus therefore, knowing all the
things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;I am he.&quot;
<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> When therefore he said to them,
&quot;I am he,&quot; they went backward, and fell
to the ground.
<p> <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> Again therefore he
asked them, &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let
these go their way,&quot;  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> that the word might be fulfilled

<p> <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> Simon Peter
therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant,
and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Jesus therefore said to Peter,
&quot;Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the
Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> So the detachment,
the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and
bound him,  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> and led him
to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest
that year.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Now it was
Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should
perish for the people.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Simon Peter followed Jesus, as
did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> but Peter was standing at the
door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Then the maid who kept the door
said to Peter, &quot;Are you also one of this man's disciples?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am not.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Now the servants and
the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was
cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and
warming himself.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> The
high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his
teaching.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> Jesus answered
him, &quot;I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in
synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing
in secret.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Why do you
ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these
know the things which I said.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> When he had said
this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying,
&quot;Do you answer the high priest like that?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if
well, why do you beat me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> Annas sent him bound
to Caiaphas, the high priest.  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore to him, &quot;You aren't also one of
his disciples, are you?&quot;
<p>He denied it, and said, &quot;I am not.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> One of the servants
of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off,
said, &quot;Didn't I see you in the garden with him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> Peter therefore
denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
<p> <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> They led Jesus
therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they
themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be
defiled, but might eat the Passover.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> Pilate therefore went out to
them, and said, &quot;What accusation do you bring against this man?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> They answered him,
&quot;If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered him up
to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> Pilate therefore said
to them, &quot;Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your
law.&quot;
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, &quot;It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death,&quot;  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> that the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
<p> <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> Pilate therefore
entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him,
&quot;Are you the King of the Jews?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:34</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you
about me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:35</font></a> Pilate answered,
&quot;I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered
you to me. What have you done?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:36</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of
this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to
the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:37</font></a> Pilate therefore said
to him, &quot;Are you a king then?&quot;
<p>Jesus answered, &quot;You say that I am a king. For
this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the
world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth
listens to my voice.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:38</font></a> Pilate said to him,
&quot;What is truth?&quot;
<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them,
&quot;I find no basis for a charge against him.  <a name="C18V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:39</font></a> But you have a custom, that I
should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to
release to you the King of the Jews?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:40</font></a> Then they all shouted
again, saying, &quot;Not this man, but Barabbas!&quot; Now Barabbas was a
robber.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> So Pilate then took
Jesus, and flogged him.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> The soldiers twisted thorns into
a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
 <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> They kept saying,
&quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot; and they kept slapping him.
<p> <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> Then Pilate went out
again, and said to them, &quot;Behold, I bring him out to you, that you
may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> Jesus therefore came
out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to
them, &quot;Behold, the man!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> When therefore the
chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying,
&quot;Crucify! Crucify!&quot;
<p>Pilate said to them, &quot;Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I
find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> The Jews answered him,
&quot;We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself the Son of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> When therefore Pilate
heard this saying, he was more afraid.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> He entered into the Praetorium
again, and said to Jesus, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; But Jesus gave
him no answer.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Pilate
therefore said to him, &quot;Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know
that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;You would have no power at all against me, unless it were
given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater
sin.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> At this, Pilate was
seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, &quot;If you
release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a
king speaks against Caesar!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> When Pilate therefore
heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat
at a place called &quot;The Pavement,&quot; but in Hebrew,
&quot;Gabbatha.&quot;  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> Now it was the Preparation Day
of the Passover, at about <a href="#N56">the sixth hour.</a> He said to
the Jews, &quot;Behold, your King!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> They cried out,
&quot;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&quot;
<p>Pilate said to them, &quot;Shall I crucify your King?&quot;
<p>The chief priests answered, &quot;We have no king but Caesar!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> So then he delivered
him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> He went out, bearing his cross,
to the place called &quot;The Place of a Skull,&quot; which is called in
Hebrew, &quot;Golgotha,&quot;  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> where they crucified him, and
with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> Pilate wrote a title also, and
put it on the cross. There was written, &quot;JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING
OF THE JEWS.&quot;  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> Therefore many of the Jews read
this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and
it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> The chief priests of the Jews
therefore said to Pilate, &quot;Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but,
'he said, I am King of the Jews.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Pilate answered,
&quot;What I have written, I have written.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> Then the soldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to
every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Then they said to one another,
&quot;Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will
be,&quot; that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;They parted my garments among them.
<dd>For my cloak they cast lots.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N57">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>Therefore the soldiers did these things.  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> But there were standing by the
cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> Therefore when Jesus saw his
mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his
mother, &quot;Woman, behold your son!&quot;  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> Then he said to the disciple,
&quot;Behold, your mother!&quot; From that hour,
the disciple took her to his own home.
<p> <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> After this, Jesus, <a
href="#N58">seeing</a> that all things were now finished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, said, &quot;I am
thirsty.&quot;  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> Now a vessel full of vinegar was
set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it
at his mouth.  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> When Jesus
therefore had received the vinegar, he said, &quot;It is
finished.&quot; He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
<p> <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> Therefore the Jews,
because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on
the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
 <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> Therefore the soldiers
came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
with him;  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> but when they
came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his
legs.  <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> However one of the
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water
came out.  <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> He who has
seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the
truth, that you may believe.  <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> For these things happened, that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, &quot;A bone of him will not be
broken.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N59">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C19V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:37</font></a> Again another Scripture says,
&quot;They will look on him whom they pierced.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N60">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> After these things,
Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave
him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.  <a name="C19V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:39</font></a> Nicodemus, who at first came to
Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about <a
href="#N61">a hundred pounds.</a>  <a name="C19V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:40</font></a> So they took Jesus' body, and
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to
bury.  <a name="C19V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:41</font></a> Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in
which no man had ever yet been laid.  <a name="C19V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:42</font></a> Then because of the Jews'
Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Now on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the
tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> Therefore she ran and came to
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them,
&quot;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know
where they have laid him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> Therefore Peter and
the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> They both ran together. The other
disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Stooping and looking in, he saw
the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> Then Simon Peter came, following
him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> and the cloth that had been on
his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by
itself.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> So then the other
disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and
believed.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> For as yet they
didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> So the disciples went away again
to their own homes.
<p> <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> But Mary was standing
outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into
the tomb,  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> and she saw
two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> They told her, &quot;Woman, why
are you weeping?&quot;
<p>She said to them, &quot;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
don't know where they have laid him.&quot;  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.
<p> <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking
for?&quot;
<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, &quot;Sir, if you
have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take
him away.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Mary.&quot;
<p>She turned and said to him, &quot;Rhabbouni!&quot; which is to say,
&quot;Teacher!&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> Jesus said to her,
&quot;Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my
Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father
and your Father, to my God and your God.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Mary Magdalene came
and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said
these things to her.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> When therefore it was evening,
on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked
where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst, and said to them, &quot;Peace be to
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> When he had said
this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were
glad when they saw the Lord.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> Jesus therefore said to them
again, &quot;Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me,
even so I send you.&quot;  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, &quot;Receive the Holy
Spirit!  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> Whoever's sins
you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have
been retained.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> But Thomas, one of
the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> The other disciples therefore
said to him, &quot;We have seen the Lord!&quot;
<p>But he said to them, &quot;Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> After eight days
again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the
doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, &quot;Peace be to you.&quot;  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> Then he said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your
hand, and put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but
believing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> Thomas answered him,
&quot;My Lord and my God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Because you have seen me,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N62">*</a></sup></font> you have believed. Blessed
are those who have not seen, and have believed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> Therefore Jesus did
many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
in this book;  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> but these
are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> After these things,
Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He
revealed himself this way.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Simon Peter, Thomas called
Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
others of his disciples were together.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Simon Peter said to them,
&quot;I'm going fishing.&quot;
<p>They told him, &quot;We are also coming with you.&quot; They
immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught
nothing.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> But when day had
already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that
it was Jesus.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> Jesus
therefore said to them, &quot;Children, have you anything
to eat?&quot;
<p>They answered him, &quot;No.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will
find some.&quot;
<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the
multitude of fish.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> That
disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &quot;It's the
Lord!&quot;
<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> But the other disciples came in
the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about <a
href="#N63">two hundred cubits</a> away), dragging the net full of fish.
 <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> So when they got out on
the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
 <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Bring some of the fish which you have just
caught.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> Simon Peter went up,
and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and
even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.
<p> <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Come and eat breakfast.&quot;
<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
knowing that it was the Lord.
<p> <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> Then Jesus came and
took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> This is now the third time that
Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
 <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> So when they had eaten
their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &quot;Simon,
son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for
you.&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Feed my lambs.&quot;
 <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> He said to him again a
second time, &quot;Simon, son of Jonah, do you love
me?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for
you.&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Tend my sheep.&quot;
 <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> He said to him the third
time, &quot;Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for
me?&quot;
<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, &quot;Do you have affection for me?&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for
you.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to him, &quot;Feed my sheep.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, when
you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But
when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress
you, and carry you where you don't want to go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> Now he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said
this, he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> Then Peter, turning
around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus
sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the
supper and asked, &quot;Lord, who is going to betray You?&quot;  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Peter seeing him, said to Jesus,
&quot;Lord, what about this man?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that
to you? You follow me.&quot;  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> This saying therefore went out
among the <a href="#N64">brothers</a>, that this disciple wouldn't die.
Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, &quot;If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you?&quot;  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> This
is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things.
We know that his witness is true.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> There are also many other things
which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even
the world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.

<p>This file should be named web4310h.htm or web4310h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web4310ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
