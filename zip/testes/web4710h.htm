<h1>
Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of
God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of
Achaia:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Grace to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all
comfort;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> who comforts us
in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any
affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by
God.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> For as the sufferings
of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> But if we are afflicted,
it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your
comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Our
hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the
sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> For we don't desire to have you
uninformed, <a href="#N1">brothers,</a> concerning our affliction which
happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our
power, so much that we despaired even of life.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Yes, we ourselves have had the
sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,
but in God who raises the dead,  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> who delivered us out of so great
a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also
still deliver us;  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> you
also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the
gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons
on your behalf.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> For our
boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and
sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved
ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> For we write no other things to
you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will
acknowledge to the end;  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> as also you acknowledged us in
part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of
our Lord Jesus.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> In this
confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a
second benefit;  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> and by
you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and
to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> When I therefore was thus
determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I
purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the
&quot;Yes, yes&quot; and the &quot;No, no?&quot;  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> But as God is faithful, our word
toward you was not &quot;Yes and no.&quot;  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ,
who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not
&quot;Yes and no,&quot; but in him is &quot;Yes.&quot;  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> For however many are the promises
of God, in him is the &quot;Yes.&quot; Therefore also through him is the
&quot;Amen,&quot; to the glory of God through us.
<p> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Now he who establishes
us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> who also sealed us, and gave us
the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> But I call God for a witness to
my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Not that we have lordship over
your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand
firm in faith.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> But I determined this
for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> For if I make you sorry, then who
will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> And I wrote this very thing to
you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I
ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be
shared by all of you.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> For
out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many
tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love
that I have so abundantly for you.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> But if any has caused sorrow, he
has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily)
to you all.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Sufficient to
such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> so that on the contrary you should
rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be
swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Therefore I beg you to confirm
your love toward him.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> For
to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you
are obedient in all things.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Now I also forgive whomever you
forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven
that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> that no advantage may be gained
over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Now when I came to
Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the
Lord,  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> I had no relief for
my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of
them, I went out into Macedonia.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Now thanks be to God, who always
leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of
his knowledge in every place.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> For we are a sweet aroma of
Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> to the one a stench from death to
death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for
these things?  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> For we are
not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of
God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Are we beginning again
to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation
to you or from you?  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> You
are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> being revealed that you are a
letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit
of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts
of flesh.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Such confidence
we have through Christ toward God;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> not that we are sufficient of
ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is
from God;  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> who also made us
sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the
Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> But if the service of death,
written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of
Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of
his face; which was passing away:  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> won't service of the Spirit be
with much more glory?  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> For
if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness
exceeds much more in glory.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> For most certainly that which has
been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason
of the glory that surpasses.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> For if that which passes away was
with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Having therefore such
a hope, we use great boldness of speech,  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> and not as Moses, who put a veil
on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the
end of that which was passing away.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But their minds were hardened,
for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil
remains, because in Christ it passes away.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> But to this day, when Moses is
read, a veil lies on their heart.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> But whenever one turns to the
Lord, the veil is taken away.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Now the Lord is the Spirit and
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> But we all, with unveiled face
beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the
same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Therefore seeing we
have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> But we have renounced the hidden
things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to
every man's conscience in the sight of God.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Even if our Good News is veiled,
it is veiled in those who perish;  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> in whom the god of this world has
blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of
the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.
 <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> For we don't preach
ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for
Jesus' sake;  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> seeing it is
God who said, &quot;Light will shine out of darkness,&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font> who has
shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God in the face of Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But we have this
treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be
of God, and not from ourselves.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> We are pressed on every side, yet
not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> pursued, yet not forsaken; struck
down, yet not destroyed;  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> always carrying in the body the
putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be
revealed in our body.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> For
we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life
also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> So then death works in us, but
life in you.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> But having
the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, &quot;I
believed, and therefore I spoke.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font> We also believe, and
therefore also we speak;  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> knowing that he who raised the
Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
 <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For all things are for
your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause
the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Therefore we don't faint, but
though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by
day.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> For our light
affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more
exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> while we don't look at the things
which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which
are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> For we know that if the
earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a
house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> For most certainly in this we
groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;
 <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> if so be that being
clothed we will not be found naked.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> For indeed we who are in this tent
do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we
desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
 <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Now he who made us for
this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Therefore, we are
always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are
absent from the Lord;  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> for
we walk by faith, not by sight.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> We are of good courage, I say, and
are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the
Lord.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Therefore also we
make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.
 <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> For we must all be
revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the
things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
 <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Knowing therefore the
fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope
that we are revealed also in your consciences.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> For we are not commending
ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on
our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in
appearance, and not in heart.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> For if we are beside ourselves,
it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> For the love of Christ constrains
us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.
 <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> He died for all, that
those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for
their sakes died and rose again.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Therefore we know no one after
the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet now we know him so no more.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Therefore if anyone is in Christ,
he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things
have become new.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> But all
things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and
gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> namely, that God was in Christ
reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses,
and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> We are therefore ambassadors on
behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us. We beg you on
behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> For him who knew no sin he made
to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness
of God.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Working together, we
entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> for he says,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;At an acceptable time I listened to you,
<dt>in a day of salvation I helped you.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of
salvation.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> We give no
occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> but in everything
commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in
afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> in beatings, in imprisonments, in
riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> in pureness, in knowledge, in
patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> in the word of truth, in the power
of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
 <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> by glory and dishonor, by
evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> as unknown, and yet well known; as
dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> as sorrowful, yet always
rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
possessing all things.
<p> <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Our mouth is open to
you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> You are not restricted by us, but
you are restricted by your own affections.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Now in return, I speak as to my
children, you also be open wide.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Don't be unequally yoked with
unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what
fellowship has light with darkness?  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> What agreement has Christ with
Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> What agreement has a temple of
God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said,
&quot;I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
they will be my people.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> Therefore,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;'Come out from among them,
<dd>and be separate,' says the Lord.
<dt>'Touch no unclean thing.
<dd>I will receive you.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
<dt> <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> I will be to you a
Father.
<dd>You will be to me sons and daughters,'
</dl>
<p>says the Lord Almighty.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Having therefore these
promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh
and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Open your hearts to us. We wronged
no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> I say this not to condemn you, for
I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live
together.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Great is my
boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am
filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> For even when we had come into
Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side.
Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Nevertheless, he who comforts the
lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> and not by his coming only, but
also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us
of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced
still more.
<p> <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> For though I made you
sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I
see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> I now rejoice, not that you were
made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made
sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> For godly sorrow works repentance
to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works
death.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> For behold, this
same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it
worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and
vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the
matter.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> So although I
wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his
cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be
revealed in you in the sight of God.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Therefore we have been comforted.
In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus,
because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> For if in anything I have boasted
to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things
to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found
to be truth.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> His
affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your
obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> I rejoice that in everything I am
of good courage concerning you.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Moreover, brothers, we
make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies
of Macedonia;  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> how that in
much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty
abounded to the riches of their liberality.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> For according to their power, I
testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
 <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> begging us with much
entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the
saints.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> This was not as we
had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us
through the will of God.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> So we urged Titus, that as he made
a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> But as you abound in everything,
in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us,
see that you also abound in this grace.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> I speak not by way of commandment,
but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of
your love.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> For you know
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your
sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.
 <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> I give a judgment in
this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year
ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> But now complete the doing also,
that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the
completion also out of your ability.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> For if the readiness is there, it
is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't
have.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> For this is not
that others may be eased and you distressed,  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> but for equality. Your abundance
at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may
become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> As it is written, &quot;He who
gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no
lack.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> But thanks be to God,
who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> For he indeed accepted our
exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own
accord.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> We have sent
together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known
through all the assemblies.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> Not only so, but who was also
appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is
served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.
 <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> We are avoiding this,
that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is
administered by us.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Having regard for honorable
things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
 <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> We have sent with them
our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but
now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in
you.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> As for Titus, he is
my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the
apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Therefore show the proof of your
love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your
behalf.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> It is indeed
unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,
 <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> for I know your readiness,
of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been
prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
 <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> But I have sent the
brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this
respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> so that I won't by any means, if
there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say
nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> I thought it necessary therefore
to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange
ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same
might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Remember this: he who sows
sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap
bountifully.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Let each man
give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under
compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> And God is able to make all grace
abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may
abound to every good work.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> As it is written,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor.
<dd>His righteousness remains forever.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N9">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> Now may he who
supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your
seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> you being enriched in everything
to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> For this service of giving that
you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also
through many givings of thanks to God;  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> seeing that through the proof
given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your
confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your
contribution to them and to all;  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> while they themselves also, with
supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding
grace of God in you.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Now
thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now I Paul, myself,
entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your
presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward
you.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Yes, I beg you that
I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I
intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to
the flesh.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> For though we
walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> for the weapons of our warfare
are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of
strongholds,  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> throwing
down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the
knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the
obedience of Christ;  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> and
being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be
made full.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Do you look at
things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in
himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself,
that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> For though I should boast
somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for
building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,
 <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> that I may not seem as if
I desire to terrify you by my letters.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> For, &quot;His letters,&quot;
they say, &quot;are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak,
and his speech is despised.&quot;  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Let such a person consider this,
that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also
in deed when we are present.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> For we are not bold to number or
compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they
themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
with themselves, are without understanding.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> But we will not boast beyond
proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us,
which reach even to you.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> For we don't stretch ourselves
too much, as though we didn't reach to you. For we came even as far as to
you with the Good News of Christ,  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> not boasting beyond proper
limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we
will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> so as to preach the Good News
even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has
already done.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> But
&quot;he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N10">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> For it isn't he who commends
himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> I wish that you would
bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.
 <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> For I am jealous over you
with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might
present you as a pure virgin to Christ.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> But I am afraid that somehow, as
the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be
corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> For if he who comes preaches
another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different
spirit, which you did not receive, or a different &quot;good news&quot;,
which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> For I reckon that I am not at all
behind the very best apostles.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> But though I am unskilled in
speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been
revealed to you in all things.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Or did I commit a sin in humbling
myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good
News free of charge?  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> I
robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.
 <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> When I was present with
you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when
they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I
kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.
 <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> As the truth of Christ
is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
 <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Why? Because I don't
love you? God knows.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> But
what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that
desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as
we.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> For such men are
false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.
 <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> And no wonder, for even
Satan masquerades as an angel of light.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> It is no great thing therefore
if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end
will be according to their works.
<p> <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> I say again, let no
one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also
may boast a little.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> That
which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness,
in this confidence of boasting.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Seeing that many boast after the
flesh, I will also boast.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> For you bear with the foolish
gladly, being wise.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> For
you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if
he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.
 <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> I speak by way of
disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I
speak in foolishness), I am bold also.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are
they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> Are they servants of Christ? (I
speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in
prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.
 <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Five times from the Jews
I received forty stripes minus one.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Three times I was beaten with
rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a
night and a day in the deep.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> I have been in travels often,
perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils
from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in
the sea, perils among false brothers;  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> in labor and travail, in
watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and
nakedness.
<p> <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> Besides those things
that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all
the assemblies.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Who is
weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with
indignation?  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> If I must
boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> The God and Father of the Lord
Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.
 <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> In Damascus the governor
under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to
arrest me.  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> Through a
window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> It is doubtless not
profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of
the Lord.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> I know a man in
Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether
out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the
third heaven.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> I know such
a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God
knows),  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> how he was caught
up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for
a man to utter.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> On behalf
of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except
in my weaknesses.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> For if
I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the
truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which
he sees in me, or hears from me.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> By reason of the exceeding
greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively,
there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to
torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> Concerning this thing, I begged
the Lord three times that it might depart from me.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
perfect in weakness.&quot; Most gladly therefore I will rather
glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.
<p> <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Therefore I take
pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in
distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
 <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> I have become foolish in
boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for
in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.
 <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Truly the signs of an
apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and
mighty works.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> For what
is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies,
unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.
<p> <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> Behold, this is the
third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you;
for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to
save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> I will most gladly spend and be
spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
 <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> But be it so, I did not
myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> Did I take advantage of you by
anyone of them whom I have sent to you?  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the
brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn't we walk in
the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps?  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> Again, do you think that we are
excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all
things, beloved, are for your edifying.  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> For I am afraid that by any
means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I
might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would
be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings,
proud thoughts, riots;  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> that again when I come my God
would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have
sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual
immorality and lustfulness which they committed.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> This is the third time
I am coming to you. &quot;At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall

say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being
absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest,
that, if I come again, I will not spare;  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> seeing that you seek a proof of
Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in
you.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> For he was crucified
through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are
weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward
you.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Test your own
selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don't you
know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed
you are disqualified.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> But
I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.
<p> <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Now I pray to God that
you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that
which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> For we can do nothing against the
truth, but for the truth.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> For we rejoice when we are weak
and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
 <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> For this cause I write
these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present,
according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not
for tearing down.
<p> <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Finally, brothers,
rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace,
and the God of love and peace will be with you.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Greet one another with a holy
kiss.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> All the saints
greet you.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> The grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy
Spirit, be with you all. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web4710h.htm or web4710h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web4710ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are<br>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
