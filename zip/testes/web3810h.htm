<h1>
Zechariah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> In the eighth month, in
the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of
Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;Yahweh was very displeased
with your fathers.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Therefore tell them: Thus says
Yahweh of Armies: 'Return to me,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'and I will
return to you,' says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Don't you be like your fathers, to
whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Thus says Yahweh of Armies,
'Return now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings;' but they did
not hear, nor listen to me, says Yahweh.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Your fathers, where are they? And
the prophets, do they live forever?  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> But my words and my decrees, which
I commanded my servants the prophets, didn't they overtake your fathers?
<p>&quot;Then they repented and said, 'Just as Yahweh of Armies determined
to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so he
has dealt with us.'&quot;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> On the twenty-fourth day of the
eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius,
the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of
Iddo, the prophet, saying,  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> &quot;I had a vision in the night,
and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle
trees that were in a ravine; and behind him there were red, brown, and
white horses.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Then I
asked, 'My lord, what are these?'&quot;
<p>The angel who talked with me said to me, &quot;I will show you what
these are.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> The man who stood
among the myrtle trees answered, &quot;They are the ones Yahweh has sent
to go back and forth through the earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> They reported to the
angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, &quot;We have
walked back and forth through the earth, and behold, all the earth is at
rest and in peace.&quot;<br>
 <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Then the angel of Yahweh
replied, &quot;O Yahweh of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on
Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had
indignation these seventy years?&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Yahweh answered the
angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> So the angel who talked with me
said to me, &quot;Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies: &quot;I
am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> I am very angry with the nations
that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the
calamity.&quot;  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Therefore
thus says Yahweh: &quot;I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house
shall be built in it,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and a line shall
be stretched forth over Jerusalem.&quot;'
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> &quot;Proclaim
further, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies: &quot;My cities will again
overflow with prosperity, and Yahweh will again comfort Zion, and will
again choose Jerusalem.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> I lifted up my eyes,
and saw, and behold, four horns.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> I asked the angel who talked with
me, &quot;What are these?&quot;
<p>He answered me, &quot;These are the horns which have scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Yahweh showed me four
craftsmen.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Then I asked,
&quot;What are these coming to do?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no
man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down
the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of
Judah to scatter it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> I lifted up my eyes,
and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Then I asked, &quot;Where are you
going?&quot;
<p>He said to me, &quot;To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth
and what is its length.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Behold, the angel who
talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> and said to him, &quot;Run, speak
to this young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages
without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.
 <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For I,' says Yahweh, 'will
be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the midst
of her.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Come! Come! Flee
from the land of the north,' says Yahweh; 'for I have spread you abroad as
the four winds of the sky,' says Yahweh.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> 'Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell
with the daughter of Babylon.'  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of Armies:
'For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who
touches you touches the apple of his eye.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> For, behold, I will shake my hand
over them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them; and you will
know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Sing and rejoice, daughter of
Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you,' says
Yahweh.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Many nations
shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I
will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies
has sent me to you.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Yahweh will inherit Judah as his
portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Be silent, all flesh, before
Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> He showed me Joshua the
high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his
right hand to be his adversary.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan, &quot;Yahweh
rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn't
this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Now Joshua was clothed
with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> He answered and spoke to those who
stood before him, saying, &quot;Take the filthy garments off of him.&quot;
To him he said, &quot;Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from
you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> I said, &quot;Let them
set a clean turban on his head.&quot;
<p>So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the angel
of Yahweh was standing by.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> The angel of Yahweh protested to
Joshua, saying,  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> &quot;Thus
says Yahweh of Armies: 'If you will walk in my ways, and if you will
follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also
keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who
stand by.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Hear now, Joshua
the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men
who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> For, behold, the stone
that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will
engrave its engraving,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'and I will remove the
iniquity of that land in one day.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> In that day,' says Yahweh of
Armies, 'you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under
the fig tree.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> The angel who talked
with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his
sleep.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> He said to me,
&quot;What do you see?&quot;
<p>I said, &quot;I have seen, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with
its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven
pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> and two olive trees by it, one on
the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> I answered and spoke to
the angel who talked with me, saying, &quot;What are these, my lord?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Then the angel who
talked with me answered me, &quot;Don't you know what these are?&quot;
<p>I said, &quot;No, my lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Then he answered and
spoke to me, saying, &quot;This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel,
saying, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says Yahweh of
Armies.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Who are you, great
mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the
capstone with shouts of 'Grace, grace, to it!'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Moreover the word of
Yahweh came to me, saying,  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> &quot;The hands of Zerubbabel have
laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you
will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Indeed, who despises the day of
small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line
in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the eyes of Yahweh, which run back
and forth through the whole earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Then I asked him,
&quot;What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand
and on the left side of it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> I asked him the second
time, &quot;What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two
golden spouts, that pour the golden oil out of themselves?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> He answered me,
&quot;Don't you know what these are?&quot;
<p>I said, &quot;No, my lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Then he said,
&quot;These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole
earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Then again I lifted up
my eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying scroll.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> He said to me, &quot;What do you
see?&quot;
<p>I answered, &quot;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,
and its breadth ten cubits.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Then he said to me,
&quot;This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land;
for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side;
and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the
other side.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> I will cause
it to go out,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and it will enter into
the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my
name; and it will remain in the midst of his house, and will destroy it
with its timber and its stones.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Then the angel who
talked with me came forward, and said to me, &quot;Lift up now your eyes,
and see what is this that is appearing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> I said, &quot;What is
it?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;This is the <a href="#N1">ephah</a> basket that is
appearing.&quot; He said moreover, &quot;This is their appearance in all
the land  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> (and behold, a <a
href="#N2">talent</a> of lead was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting
in the midst of the ephah basket.&quot;  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> He said, &quot;This is
Wickedness;&quot; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah
basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth.
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Then lifted I up my
eyes, and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their
wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up
the ephah basket between earth and the sky.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Then said I to the angel who
talked with me, &quot;Where are these carrying the ephah basket?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> He said to me,
&quot;To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she
will be set there in her own place.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Again I lifted up my
eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two
mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> In the first chariot were red
horses; in the second chariot black horses;  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> in the third chariot white horses;
and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Then I asked the angel who talked
with me, &quot;What are these, my lord?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> The angel answered me,
&quot;These are the four winds of the sky, which go forth from standing
before the Lord of all the earth.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> The one with the black horses goes
out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the
dappled went forth toward the south country.&quot;  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> The strong went out, and sought to
go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said,
&quot;Go around and through the earth!&quot; So they walked back and forth
through the earth.
<p> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Then he called to me,
and spoke to me, saying, &quot;Behold, those who go toward the north
country have quieted my spirit in the north country.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> The word of Yahweh came
to me, saying,  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> &quot;Take
of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and
come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah,
where they have come from Babylon.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Yes, take silver and gold, and
make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the
high priest;  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> and speak to
him, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;Behold, the man whose name
is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build
the temple of Yahweh;  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> even he shall build the temple of
Yahweh; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne;
and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be
between them both.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> The
crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the
son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Those who are far off shall come
and build in the temple of Yahweh; and you shall know that Yahweh of
Armies has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey
the voice of Yahweh your God.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> It happened in the
fourth year of king Darius that the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah in
the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> The people of Bethel sent Sharezer
and Regem Melech, and their men, to entreat Yahweh's favor,  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> and to speak to the priests of the
house of Yahweh of Armies, and to the prophets, saying, &quot;Should I
weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many
years?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Then the word of Yahweh
of Armies came to me, saying,  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> &quot;Speak to all the people of
the land, and to the priests, saying, 'When you fasted and mourned in the
fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years, did you at all
fast to me, really to me?  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> When you eat, and when you drink,
don't you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Aren't these the words which
Yahweh proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and
in prosperity, and its cities around her, and the South and the lowland
were inhabited?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> The word of Yahweh came
to Zechariah, saying,  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> &quot;Thus has Yahweh of Armies
spoken, saying, 'Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion
every man to his brother.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Don't oppress the widow, nor the
fatherless, the foreigner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil
against his brother in your heart.'  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> But they refused to listen, and
turned their backs, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Yes, they made their
hearts as hard as flint, lest they might hear the law, and the words which
Yahweh of Armies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore
great wrath came from Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> It has come to pass that, as he
called, and they refused to listen, so they will call, and I will not
listen,&quot; said Yahweh of Armies;  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> &quot;but I will scatter them
with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the
land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned:
for they made the pleasant land desolate.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh of
Armies came to me.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh of Armies: &quot;I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy,
and I am jealous for her with great wrath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Thus says Yahweh:
&quot;I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.
Jerusalem shall be called 'The City of Truth;' and the mountain of Yahweh
of Armies, 'The Holy Mountain.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: &quot;Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of
Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> The streets of the city will be
full of boys and girls playing in its streets.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: &quot;If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people
in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?&quot; says Yahweh
of Armies.
<p> <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: &quot;Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and
from the west country;  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> and
I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they
will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in
righteousness.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: &quot;Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these
words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the
foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even the temple,
that it might be built.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> For before those days there was
no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace
to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all
men everyone against his neighbor.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> But now I will not be to the
remnant of this people as in the former days,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
 <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> &quot;For the seed of
peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its
increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the
remnant of this people to inherit all these things.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> It shall come to pass that, as
you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so
will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don't be afraid. Let your
hands be strong.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> For thus says Yahweh
of Armies: &quot;As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers
provoked me to wrath,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;and I didn't
repent;  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> so again have I
thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
Don't be afraid.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> These
are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his
neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates,  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> and let none of you devise evil
in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these
are things that I hate,&quot; says Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> The word of Yahweh of
Armies came to me.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh of Armies: &quot;The fasts of the fourth fifth, seventh, and
tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness, and
cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: &quot;Many peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will yet
come;  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> and the inhabitants
of one shall go to another, saying, 'Let us go speedily to entreat the
favor of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh of Armies. I will go also.'  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Yes, many peoples and strong
nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat
the favor of Yahweh.&quot;  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies:
&quot;In those days, ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of
the nations, they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying,
'We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> An oracle.
<dl>
<dt>The word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach,
<dd>and will rest upon Damascus;
<dt>for the eye of man
<dd>and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;
<dt> <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> and Hamath, also,
which borders on it;
<dd>Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
<dt> <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Tyre built herself a
stronghold,

<dt> <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Ashkelon will see it,
and fear;
<dd>Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;
<dd>as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;
<dd>and the king will perish from Gaza,
<dd>and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
<dt> <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Foreigners will dwell
in Ashdod,

blood out of his mouth,

<dd>and he will be as a chieftain in Judah,
<dd>and Ekron as a Jebusite.
<dt> <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> I will encamp around
my house against the army,
<dd>that none pass through or return;

<dd>for now I have seen with my eyes.
<dt> <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Rejoice greatly,
daughter of Zion!
<dd>Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!
<dt>Behold, your king comes to you!

<dd>lowly, and riding on a donkey,
<dd>even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
<dt> <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> I will cut off the
chariot from Ephraim,
<dd>and the horse from Jerusalem;
<dt>and the battle bow will be cut off;
<dd>and he will speak peace to the nations:
<dd>and his dominion will be from sea to sea,
<dd>and from the River to the ends of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> As for you also,
<dd>because of the blood of your covenant,
<dd>I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.
<dt> <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Turn to the
stronghold, you prisoners of hope!
<dd>Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.
<dt> <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> For indeed I bend
Judah as a bow for me.
<dd>I have filled the bow with Ephraim;
<dt>and I will stir up your sons, Zion,
<dd>against your sons, Greece,
<dd>and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
<dt> <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Yahweh will be seen
over them;
<dd>and his arrow will go flash like lightning;
<dd>and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,
<dd>and will go with whirlwinds of the south.

defend them;
<dd>and they will destroy and overcome with sling stones;

<dd>like the corners of the altar.
<dt> <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> Yahweh their God will
save them in that day as the flock of his people;

goodness,

<dd>Yahweh who makes storm clouds,

</dl>
<p> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Thus says Yahweh my
God: &quot;Feed the flock of slaughter.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Their buyers slaughter them, and
go unpunished. Those who sell them say, 'Blessed be Yahweh, for I am
rich;' and their own shepherds don't pity them.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> For I will no more pity the
inhabitants of the land,&quot; says Yahweh; &quot;but, behold, I will
deliver the men everyone into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of
his king. They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not
deliver them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> So I fed the flock of
slaughter, especially the oppressed of the flock. I took for myself two
staffs. The one I called &quot;Favor,&quot; and the other I called
&quot;Union,&quot; and I fed the flock.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> I cut off the three shepherds in
one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
 <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Then I said, &quot;I will
not feed you. That which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut
off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat each other's
flesh.&quot;  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> I took my
staff Favor, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant that I had
made with all the peoples.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> It was broken in that day; and
thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was the word
of Yahweh.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> I said to
them, &quot;If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep
them.&quot; So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Yahweh said to me, &quot;Throw
it to the potter, the handsome price that I was valued at by them!&quot; I
took the thirty pieces of silver, and threw them to the potter, in the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Then I
cut apart my other staff, even Union, that I might break the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel.
<p> <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> Yahweh said to me,
&quot;Take for yourself yet again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
 <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> For, behold, I will
raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off,
neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken,
nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat sheep,
and will tear their hoofs in pieces.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> Woe to the worthless shepherd
who leaves the flock! The sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye.
His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye will be totally
blinded!&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> An oracle. The word of
Yahweh concerning Israel. Yahweh, who stretches out the heavens, and lays
the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him says:
 <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> &quot;Behold, I will make
Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples, and on Judah
also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> It will happen in that day, that
I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who
burden themselves with it will be severely wounded, and all the nations of
the earth will be gathered together against it.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> In that day,&quot; says Yahweh,
&quot;I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness;
and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse
of the peoples with blindness.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> The chieftains of Judah will say
in their heart, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of
Armies their God.'  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> In
that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among
wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they will devour all the
surrounding peoples, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will
yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> Yahweh also will save the tents
of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> In that day Yahweh will defend
the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He who is feeble among them at that day will
be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of
Yahweh before them.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> It
will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that
come against Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> I will pour on the house of
David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
supplication; and they will look to <a href="#N3">me</a> whom they have
pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and
will grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for his firstborn.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> In that day there will be a
great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the
valley of Megiddon.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> The
land will mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David
apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and
their wives apart;  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> the
family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of
the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> all the families who remain,
every family apart, and their wives apart.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> &quot;In that day
there will be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> It will come to pass in that day,
says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of
the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the
prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> It will happen that, when anyone
still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell
him, 'You must die, because you speak lies in the name of Yahweh;' and his
father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.
 <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> It will happen in that
day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he
prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> but he will say, 'I am no
prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant
from my youth.'  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> One will
say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will
answer, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'
<dl>
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> &quot;Awake, sword,
against my shepherd,
<dd>and against the man who is close to me,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
<dt>&quot;Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;
<dd>and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
<dt> <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> It shall happen that
in all the land,&quot; says Yahweh,
<dd>&quot;two parts in it will be cut off and die;
<dd>but the third will be left in it.
<dt> <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> I will bring the
third part into the fire,
<dd>and will refine them as silver is refined,
<dd>and will test them like gold is tested.
<dt>They will call on my name, and I will hear them.
<dd>I will say, 'It is my people;'
<dd>and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God.'&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Behold, a day of
Yahweh comes, when your spoil will be divided in your midst.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> For I will gather all nations
against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses
rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into
captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.
 <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Then Yahweh will go out
and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
 <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> His feet will stand in
that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east;
and the Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a
very great valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and
half of it toward the south.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> You shall flee by the valley of
my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes,
you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days
of Uzziah king of Judah. Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones
with you.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> It will happen
in that day, that there will not be light, cold, or frost.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> It will be a unique day which is
known to Yahweh; not day, and not night; but it will come to pass, that at
evening time there will be light.
<p> <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> It will happen in that
day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward
the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in
winter will it be.
<p> <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Yahweh will be King
over all the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and his name one.
 <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> All the land will be
made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will
be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the
place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel
to the king's winepresses.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Men will dwell therein, and
there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> This will be the plague with
which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have warred against
Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet,
and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will
consume away in their mouth.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> It will happen in that day, that
a great panic from Yahweh will be among them; and they will lay hold
everyone on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against
the hand of his neighbor.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Judah also will fight at
Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered
together: gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.
<p> <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> So will be the plague
of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the
animals that will be in those camps, as that plague.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> It will happen that everyone who
is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from
year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast
of tents.  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> It will be,
that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn't go up to Jerusalem
to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, on them there will be no rain.
 <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> If the family of Egypt
doesn't go up, and doesn't come, neither will it rain on them. This will
be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don't go up
to keep the feast of tents.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> This will be the punishment of
Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don't go up to keep the

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK<br>

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br>
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
