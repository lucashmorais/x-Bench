Proverbs
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The proverbs of Solomon,
the son of David, king of Israel:
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to know wisdom and
instruction;
<dd>to discern the words of understanding;
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> to receive instruction
in wise dealing,
<dd>in righteousness, justice, and equity;
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> to give prudence to
the simple,
<dd>knowledge and discretion to the young man:
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> that the wise man may
hear, and increase in learning;
<dd>that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> to understand a
proverb, and parables,
<dd>the words and riddles of the wise.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> The fear of Yahweh is
the beginning of knowledge;
<dd>but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> My son, listen to your
father's instruction,
<dd>and don't forsake your mother's teaching:
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> for they will be a
garland to grace your head,
<dd>and chains around your neck.
<dt> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> My son, if sinners
entice you, don't consent.
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> If they say,
&quot;Come with us,
<dd>Let's lay in wait for blood;
<dd>let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> let's swallow them up
alive like Sheol,
<dd>and whole, like those who go down into the pit.
<dt> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> We'll find all
valuable wealth.
<dd>We'll fill our houses with spoil.
<dt> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> You shall cast your
lot among us.
<dd>We'll all have one purse.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> My son, don't walk in
the way with them.
<dd>Keep your foot from their path,
<dt> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> for their feet run to
evil.
<dd>They hurry to shed blood.
<dt> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> For in vain is the
net spread in the sight of any bird:
<dt> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> but these lay wait
for their own blood.
<dd>They lurk secretly for their own lives.
<dt> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> So are the ways of
everyone who is greedy for gain.
<dd>It takes away the life of its owners.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Wisdom calls aloud in
the street.
<dd>She utters her voice in the public squares.
<dt> <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> She calls at the head
of noisy places.
<dd>At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
<dt> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> &quot;How long, you
simple ones, will you love simplicity?
<dd>How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
<dd>and fools hate knowledge?
<dt> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> Turn at my reproof.
<dd>Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
<dd>I will make known my words to you.
<dt> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Because I have
called, and you have refused;
<dd>I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
<dt> <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> but you have ignored
all my counsel,
<dd>and wanted none of my reproof;
<dt> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> I also will laugh at
your disaster.
<dd>I will mock when calamity overtakes you;
<dt> <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> when calamity
overtakes you like a storm,
<dd>when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;
<dd>when distress and anguish come on you.
<dt> <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> Then will they call
on me, but I will not answer.
<dd>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
<dt> <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> because they hated
knowledge,
<dd>and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> They wanted none of
my counsel.
<dd>They despised all my reproof.
<dt> <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> Therefore they will
eat of the fruit of their own way,
<dd>and be filled with their own schemes.
<dt> <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> For the backsliding
of the simple will kill them.
<dd>The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
<dt> <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> But whoever listens
to me will dwell securely,
<dd>and will be at ease, without fear of harm.&quot;
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> My son, if you will
receive my words,
<dd>and store up my commandments within you;
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> So as to turn your ear
to wisdom,
<dd>and apply your heart to understanding;
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Yes, if you call out
for discernment,
<dd>and lift up your voice for understanding;
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> If you seek her as
silver,
<dd>and search for her as for hidden treasures:
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> then you will
understand the fear of Yahweh,
<dd>and find the knowledge of God.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> For Yahweh gives
wisdom.
<dd>Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> He lays up sound
wisdom for the upright.
<dd>He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> that he may guard the
paths of justice,
<dd>and preserve the way of his saints.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Then you will
understand righteousness and justice,
<dd>equity and every good path.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For wisdom will enter
into your heart.
<dd>Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Discretion will watch
over you.
<dd>Understanding will keep you,
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> to deliver you from
the way of evil,
<dd>from the men who speak perverse things;
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> who forsake the paths
of uprightness,
<dd>to walk in the ways of darkness;
<dt> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> who rejoice to do
evil,
<dd>and delight in the perverseness of evil;
<dt> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> who are crooked in
their ways,
<dd>and wayward in their paths:
<dt> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> To deliver you from
the strange woman,
<dd>even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> who forsakes the
friend of her youth,
<dd>and forgets the covenant of her God:
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> for her house leads
down to death,
<dd>her paths to the dead.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> None who go to her
return again,
<dd>neither do they attain to the paths of life:
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> that you may walk in
the way of good men,
<dd>and keep the paths of the righteous.
<dt> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> For the upright will
dwell in the land.
<dd>The perfect will remain in it.
<dt> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> But the wicked will
be cut off from the land.
<dd>The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> My son, don't forget
my teaching;
<dd>but let your heart keep my commandments:
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> for length of days,
and years of life,
<dd>and peace, will they add to you.
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Don't let kindness and
truth forsake you.
<dd>Bind them around your neck.
<dd>Write them on the tablet of your heart.
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> So you will find favor,
<dd>and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Trust in Yahweh with
all your heart,
<dd>and don't lean on your own understanding.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> In all your ways
acknowledge him,
<dd>and he will make your paths straight.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Don't be wise in your
own eyes.
<dd>Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> It will be health to
your body,
<dd>and nourishment to your bones.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Honor Yahweh with your
substance,
<dd>with the first fruits of all your increase:
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> so your barns will be
filled with plenty,
<dd>and your vats will overflow with new wine.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> My son, don't despise
Yahweh's discipline,
<dd>neither be weary of his reproof:
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> for whom Yahweh
loves, he reproves;
<dd>even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Happy is the man who
finds wisdom,
<dd>the man who gets understanding.
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> For her good profit
is better than getting silver,
<dd>and her return is better than fine gold.
<dt> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> She is more precious
than rubies.
<dd>None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Length of days is in
her right hand.
<dd>In her left hand are riches and honor.
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Her ways are ways of
pleasantness.
<dd>All her paths are peace.
<dt> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> She is a tree of life
to those who lay hold of her.
<dd>Happy is everyone who retains her.
<dt> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> By wisdom Yahweh
founded the earth.
<dd>By understanding, he established the heavens.
<dt> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> By his knowledge, the
depths were broken up,
<dd>and the skies drop down the dew.
<dt> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> My son, let them not
depart from your eyes.
<dd>Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
<dt> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> so they will be life
to your soul,
<dd>and grace for your neck.
<dt> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Then you shall walk
in your way securely.
<dd>Your foot won't stumble.
<dt> <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> When you lie down,
you will not be afraid.
<dd>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
<dt> <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Don't be afraid of
sudden fear,
<dd>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:
<dt> <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> for Yahweh will be
your confidence,
<dd>and will keep your foot from being taken.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> Don't withhold good
from those to whom it is due,
<dd>when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
<dt> <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> Don't say to your
neighbor, &quot;Go, and come again;
<dd>tomorrow I will give it to you,&quot;
<dd>when you have it by you.
<dt> <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> Don't devise evil
against your neighbor,
<dd>seeing he dwells securely by you.
<dt> <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> Don't strive with a
man without cause,
<dd>if he has done you no harm.
<dt> <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> Don't envy the man of
violence.
<dd>Choose none of his ways.
<dt> <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> For the perverse is
an abomination to Yahweh,
<dd>but his friendship is with the upright.
<dt> <a name="C3V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:33</font></a> Yahweh's curse is in
the house of the wicked,
<dd>but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
<dt> <a name="C3V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:34</font></a> Surely he mocks the
mockers,
<dd>but he gives grace to the humble.
<dt> <a name="C3V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:35</font></a> The wise will inherit
glory,
<dd>but shame will be the promotion of fools.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Listen, sons, to a
father's instruction.
<dd>Pay attention and know understanding;
<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> for I give you sound
learning.
<dd>Don't forsake my law.
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For I was a son to my
father,
<dd>tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> He taught me, and said
to me:
<dd>&quot;Let your heart retain my words.

<dt> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Wisdom is supreme.
<dd>Get wisdom.
<dd>Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Esteem her, and she
will exalt you.
<dd>She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.
<dt> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> She will give to your
head a garland of grace.
<dd>She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.&quot;

the way of wisdom.

steps will not be hampered.

instruction.
<dd>Don't let her go.
<dd>Keep her, for she is your life.

path of the wicked.
<dd>Don't walk in the way of evil men.

pass by it.
<dd>Turn from it, and pass on.
<dt> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> For they don't sleep,
unless they do evil.
<dd>Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.
<dt> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> For they eat the
bread of wickedness,
<dd>and drink the wine of violence.
<dt> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> But the path of the
righteous is like the dawning light,
<dd>that shines more and more until the perfect day.
<dt> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> The way of the wicked
is like darkness.

words.

from your eyes.
<dd>Keep them in the midst of your heart.
<dt> <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> For they are life to
those who find them,

all diligence,
<dd>for out of it is the wellspring of life.

yourself a perverse mouth.

straight ahead.

discretion,

as bitter as wormwood,

death.

three things which are stately in their march,

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>

ways.</p>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
