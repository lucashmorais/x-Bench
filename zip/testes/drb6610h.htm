<h1>Book 66 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James</h1>
<br><br>




<p>THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE</p>

<p>This Epistle is called Catholic or Universal, as formerly were also the<br>
two Epistles of St. Peter, the first of St. John and that of St. Jude,<br>
because they were not written to any peculiar people or particular<br>
person, but to the faithful in general. It was written by the apostle<br>
St. James, called the Less, who was also called the brother of our Lord,<br>
being his kinsman (for cousins german with the Hebrews were called<br>
brothers). He was the first Bishop of Jerusalem. In this Epistle are set<br>
forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals; particularly, that<br>
faith without good works will not save a man and that true wisdom is<br>
given only from above. In the fifth chapter he publishes the sacrament<br>
of anointing the sick. It was written a short time before his martyrdom,<br>
about twenty-eight years after our Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
James Chapter 1</p>

<p>The benefit of tribulations. Prayer with faith. God is the author of all<br>
good, but not of evil. We must be slow to anger and not hearers only,<br>
but doers of the word. Of bridling the tongue and of pure religion.</p>

<p>1:1. James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the<br>
twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>

<p>1:2. My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers<br>
temptations:</p>

<p>Into divers temptations... The word temptation, in this epistle, is<br>
sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions, as in this<br>
place: at other times, it is to be understood, tempting, enticing, or<br>
drawing others into sin.</p>

<p>1:3. Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience</p>

<p>1:4. And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and<br>
entire, failing in nothing.</p>

<p>1:5. But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all<br>
men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.</p>

<p>1:6. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is<br>
like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</p>

<p>1:7. Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>1:8. A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</p>

<p>1:9. But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</p>

<p>1:10. And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass<br>
shall he pass away.</p>

<p>1:11. For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and<br>
the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof<br>
perished. So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>

<p>1:12. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath<br>
been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised<br>
to them that love him.</p>

<p>1:13. Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For<br>
God is not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.</p>

<p>1:14. But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn<br>
away and allured.</p>

<p>1:15. Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.<br>
But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</p>

<p>1:16. Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</p>

<p>1:17. Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down<br>
from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of<br>
alteration.</p>

<p>1:18. For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that<br>
we might be some beginning of his creature.</p>

<p>Some beginning... That is, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</p>

<p>1:19. You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear,<br>
but slow to speak and slow to anger.</p>

<p>1:20. For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</p>

<p>1:21. Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of<br>
naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to<br>
save your souls.</p>

<p>1:22. But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your<br>
own selves.</p>

<p>1:23. For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be<br>
compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</p>

<p>1:24. For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what<br>
manner of man he was.</p>

<p>1:25. But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath<br>
continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the<br>
work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>

<p>1:26. And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his<br>
tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</p>

<p>1:27. Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to<br>
visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one's<br>
self unspotted from this world.</p>

<p>James Chapter 2</p>

<p>Against respect of persons. The danger of transgressing one point of the<br>
law. Faith is dead without works.</p>

<p>2:1. My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory,<br>
with respect of persons.</p>

<p>With respect of persons... The meaning is, that in matters relating to<br>
faith, the administering of the sacraments, and other spiritual<br>
functions in God's church, there should be no respect of persons; but<br>
that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the<br>
rich. See Deut. 1.17.</p>

<p>2:2. For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden<br>
ring, in fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean<br>
attire:</p>

<p>2:3. And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel<br>
and shall say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand<br>
thou there, or: Sit under my footstool:</p>

<p>2:4. Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust<br>
thoughts?</p>

<p>2:5. Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this<br>
world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to<br>
them that love him?</p>

<p>2:6. But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you<br>
by might? And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</p>

<p>2:7. Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</p>

<p>2:8. If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou<br>
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</p>

<p>2:9. But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved<br>
by the law as transgressors.</p>

<p>2:10. And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point,<br>
is become guilty of all.</p>

<p>Guilty of all... That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such a<br>
manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him to<br>
salvation; for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great<br>
and general commandment of charity, even by one mortal sin. For all the<br>
precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law,<br>
and as it were a chain of precepts, where, by breaking one link of this<br>
chain, the whole chain is broken, or the integrity of the law consisting<br>
of a collection of precepts. A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence<br>
against any one precept, incurs eternal punishment; yet the punishment<br>
in hell shall be greater for those who have been greater sinners, as a<br>
greater reward shall be for those in heaven who have lived with greater<br>
sanctity and perfection.</p>

<p>2:11. For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou<br>
shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou<br>
art become a transgressor of the law.</p>

<p>2:12. So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of<br>
liberty.</p>

<p>2:13. For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. &nbsp;And<br>
mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</p>

<p>2:14. What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but<br>
hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</p>

<p>2:15. And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:</p>

<p>2:16. And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled;<br>
yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what<br>
shall it profit?</p>

<p>2:17. So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</p>

<p>2:18. But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. &nbsp;Shew me<br>
thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</p>

<p>2:19. Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils<br>
also believe and tremble.</p>

<p>2:20. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>

<p>2:21. Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac<br>
his son upon the altar?</p>

<p>2:22. Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works<br>
faith was made perfect?</p>

<p>2:23. And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and<br>
it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</p>

<p>2:24. Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith<br>
only?</p>

<p>2:25. And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by<br>
works, receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?</p>

<p>2:26. For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith<br>
without works is dead.</p>

<p>James Chapter 3</p>

<p>Of the evils of the tongue. Of the difference between the earthly and<br>
heavenly wisdom.</p>

<p>3:1. Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the<br>
greater judgment.</p>

<p>3:2. For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word,<br>
the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about<br>
the whole body.</p>

<p>3:3. For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey<br>
us: and we turn about their whole body.</p>

<p>3:4. Behold also ships, whereas they are great and are driven by strong<br>
winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the<br>
force of the governor willeth.</p>

<p>3:5. Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great<br>
things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.</p>

<p>3:6. And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed<br>
among our members, which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel<br>
of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.</p>

<p>3:7. For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the<br>
rest is tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.</p>

<p>3:8. But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly<br>
poison.</p>

<p>3:9. By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men who are<br>
made after the likeness of God.</p>

<p>3:10. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My<br>
brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>

<p>3:11. Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter<br>
water?</p>

<p>3:12. Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes? Or the vine, figs? So<br>
neither can the salt water yield sweet.</p>

<p>3:13. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, among you? Let him<br>
shew, by a good contestation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.</p>

<p>3:14. But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contention in your<br>
hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth.</p>

<p>3:15. For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly,<br>
sensual, devilish.</p>

<p>3:16. For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and<br>
every evil work.</p>

<p>3:17. But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then<br>
peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of<br>
mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.</p>

<p>3:18. And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make<br>
peace.</p>

<p>James Chapter 4</p>

<p>The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends to<br>
this world. Admonitions against pride, detraction and the like.</p>

<p>4:1. From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence,<br>
from your concupiscences, which war in your members?</p>

<p>4:2. You covet, and have not: you kill and envy and cannot obtain. &nbsp;You<br>
contend and war, and you have not: because you ask not.</p>

<p>4:3. You ask and receive not: because you ask amiss, that you may<br>
consume it on your concupiscences.</p>

<p>4:4. Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the<br>
enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world<br>
becometh an enemy of God.</p>

<p>4:5. Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the<br>
spirit covet which dwelleth in you?</p>

<p>4:6. But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the<br>
proud and giveth grace to the humble.</p>

<p>4:7. Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil: and he will fly<br>
from you.</p>

<p>4:8. Draw nigh to God: and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands,<br>
ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>

<p>4:9. Be afflicted and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into<br>
mourning and your joy into sorrow.</p>

<p>4:10. Be humbled in the sight of the Lord: and he will exalt you.</p>

<p>4:11. Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his<br>
brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law and judgeth<br>
the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but<br>
a judge.</p>

<p>4:12. There is one lawgiver and judge, that is able to destroy and to<br>
deliver.</p>

<p>4:13. But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that<br>
say: To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will<br>
spend a year and will traffic and make our gain.</p>

<p>4:14. Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.</p>

<p>4:15. For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little<br>
while and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the<br>
Lord will, and, If we shall live, we will do this or that.</p>

<p>4:16. But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is<br>
wicked.</p>

<p>4:17. To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it<br>
is sin.</p>

<p>James Chapter 5</p>

<p>A woe to the rich that oppress the poor. Exhortations to patience and to<br>
avoid swearing. Of the anointing the sick, confession of sins and<br>
fervour in prayer.</p>

<p>5:1. Go to now, ye rich men: weep and howl in your miseries, which shall<br>
come upon you.</p>

<p>5:2. Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.</p>

<p>5:3. Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for<br>
a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. &nbsp;You have<br>
stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.</p>

<p>5:4. Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields,<br>
which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them<br>
hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</p>

<p>5:5. You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished<br>
your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</p>

<p>5:6. You have condemned and put to death the Just One: and he resisted<br>
you not.</p>

<p>5:7. Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.<br>
Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth:<br>
patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.</p>

<p>5:8. Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts: for the<br>
coming of the Lord is at hand.</p>

<p>5:9. Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be<br>
judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.</p>

<p>5:10. Take, my brethren, for example of suffering evil, of labour and<br>
patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>5:11. Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard<br>
of the patience of Job and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the<br>
Lord is merciful and compassionate.</p>

<p>5:12. But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,<br>
nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be: Yea,<br>
Yea: No, No: that you fall not under judgment.</p>

<p>5:13. Is any of you sad? Let him pray: Is he cheerful in mind? Let him<br>
sing.</p>

<p>5:14. Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the<br>
church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>Let him bring in, etc... See here a plain warrant of scripture for the<br>
sacrament of extreme unction, that any controversy against its<br>
institution would be against the express words of the sacred text in the<br>
plainest terms.</p>

<p>5:15. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord<br>
shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>

<p>5:16. Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for<br>
another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man<br>
availeth much.</p>

<p>Confess your sins one to another... That is, to the priests of the<br>
church, whom (ver.14) he had ordered to be called for, and brought in to<br>
the sick; moreover, to confess to persons who had no power to forgive<br>
sins, would be useless. Hence the precept here means, that we must<br>
confess to men whom God hath appointed, and who, by their ordination<br>
and jurisdiction, have received the power of remitting sins in his name.</p>

<p>5:17. Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed<br>
that it might not rain upon the earth. And it rained not for three years<br>
and six months.</p>

<p>5:18. And he prayed again. And the heaven gave rain: and the earth<br>
brought forth her fruit.</p>

<p>5:19. My brethren, if any of you err from the truth and one convert him:</p>

<p>5:20. He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the<br>
error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a<br>
multitude of sins.</p>

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

method other than by check or money order.

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
