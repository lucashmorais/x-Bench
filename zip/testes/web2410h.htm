<h1>
Jeremiah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The words of Jeremiah the
son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of
Benjamin:  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to whom the word
of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in
the thirteenth year of his reign.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> It came also in the days of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh
year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away
of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Now the word of Yahweh came to me,
saying,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Before I formed
you in the belly I knew you, and before you came forth out of the womb I
sanctified you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh!
behold, I don't know how to speak; for I am a child.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> But Yahweh said to me, Don't say,
I am a child; for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever
I shall command you, you shall speak.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Don't be afraid because of them;
for I am with you to deliver you, says Yahweh.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Then Yahweh put forth his hand,
and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have put my words
in your mouth:  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> behold, I
have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up
and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
 <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Moreover the word of
Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? I said, I see a rod of
an almond tree.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Then said
Yahweh to me, You have well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.
 <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> The word of Yahweh came
to me the second time, saying, What see you? I said, I see a boiling
caldron; and its face is from the north.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Then Yahweh said to me, Out of
the north evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> For, behold, I will call
all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall
come, and they shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates
of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the
cities of Judah.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> I will
utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that
they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and
worshiped the works of their own hands.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> You therefore gird up your waist,
and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: don't be dismayed at
them, lest I dismay you before them.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> For, behold, I have made you this
day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the
whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its
priests, and against the people of the land.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> They shall fight against you; but
they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you, says Yahweh, to
deliver you.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
came to me, saying,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Go,
and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I remember for
you the kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went
after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Israel <I>was</I> holiness to
Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase: all who devour him shall be held
guilty; evil shall come on them, says Yahweh.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Hear you the word of Yahweh, O
house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> thus says Yahweh, What
unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far
from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Neither said they, Where is Yahweh
who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the
wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of
drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed
through, and where no man lived?  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> I brought you into a plentiful
land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled
my land, and made my heritage an abomination.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> The priests didn't say, Where is
Yahweh? and those who handle the law didn't know me: the rulers also
transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked
after things that do not profit.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Therefore I will yet contend with
you, says Yahweh, and with your children's children will I contend.
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For pass over to the
islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently;
and see if there has been such a thing.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Has a nation changed <I>its</I>
gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for
that which does not profit.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Be astonished, you heavens, at
this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says Yahweh.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> For my people have committed two
evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and cut them
out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Is Israel a servant? is he a
native-born <I>slave</I>? why is he become a prey?  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> The young lions have roared on
him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned
up, without inhabitant.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> The children also of Memphis and
Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Haven't you procured this to
yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by
the way?  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Now what have
you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what
have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
 <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Your own wickedness shall
correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you: know therefore and
see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh
your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
 <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> For of old time I have
broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve;
for on every high hill and under every green tree you did bow yourself,
playing the prostitute.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Yet I had planted you a noble
vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate
branches of a foreign vine to me?  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> For though you wash yourself with
lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the
Lord Yahweh.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> How can you
say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in
the valley, know what you have done: <I>you are</I> a swift dromedary
traversing her ways;  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> a
wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire;
in her occasion who can turn her away? all those who seek her will not
weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> Withhold your foot from being
unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, It is in vain; no, for
I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> As the thief is ashamed when he
is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their
princes, and their priests, and their prophets;  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> who tell a stock, You are my
father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned
their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble
they will say, Arise, and save us.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> But where are your gods that you
have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your
trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.
 <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> Why will you contend with
me? you all have transgressed against me, says Yahweh.  <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> In vain have I struck your
children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your
prophets, like a destroying lion.  <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> Generation, see the word of
Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness?
why say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?
 <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> Can a virgin forget her
ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days
without number.  <a name="C2V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:33</font></a> How
trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women have
you taught your ways.  <a name="C2V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:34</font></a> Also in your skirts is found the
blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking
in; but it is because of all these things.  <a name="C2V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:35</font></a> Yet you said, I am innocent;
surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into
judgment with you, because you say, I have not sinned.  <a name="C2V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:36</font></a> Why go you about so much to
change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed
of Assyria.  <a name="C2V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:37</font></a> From there
also you shall go forth, with your hands on your head: for Yahweh has
rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> They say, If a man put
away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, will he
return to her again? Won't that land be greatly polluted? But you have
played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Lift up your eyes
to the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the
ways have you sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have
polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Therefore the showers have been
withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's
forehead, you refused to be ashamed.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Will you not from this time cry to
me, My Father, you are the guide of my youth?  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Will he retain <I>his anger</I>
forever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and have done
evil things, and have had your way.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Moreover Yahweh said to me in the
days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has
done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree,
and there has played the prostitute.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> I said after she had done all
these things, She will return to me; but she didn't return: and her
treacherous sister Judah saw it.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> I saw, when, for this very cause
that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and
given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, didn't
fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> It happened through the lightness
of her prostitution, that the land was polluted, and she committed
adultery with stones and with stocks.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Yet for all this her treacherous
sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in
pretense, says Yahweh.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Backsliding
Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Go, and proclaim these words
toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I
will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not
keep <I>anger</I> forever.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Only acknowledge your iniquity,
that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered
your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed
my voice, says Yahweh.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Return, backsliding children,
says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you: and I will take you one of a city,
and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> and I will give you shepherds
according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and
understanding.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> It shall
come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those
days, says Yahweh, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of
Yahweh; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it;
neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> At that time they shall call
Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh; and all the nations shall be gathered to
it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more
after the stubbornness of their evil heart.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> In those days the house of Judah
shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of
the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your
fathers.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> But I said, How
I will put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly
heritage of the armies of the nations! and I said, You shall call me My
Father, and shall not turn away from following me.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> Surely as a wife treacherously
departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, house
of Israel, says Yahweh.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> A
voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping <I>and</I> the petitions
of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they
have forgotten Yahweh their God.  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Return, you backsliding children,
I will heal your backsliding. Behold, we are come to you; for you are
Yahweh our God.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Truly in
vain is <I>the help that is looked for</I> from the hills, the tumult on
the mountains: truly in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> But the shameful thing has
devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their
herds, their sons and their daughters.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> Let us lie down in our shame, and
let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we
and our fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed
the voice of Yahweh our God.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> If you will return,
Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me, and if you will put away
your abominations out of my sight; then you shall not be removed;  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> and you shall swear, As Yahweh
lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall
bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For thus says Yahweh to the men of
Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and don't sow among
thorns.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Circumcise
yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men
of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire,
and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
 <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Declare you in Judah, and
publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry aloud
and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
 <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Set up a standard toward
Zion: flee for safety, don't stay; for I will bring evil from the north,
and a great destruction.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> A
lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his
way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that
your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> For this gird you with sackcloth,
lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn't turned back from
us.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> It shall happen at
that day, says Yahweh, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the
heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the
prophets shall wonder.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh!
surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You
shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the life.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> At that time shall it be said to
this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the
wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to
cleanse;  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> a full wind from
these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.
 <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Behold, he shall come up
as clouds, and his chariots <I>shall be</I> as the whirlwind: his horses
are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are ruined.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Jerusalem, wash your heart from
wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge
within you?  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For a voice
declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> make you mention to the nations;
behold, publish against Jerusalem, <I>that</I> watchers come from a far
country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> As keepers of a field are they
against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Your way and your
doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness; for it
is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> My anguish, my anguish! I am
pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my
peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the
alarm of war.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Destruction
on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my
tents destroyed, <I>and</I> my curtains in a moment.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> How long shall I see the
standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> For my people are foolish, they
don't know me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding;
they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> I saw the earth, and, behold, it
was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> I saw the mountains, and behold,
they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> I saw, and behold, there was no
man, and all the birds of the sky had fled.  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> I saw, and behold, the fruitful
field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the
presence of Yahweh, <I>and</I> before his fierce anger.  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, The whole
land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> For this shall the earth mourn,
and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed
it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> Every city flees for the noise of
the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the
rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> You, when you are made desolate,
what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck
you with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in
vain do you make yourself beautiful; <I>your</I> lovers despise you, they
seek your life.  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> For I
have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who
brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps
for breath, who spreads her hands, <I>saying</I>, Woe is me now! for my
soul faints before the murderers.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Run you back and forth
through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the
broad places of it, if you can find a man, if there are any who does
justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Though they say, As Yahweh lives;
surely they swear falsely.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> O Yahweh, don't your eyes look on
truth? you have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have
consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made
their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Then I said, Surely these are
poor; they are foolish; for they don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law
of their God:  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> I will get
me to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of
Yahweh, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken
the yoke, and burst the bonds.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Therefore a lion out of the forest
shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard
shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be
torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, <I>and</I> their
backsliding is increased.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> How can I pardon you? your
children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had
fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in
troops at the prostitutes' houses.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> They were as fed horses roaming at
large; everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Shall I not visit for these
things? says Yahweh; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as
this?  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Go up on her walls,
and destroy; but don't make a full end: take away her branches; for they
are not Yahweh's.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> For the
house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously
against me, says Yahweh.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> They have denied Yahweh, and
said, It is not he; neither shall evil come on us; neither shall we see
sword nor famine:  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> and the
prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be
done to them.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Therefore
thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, Because you speak this word, behold,
I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it
shall devour them.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Behold, I will bring a nation on
you from far, house of Israel, says Yahweh: it is a mighty nation, it is
an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don't know, neither
understand what they say.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Their quiver is an open tomb,
they are all mighty men.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> They shall eat up your harvest,
and your bread, <I>which</I> your sons and your daughters should eat; they
shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and
your fig trees; they shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you
trust, with the sword.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> But even in those days, says
Yahweh, I will not make a full end with you.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> It shall happen, when you shall
say, Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us? then you shall
say to them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your
land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> Declare you this in the house of
Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> Hear now this, foolish people,
and without understanding; who have eyes, and don't see; who have ears,
and don't hear:  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Don't you
fear me? says Yahweh: won't you tremble at my presence, who have placed
the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can't
pass it? and though its waves toss themselves, yet they can't prevail;
though they roar, yet they can't pass over it.  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> But this people has a revolting
and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> Neither say they in their heart,
Let us now fear Yahweh our God, who gives rain, both the former and the
latter, in its season; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the
harvest.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Your iniquities
have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.
 <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> For among my people are
found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap,
they catch men.  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> As a cage
is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are
become great, and grew rich.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> They are grew fat, they shine:
yes, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they don't plead the cause, the
cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy
they don't judge.  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> Shall I
not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on
such a nation as this?  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> A
wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> the prophets prophesy falsely,
and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it
so: and what will you do in the end of it?
<p>  <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Flee for safety, you
children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet
in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth
from the north, and a great destruction.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> The comely and delicate one, the
daughter of Zion, will I cut off.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Shepherds with their flocks shall
come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her all around; they
shall feed everyone in his place.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Prepare you war against her;
arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day declines, for the
shadows of the evening are stretched out.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Arise, and let us go up by night,
and let us destroy her palaces.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> For thus has Yahweh of Armies
said, Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the
city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> As a well casts forth its waters,
so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in
her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my
soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not
inhabited.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Thus says
Yahweh of Armies, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a
vine: turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> To whom shall I speak and
testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they
can't listen: behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach;
they have no delight in it.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Therefore I am full of the wrath
of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the
street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband
with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.
 <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Their houses shall be
turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will
stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> For from the least of them even
to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness; and from the
prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> They have healed also the hurt of
my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Were they ashamed when they had
committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could
they blush: therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time
that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in
the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and
walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We
will not walk <I>therein</I>.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> I set watchmen over you,
<I>saying</I>, Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will
not listen.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> Therefore
hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Hear, earth: behold, I will bring
evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have
not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
 <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> To what purpose comes
there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far
country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices
pleasing to me.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Therefore
thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people;
and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the
neighbor and his friend shall perish.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a
people comes from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred
up from the uttermost parts of the earth.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> They lay hold on bow and spear;
they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and
they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle,
against you, daughter of Zion.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> We have heard its report; our
hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, <I>and</I> pangs as of a
woman in travail.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> Don't
go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy,
<I>and</I> terror, are on every side.  <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> Daughter of my people, gird you
with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an
only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come
on us.  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> I have made you a
tester of metals <I>and</I> a fortress among my people; that you may know
and try their way.  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> They
are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and
iron: they all of them deal corruptly.  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> The bellows blow fiercely; the
lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the
wicked are not plucked away.  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> Refuse silver shall men them,
because Yahweh has rejected them.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Stand in the gate of Yahweh's
house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Yahweh, all
you of Judah, who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to
dwell in this place.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Don't
you trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Yahweh, the temple of
Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, are these.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> For if you thoroughly amend your
ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and
his neighbor;  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> if you don't
oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, and don't shed
innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own
hurt:  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> then will I cause
you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from
of old even forevermore.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Behold, you trust in lying words,
that can't profit.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> Will
you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn
incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,
 <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> and come and stand before
me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered;
that you may do all these abominations?  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Is this house, which is called by
my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have
seen it, says Yahweh.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> But
go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to
dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
people Israel.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Now,
because you have done all these works, says Yahweh, and I spoke to you,
rising up early and speaking, but you didn't hear; and I called you, but
you didn't answer:  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> therefore will I do to the house
which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I
gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> I will cast you out of my sight,
as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Therefore don't you pray
for this people, neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them, neither make
intercession to me; for I will not hear you.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Don't you see what they do in the
cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> The children gather wood, and the
fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to
the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that
they may provoke me to anger.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Do they provoke me to anger? says
Yahweh; <I>do they</I> not <I>provoke</I> themselves, to the confusion of
their own faces?  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Therefore thus says the Lord
Yahweh: Behold, my anger and my wrath shall be poured out on this place,
on man, and on animal, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of
the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat meat.
 <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> For I didn't speak to
your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the
land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> but this thing I commanded them,
saying, Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my
people; and walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may be
well with you.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> But they
didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in <I>their own</I> counsels
<I>and</I> in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and
not forward.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Since the
day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I
have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and
sending them:  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> yet they
didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff:
they did worse than their fathers.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> You shall speak all these words
to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but
they will not answer you.  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> You shall tell them, This is the
nation that has not listened to the voice of Yahweh their God, nor
received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
 <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> Cut off your hair,
<I>Jerusalem</I>, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare
heights; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
 <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> For the children of Judah
have done that which is evil in my sight, says Yahweh: they have set their
abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
 <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> They have built the high
places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn
their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn't command, nor
did it come into my mind.  <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days come,
says Yahweh, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of
the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in
Topheth, until there be no place <I>to bury</I>.  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> The dead bodies of this people
shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth;
and none shall frighten them away.  <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> Then will I cause to cease from
the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth
and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
the bride; for the land shall become a waste.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> At that time, says
Yahweh, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the
bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the
prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their
graves;  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> and they shall
spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the sky,
which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they
have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped:
they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung on the
surface of the earth.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Death shall be chosen rather than
life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in
all the places where I have driven them, says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Moreover you shall tell them, Thus
says Yahweh: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away,
and not return?  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Why then
is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they
hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> I listened and heard, but they
didn't speak aright: no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, What
have I done? everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes headlong
in the battle.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Yes, the
stork in the sky knows her appointed times; and the turtledove and the
swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people
don't know Yahweh's law.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> How do you say, We are wise, and
the law of Yahweh is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes
has worked falsely.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> The
wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have
rejected the word of Yahweh; and what manner of wisdom is in them?  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Therefore will I give their wives
to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them: for everyone
from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the
prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> They have healed the hurt of the
daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no
peace.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Were they ashamed
when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall;
in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
 <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> I will utterly consume
them, says Yahweh: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the
fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and <I>the things that</I> I have given
them shall pass away from them.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> Why do we sit still? Assemble
yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be
silent there; for Yahweh our God has put us to silence, and given us water
of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Yahweh.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> We looked for peace, but no good
came; <I>and</I> for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> The snorting of his horses is
heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole
land trembles; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that
is in it; the city and those who dwell therein.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> For, behold, I will send
serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall
bite you, says Yahweh.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Oh
that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.
 <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> Behold, the voice of the
cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: isn't
Yahweh in Zion? Isn't her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger
with their engraved images, and with foreign vanities?  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> The harvest is past, the summer
is ended, and we are not saved.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> For the hurt of the daughter of
my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Is there no balm in Gilead? is
there no physician there? why then isn't the health of the daughter of my
people recovered?
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Oh that my head were
waters, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I might weep day and night for
the slain of the daughter of my people!  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> Oh that I had in the wilderness a
lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from
them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> They bend their tongue, <I>as it
were</I> their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land,
but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they don't know
me, says Yahweh.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Take you
heed everyone of his neighbor, and don't you trust in any brother; for
every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with
slanders.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> They will
deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have
taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit
iniquity.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Your habitation
is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Therefore thus
says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how
<I>else</I> should I do, because of the daughter of my people?  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it
speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in
his heart he lays wait for him.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> Shall I not visit them for these
things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as
this?  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> For the mountains
will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the
wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes
through; neither can men hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds
of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> I will make Jerusalem heaps, a
dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a
desolation, without inhabitant.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> Who is the wise man, that may
understand this? and <I>who is</I> he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has
spoken, that he may declare it? why is the land perished and burned up
like a wilderness, so that none passes through?  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> Yahweh says, Because they have
forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice,
neither walked therein,  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> but have walked after the
stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers
taught them;  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> therefore
thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them,
even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
 <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> I will scatter them also
among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I
will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies,
Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and
send for the skillful women, that they may come:  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> and let them make haste, and take
up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our
eyelids gush out with waters.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> For a voice of wailing is heard
out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have
forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you
women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your
daughters wailing, and everyone her neighbor lamentation.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> For death is come up into our
windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from
outside, <I>and</I> the young men from the streets.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead
bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful
after the harvester; and none shall gather <I>them</I>.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Don't let the
wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his
might, don't let the rich man glory in his riches;  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> but let him who glories glory in
this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am Yahweh who
exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for
in these things I delight, says Yahweh.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Behold, the days come, says
Yahweh, that I will punish all those who are circumcised in <I>their</I>
uncircumcision:  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> Egypt,
and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that
have the corners <I>of their hair</I> cut off, who dwell in the
wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of
Israel are uncircumcised in heart.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Hear the word which
Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, &quot;Don't
learn the way of the nations, and don't be dismayed at the signs of the
sky; for the nations are dismayed at them.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> For the customs of the peoples
are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands
of the workman with the axe.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> They deck it with silver and with
gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.
 <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> They are like a palm
tree, of turned work, and don't speak: they must be carried, because they
can't go. Don't be afraid of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it
in them to do good.&quot;  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> There is none like you, Yahweh;
you are great, and your name is great in might.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Who should not fear you, King of
the nations? for to you does it appertain; because among all the wise men
of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.
 <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> But they are together
brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> There is silver beaten into
plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of
the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their
clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> But Yahweh is the true God; he
is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth
trembles, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> You shall say this to them: The
gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from
the earth, and from under the heavens.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> He has made the earth by his
power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his
understanding has he stretched out the heavens:  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> when he utters his voice, there
is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend
from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings
forth the wind out of his treasuries.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Every man is become brutish
<I>and is</I> without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his
engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath
in them.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> They are
vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall
perish.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> The portion of
Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is
the tribe of his inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is his name.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Gather up your wares out of the
land, you who abide in the siege.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I
will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress
them, that they may feel <I>it</I>.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> Woe is me because of my hurt! my
wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is <I>my</I> grief, and I must
bear it.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> My tent is
destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from
me, and they are no more: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to
set up my curtains.  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> For
the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Yahweh:
therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
 <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> The voice of news,
behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make
the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> Yahweh, I know that the way of
man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
 <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Yahweh, correct me, but
in measure: not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Pour out your wrath on the
nations that don't know you, and on the families that don't call on your
name: for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and
consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Hear you the words of this
covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem;  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> and say you to
them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who doesn't
hear the words of this covenant,  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> which I commanded your fathers in
the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the
iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I
command you: so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> that I may establish the oath
which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and
honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, Yahweh.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all
these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> For I earnestly protested to your
fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even
to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> Yet they didn't obey, nor turn
their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart:
therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I
commanded them to do, but they didn't do them.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy
is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> They are turned back to
the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and
they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the
house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
 <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Therefore thus says
Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to
escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Then shall the cities of Judah
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they
offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their
trouble.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> For according
to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the
number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful
thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Therefore don't you pray for
this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear
them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> What has my beloved to do in my
house, seeing she has worked lewdness <I>with</I> many, and the holy flesh
is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Yahweh called your name, A green
olive tree, beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult
he has kindled fire on it, and its branches are broken.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> For Yahweh of Armies, who
planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the
house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for
themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Yahweh gave me knowledge of it,
and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> But I was like a gentle lamb
that is led to the slaughter; and I didn't know that they had devised
devices against me, <I>saying</I>, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be
no more remembered.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> But,
Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the
mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my
cause.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Therefore thus
says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying,
You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, that you not die by our
hand;  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> therefore thus
says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die
by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> and there shall be no remnant to
them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their
visitation.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Righteous are you,
Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet would I reason the cause with you:
why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they at ease who deal
very treacherously?  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> You
have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring
forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> But you, Yahweh, know me;
you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the
slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> How long shall the land mourn,
and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who
dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said,
He shall not see our latter end.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> If you have run with the footmen,
and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and
though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride
of the Jordan?  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> For even
your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt
treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don't
believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> I have forsaken my house, I have
cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the
hand of her enemies.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> My
heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her
voice against me; therefore I have hated her.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Is my heritage to me as a
speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her all around? go
you, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Many shepherds have destroyed my
vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my
pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> They have made it a desolation;
it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because
no man lays it to heart.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Destroyers are come on all the
bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the
one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.
 <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> They have sown wheat,
and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit
nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce
anger of Yahweh.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which
I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up
from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
 <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> It shall happen, after
that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them;
and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to
his land.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> It shall
happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by
my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal;
then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> But if they will not hear, then
will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh to
me, Go, and buy you a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don't put
it in water.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> So I bought
a belt according to the word of Yahweh, and put it on my waist.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to me the
second time, saying,  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Take
the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to
the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> So I went, and hid it by the
Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> It happened after many days, that
Yahweh said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from
there, which I commanded you to hide there.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Then I went to the Euphrates, and
dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hid it; and behold, the
belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Then the word of Yahweh came to
me, saying,  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Thus says
Yahweh, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great
pride of Jerusalem.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> This
evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of
their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship
them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> For as the belt cleaves to the
waist of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel
and the whole house of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a
people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would
not hear.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Therefore you
shall speak to them this word: Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Every
bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall tell you, Do we not
certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Then you shall tell them, Thus
says Yahweh, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even
the kings who sit on David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets,
and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> I will dash them one against
another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Yahweh: I will not
pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
 <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Hear you, and give ear;
don't be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Give glory to Yahweh your God,
before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark
mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of
death, and make it gross darkness.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> But if you will not hear it, my
soul shall weep in secret for <I>your</I> pride; and my eye shall weep
sore, and run down with tears, because Yahweh's flock is taken captive.
 <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Say you to the king and
to the queen mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses are
come down, even the crown of your glory.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> The cities of the South are shut
up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of
it; it is wholly carried away captive.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Lift up your eyes, and see those
who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your
beautiful flock?  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> What
will you say, when he shall set over you as head those whom you have
yourself taught to be friends to you? shall not sorrows take hold of you,
as of a woman in travail?  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> If you say in your heart, Why
are these things come on me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your
skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> Can the Ethiopian change his
skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, who are
accustomed to do evil.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> Therefore will I scatter them,
as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> This is your lot, the portion
measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and
trusted in falsehood.  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Therefore will I also uncover
your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> I have seen your abominations,
even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your
prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! you will
not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> Judah mourns, and its gates
languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is
gone up.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Their nobles
send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find
no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and
confounded, and cover their heads.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> Because of the ground which is
cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are
disappointed, they cover their heads.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Yes, the hind also in the field
calves, and forsakes <I>her young</I>, because there is no grass.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> The wild donkeys stand on the
bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because
there is no herbage.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Though our iniquities testify
against us, work you for your name's sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings
are many; we have sinned against you.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> You hope of Israel, its Savior in
the time of trouble, why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as
a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Why should you be like a scared
man, as a mighty man who can't save? yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of
us, and we are called by your name; don't leave us.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Thus says Yahweh to this people,
Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet:
therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now he will remember their
iniquity, and visit their sins.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Yahweh said to me, Don't pray
for this people for <I>their</I> good.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> When they fast, I will not hear
their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will
not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine,
and by the pestilence.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh!
behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall
you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Then Yahweh said to me, The
prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn't send them, neither have I
commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying
vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their
own heart.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Therefore
thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I
didn't send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this
land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> The people to whom they prophesy
shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and
the sword; and they shall have none to bury them--them, their wives, nor
their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.
 <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> You shall say this word
to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not
cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
with a very grievous wound.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> If I go forth into the field,
then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city,
then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the
priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> Have you utterly rejected Judah?
has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no
healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of
healing, and behold, dismay!  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> We acknowledge, Yahweh, our
wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against
you.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> Do not abhor
<I>us</I>, for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory:
remember, don't break your covenant with us.  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Are there any among the vanities
of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren't
you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made
all these things.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Then said Yahweh to
me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be
toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
 <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> It shall happen, when
they tell you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus
says Yahweh: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the
sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and
such as are for captivity, to captivity.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> I will appoint over them four
kinds, says Yahweh: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds
of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
 <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> I will cause them to be
tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of
Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in
Jerusalem.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> For who will
have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan you? or who will turn
aside to ask of your welfare?  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> You have rejected me, says
Yahweh, you are gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand
against you, and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> I have winnowed them with a fan
in the gates of the land; I have bereaved <I>them</I> of children, I have
destroyed my people; they didn't return from their ways.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> Their widows are increased to me
above the sand of the seas; I have brought on them against the mother of
the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to
fall on her suddenly.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> She
who has borne seven languishes; she has given up the spirit; her sun is
gone down while it was yet day; she has been disappointed and confounded:
and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies,
says Yahweh.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> Woe is me,
my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention
to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me;
<I>yet</I> everyone of them does curse me.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Yahweh said, Most certainly I
will strengthen you for good; most certainly I will cause the enemy to
make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of
affliction.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> Can one
break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> Your substance and your
treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all your
sins, even in all your borders.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> I will make <I>them</I> to pass
with your enemies into a land which you don't know; for a fire is kindled
in my anger, which shall burn on you.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> Yahweh, you know; remember me,
and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; don't take me away in your
longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> Your words were found, and I ate
them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I
am called by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> I didn't sit in the assembly of
those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand; for
you have filled me with indignation.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> Why is my pain perpetual, and my
wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you indeed be to me as a
deceitful <I>brook</I>, as waters that fail?  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh, If
you return, then will I bring you again, that you may stand before me; and
if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth:
they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> I will make you to this people a
fortified bronze wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall
not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you,
says Yahweh.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> I will
deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of
the hand of the terrible.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
came also to me, saying,  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> You shall not take a wife,
neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> For thus says Yahweh concerning
the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and
concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who
became the father of them in this land:  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> They shall die grievous deaths:
they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as
dung on the surface of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the
sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of
the sky, and for the animals of the earth.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, Don't enter
into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for
I have taken away my peace from this people, says Yahweh, even loving
kindness and tender mercies.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Both great and small shall die in
this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them,
nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> neither shall men break
<I>bread</I> for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither
shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or
for their mother.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> You
shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to
drink.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> For thus says
Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of
this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the
voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
 <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> It shall happen, when
you shall show this people all these words, and they shall tell you, Why
has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our
iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our
God?  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Then you shall tell
them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says Yahweh, and have walked
after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have
forsaken me, and have not kept my law;  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> and you have done evil more than
your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of
his evil heart, so that you don't listen to me:  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> therefore will I cast you forth
out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor
your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; for I
will show you no favor.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days
come, says Yahweh, that it shall no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who
brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> but, As Yahweh lives, who
brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all
the countries where he had driven them. I will bring them again into their
land that I gave to their fathers.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> Behold, I will send for many
fishermen, says Yahweh, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will
send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and
from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> For my eyes are on all their
ways; they are not hidden from my face, neither is their iniquity
concealed from my eyes.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> First I will recompense their
iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the
carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with
their abominations.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> Yahweh, my strength, and my
stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the
nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have
inherited nothing but lies, <I>even</I> vanity and things in which there
is no profit.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Shall a
man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> Therefore, behold, I will cause
them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might;
and they shall know that my name is Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> The sin of Judah is
written with a pen of iron, <I>and</I> with the point of a diamond: it is
engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;
 <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> while their children
remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees on the high
hills.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> My mountain in the
field, I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil,
<I>and</I> your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.
 <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> You, even of yourself,
shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you
to serve your enemies in the land which you don't know: for you have
kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: Cursed is the
man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs
from Yahweh.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> For he shall
be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but
shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not
inhabited.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Blessed is the
man who trusts in Yahweh, and whose trust Yahweh is.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> For he shall be as a tree planted
by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear
when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in
the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> The heart is deceitful above all
things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> I, Yahweh, search the mind, I
try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to
the fruit of his doings.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> As the partridge that sits on
<I>eggs</I> which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by
right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he
shall be a fool.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> A
glorious throne, <I>set</I> on high from the beginning, is the place of
our sanctuary.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Yahweh,
the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be disappointed. Those who
depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken
Yahweh, the spring of living waters.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall
be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> Behold, they tell me, Where is
the word of Yahweh? let it come now.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> As for me, I have not hurried
from being a shepherd after you; neither have I desired the woeful day;
you know: that which came out of my lips was before your face.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Don't be a terror to me: you are
my refuge in the day of evil.  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> Let them be disappointed who
persecute me, but let not me be disappointed; let them be dismayed, but
don't let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them
with double destruction.  <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> Thus said Yahweh to me: Go, and
stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the kings
of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of
Jerusalem;  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> and tell
them, Hear you the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Take heed to
yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the
gates of Jerusalem;  <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> neither carry forth a burden out
of your houses on the Sabbath day holy, neither do any work: but make the
Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.  <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> But they didn't listen, neither
turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and
might not receive instruction.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> It shall happen, if you
diligently listen to me, says Yahweh, to bring in no burden through the
gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy,
to do no work therein;  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> then shall there enter in by the
gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David,
riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of
Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain
forever.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> They shall come
from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from
the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill country, and
from the South, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meal
offerings, and frankincense, and bringing <I>sacrifices of</I>
thanksgiving, to the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> But if you will not listen to me
to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the
gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in its
gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be
quenched.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> The word which came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Arise, and go down to the
potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> Then I went down to the potter's
house, and behold, he was making a work on the wheels.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> When the vessel that he made of
the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another
vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> Then the word of Yahweh came to
me, saying,  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> House of
Israel, can't I do with you as this potter? says Yahweh. Behold, as the
clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> At what instant I shall speak
concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break
down and to destroy it;  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> if that nation, concerning which
I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I
thought to do to them.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> At
what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
to build and to plant it;  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> if they do that which is evil in
my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good,
with which I said I would benefit them.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Now therefore, speak to the men
of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh:
Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return
you now everyone from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
 <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> But they say, It is in
vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do everyone
after the stubbornness of his evil heart.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh: Ask
you now among the nations, who has heard such things; the virgin of Israel
has done a very horrible thing.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Shall the snow of Lebanon fail
from the rock of the field? <I>or</I> shall the cold waters that flow down
from afar be dried up?  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> For my people have forgotten me,
they have burned incense to false <I>gods</I>; and they have been made to
stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, in a way
not built up;  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> to make
their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; everyone who passes
thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> I will scatter them as with an
east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face,
in the day of their calamity.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Then said they, Come, and let us
devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the
priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come,
and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of
his words.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Give heed to
me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> Shall evil be recompensed for
good? for they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before you
to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Therefore deliver up their
children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and
let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain
of death, <I>and</I> their young men struck of the sword in battle.
 <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Let a cry be heard from
their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them; for they have
dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Yet, Yahweh, you know all their
counsel against me to kill me; don't forgive their iniquity, neither blot
out their sin from your sight; but let them be overthrown before you; deal
you with them in the time of your anger.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> Thus said Yahweh, Go,
and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and <I>take</I> of the elders of the
people, and of the elders of the priests;  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> and go forth to the valley of the
son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim
there the words that I shall tell you;  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> and say, Hear you the word of
Yahweh, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which
whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> Because they have forsaken me,
and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other
gods, that they didn't know, they and their fathers and the kings of
Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> and have built the high places of
Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I
didn't command, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> therefore, behold, the days come,
says Yahweh, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The
valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> I will make void the counsel of
Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the
sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life:
and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky, and
for the animals of the earth.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> I will make this city an
astonishment, and a hissing; everyone who passes thereby shall be
astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> I will cause them to eat the
flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat
everyone the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, with
which their enemies, and those who seek their life, shall distress them.
 <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Then you shall break the
bottle in the sight of the men who go with you,  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> and shall tell them, Thus says
Yahweh of Armies: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one
breaks a potter's vessel, that can't be made whole again; and they shall
bury in Topheth, until there be no place to bury.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> Thus will I do to this place,
says Yahweh, and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth:
 <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> and the houses of
Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall
be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have
burned incense to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink
offerings to other gods.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> Then came Jeremiah from Topheth,
where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of
Yahweh's house, and said to all the people:  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all
the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their
neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Now Pashhur, the son
of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh, heard
Jeremiah prophesying these things.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the
prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of
Benjamin, which was in the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> It happened on the next day, that
Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to
him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I
will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they
shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and
I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall
carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Moreover I will give all the
riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it,
yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of
their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry
them to Babylon.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> You,
Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you
shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be
buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.
 <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Yahweh, you have
persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have
prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.
 <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> For as often as I speak,
I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Yahweh is
made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> If I say, I will not make mention
of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it
were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing,
and I can't <I>contain</I>.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> For I have heard the defaming of
many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, <I>say</I>
all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; peradventure he will
be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our
revenge on him.  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> But
Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall
stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed,
because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor
which shall never be forgotten.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests
the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance
on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> Sing to Yahweh, praise you
Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of
evil-doers.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Cursed be
the day in which I was born: don't let the day in which my mother bore me
be blessed.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Cursed be
the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy is born to you;
making him very glad.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> Let that man be as the cities
which Yahweh overthrew, and didn't repent: and let him hear a cry in the
morning, and shouting at noontime;  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> because he didn't kill me from
the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always
great.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Why came I forth
out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed
with shame?
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> The word which came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of
Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Please inquire of Yahweh for us;
for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us: peradventure
Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may
go up from us.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Then said
Jeremiah to them, You shall tell Zedekiah:  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your
hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the
Chaldeans who besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into
the midst of this city.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> I
myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong
arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> I will strike the inhabitants of
this city, both man and animal: they shall die of a great pestilence.
 <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> Afterward, says Yahweh, I
will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people,
even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword,
and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their
life: and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not
spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> To this people you shall say,
Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of
death.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> He who remains in
this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
pestilence; but he who goes out, and passes over to the Chaldeans who
besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.
 <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> For I have set my face
on this city for evil, and not for good, says Yahweh: it shall be given
into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
 <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> Touching the house of
the king of Judah, hear you the word of Yahweh:  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> House of David, thus says
Yahweh, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out
of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn
so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> Behold, I am against you, O
inhabitant of the valley, <I>and</I> of the rock of the plain, says
Yahweh; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter
into our habitations?  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> I
will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Yahweh; and I
will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is around
her.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> Thus said Yahweh: Go
down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> Say, Hear the word of Yahweh,
king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants,
and your people who enter in by these gates.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: Execute you
justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand
of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the foreigner, the
fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
 <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> For if you do this thing
indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting
on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his
servants, and his people.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> But if you will not hear these
words, I swear by myself, says Yahweh, that this house shall become a
desolation.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> For thus says
Yahweh concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are Gilead to me,
<I>and</I> the head of Lebanon; <I>yet</I> surely I will make you a
wilderness, <I>and</I> cities which are not inhabited.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> I will prepare destroyers against
you, everyone with his weapons; and they shall cut down your choice
cedars, and cast them into the fire.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> Many nations shall pass by this
city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why has Yahweh done
thus to this great city?  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> Then they shall answer, Because
they forsook the covenant of Yahweh their God, and worshiped other gods,
and served them.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Don't
you weep for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him who goes
away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> For thus says Yahweh touching
Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah
his father, <I>and</I> who went forth out of this place: He shall not
return there any more.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> But in the place where they have
led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.
 <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> Woe to him who builds
his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; who uses his
neighbor's service without wages, and doesn't give him his hire;  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> who says, I will build me a wide
house and spacious chambers, and cuts him out windows; and it is ceiling
with cedar, and painted with vermilion.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> Shall you reign, because you
strive to excel in cedar? Didn't your father eat and drink, and do justice
and righteousness? then it was well with him.  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> He judged the cause of the poor
and needy; then it was well. Wasn't this to know me? says Yahweh.  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> But your eyes and your heart are
not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for
oppression, and for violence, to do it.  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh
concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not
lament for him, <I>saying</I>, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall
not lament for him, <I>saying</I> Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> He shall be buried with the
burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
 <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> Go up to Lebanon, and
cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your
lovers are destroyed.  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> I
spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has
been your manner from your youth, that you didn't obey my voice.  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> The wind shall feed all your
shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then you will
be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes
your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs
come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> As I live, says Yahweh, though
Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right
hand, yet would I pluck you there;  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> and I will give you into the
hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you
are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into
the hand of the Chaldeans.  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> I will cast you out, and your
mother who bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and
there you will die.  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> But
to the land whereunto their soul longs to return, there shall they not
return.  <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> Is this man
Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel in which none delights?
why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which
they don't know?  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> O
earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Write you this
man childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall
a man of his seed prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling in
Judah.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Woe to the shepherds
who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh, the
God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed my people: You have
scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them;
behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings, says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> I will gather the remnant of my
flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring
them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
 <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> I will set up shepherds
over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be
dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Behold, the days come, says
Yahweh, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign
as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in
the land.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> In his days
Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name
by which he shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days come,
says Yahweh, that they shall no more say, As Yahweh lives, who brought up
the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> but, As Yahweh lives, who brought
up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country,
and from all the countries where I had driven them. They shall dwell in
their own land.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> Concerning the prophets. My heart
within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like
a man whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy
words.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> For the land is
full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures
of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is
not right;  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> for both
prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their
wickedness, says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> Therefore their way shall be to
them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall
therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation,
says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> I have seen
folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my
people Israel to err.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> In
the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit
adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers,
so that none does return from his wickedness: they are all of them become
to me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh of
Armies concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem
is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies,
Don't listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you: they teach
you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the
mouth of Yahweh.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> They
say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said, You shall have
peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they
say, No evil shall come on you.  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> For who has stood in the council
of Yahweh, that he should perceive and hear his word? who has marked my
word, and heard it?  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> Behold, the storm of Yahweh,
<I>even his</I> wrath, is gone forth, yes, a whirling storm: it shall
burst on the head of the wicked.  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> The anger of Yahweh shall not
return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of
his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> I sent not these prophets, yet
they ran: I didn't speak to them, yet they prophesied.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> But if they had stood in my
council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned
them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.  <a name="C23V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:23</font></a> Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh,
and not a God afar off?  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> Can any hide himself in secret
places so that I shall not see him? says Yahweh. Don't I fill heaven and
earth? says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:25</font></a> I
have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name,
saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.  <a name="C23V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:26</font></a> How long shall this be in the
heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit
of their own heart?  <a name="C23V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:27</font></a> who
think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell
every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.
 <a name="C23V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:28</font></a> The prophet who has a
dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word
faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:29</font></a> Isn't my word like fire? says
Yahweh; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> Therefore, behold, I am against
the prophets, says Yahweh, who steal my words everyone from his neighbor.
 <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> Behold, I am against the
prophets, says Yahweh, who use their tongues, and say, He says.  <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> Behold, I am against those who
prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh, and do tell them, and cause my people
to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I didn't send them,
nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C23V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:33</font></a> When this
people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the
burden of Yahweh? then you shall tell them, What burden! I will cast you
off, says Yahweh.  <a name="C23V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:34</font></a> As for
the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of
Yahweh, I will even punish that man and his house.  <a name="C23V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:35</font></a> You shall say everyone to his
neighbor, and everyone to his brother, What has Yahweh answered? and, What
has Yahweh spoken?  <a name="C23V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:36</font></a> You
shall mention the burden of Yahweh no more: for every man's own word shall
be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of
Yahweh of Armies our God.  <a name="C23V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:37</font></a> You shall say to the prophet,
What has Yahweh answered you? and, What has Yahweh spoken?  <a name="C23V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:38</font></a> But if you say, The burden of
Yahweh; therefore thus says Yahweh: Because you say this word, The burden
of Yahweh, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden
of Yahweh;  <a name="C23V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:39</font></a> therefore,
behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city
that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence:  <a name="C23V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:40</font></a> and I will bring an everlasting
reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Yahweh showed me, and
behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Yahweh, after that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son
of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen
and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> One basket had very good figs,
like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs,
which could not be eaten, they were so bad.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> Then said Yahweh to me, What see
you, Jeremiah? I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very
bad, that can't be eaten, they are so bad.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to me,
saying,  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of
Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans,
for good.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> For I will set
my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I
will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not
pluck them up.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> I will
give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my
people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their
whole heart.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> As the bad
figs, which can't be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus says Yahweh, So
will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the
residue of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the
land of Egypt,  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> I will
even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of
the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse,
in all places where I shall drive them.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> I will send the sword, the
famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they be consumed from off
the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> which Jeremiah the prophet spoke
to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
saying:  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> From the
thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this
day, these twenty-three years, the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I
have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not
listened.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> Yahweh has sent
to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them,
(but you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear),  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> saying, Return you now everyone
from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land
that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even
forevermore;  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> and don't go
after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don't provoke me to
anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no harm.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> Yet you have not listened to me,
says Yahweh; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands
to your own hurt.  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh of
Armies: Because you have not heard my words,  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> behold, I will send and take all
the families of the north, says Yahweh, and <I>I will send</I> to
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them
against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these
nations around; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an
astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> Moreover I will take from them
the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom
and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of
the lamp.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> This whole
land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall
serve the king of Babylon seventy years.  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> It shall happen, when seventy
years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that
nation, says Yahweh, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans;
and I will make it desolate forever.  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> I will bring on that land all my
words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this
book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> For many nations and great kings
shall make bondservants of them, even of them; and I will recompense them
according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
 <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> For thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel, to me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand,
and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> They shall drink, and reel back
and forth, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
 <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> Then took I the cup at
Yahweh's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent
me:  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> <I>to wit</I>,
Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to
make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is
this day;  <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> Pharaoh king
of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> and all the mixed people, and
all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines,
and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;  <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> Edom, and Moab, and the children
of Ammon;  <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> and all the
kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which
is beyond the sea;  <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and
all who have the corners <I>of their hair</I> cut off;  <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> and all the kings of Arabia, and
all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;  <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> and all the kings of Zimri, and
all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;  <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> and all the kings of the north,
far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which
are on the surface of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink
after them.  <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> You shall
tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Drink you, and
be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword
which I will send among you.  <a name="C25V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:28</font></a> It shall be, if they refuse to
take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, Thus says
Yahweh of Armies: You shall surely drink.  <a name="C25V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:29</font></a> For, behold, I begin to work
evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly
unpunished? You shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on
all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C25V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:30</font></a> Therefore prophesy you against
them all these words, and tell them, Yahweh will roar from on high, and
utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against
his fold; he will give a shout, as those who tread <I>the grapes</I>,
against all the inhabitants of the earth.  <a name="C25V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:31</font></a> A noise shall come even to the
end of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations; he will
enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them
to the sword, says Yahweh.  <a name="C25V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:32</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies,
Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall
be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.  <a name="C25V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:33</font></a> The slain of Yahweh shall be at
that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth:
they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be
dung on the surface of the ground.  <a name="C25V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:34</font></a> Wail, you shepherds, and cry;
and wallow <I>in ashes</I>, you principal of the flock; for the days of
your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall
like a goodly vessel.  <a name="C25V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:35</font></a> The shepherds shall have no way
to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.  <a name="C25V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:36</font></a> A voice of the cry of the
shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Yahweh lays
waste their pasture.  <a name="C25V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:37</font></a> The
peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of
Yahweh.  <a name="C25V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:38</font></a> He has left his
covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of
the fierceness of the oppressing <I>sword</I>, and because of his fierce
anger.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> In the beginning of
the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word
from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh: Stand in the court of Yahweh's house, and speak to all the
cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh's house, all the words
that I command you to speak to them; don't diminish a word.  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> It may be they will listen, and
turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I
purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> You shall tell them, Thus says
Yahweh: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set
before you,  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> to listen to
the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up
early and sending them, but you have not listened;  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> then will I make this house like
Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
 <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> The priests and the
prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> It
happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had
commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the
prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, You shall surely
die.  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> Why have you
prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh,
and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? All the people were
gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> When the princes of Judah heard
these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of Yahweh;
and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's <I>house</I>.
 <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Then spoke the priests
and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is
worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have
heard with your ears.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> Then spoke Jeremiah to all the
princes and to all the people, saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy against
this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
 <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> Now therefore amend your
ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God; and Yahweh
will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> But as for me, behold, I am in
your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> Only know for certain that, if
you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on
this city, and on its inhabitants; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to
you to speak all these words in your ears.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> Then said the princes and all
the people to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of
death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.  <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> Then rose up certain of the
elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
 <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> Micah the Morashtite
prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the
people of Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Zion shall be plowed
as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
house as the high places of a forest.  <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and
all Judah put him to death? Didn't he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor
of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced
against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
 <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> There was also a man who
prophesied in the name of Yahweh, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath
Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land
according to all the words of Jeremiah:  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> and when Jehoiakim the king,
with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king
sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and
fled, and went into Egypt:  <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> and Jehoiakim the king sent men
into Egypt, <I>namely</I>, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men
with him, into Egypt;  <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> and they fetched forth Uriah out
of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the
sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
 <a name="C26V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:24</font></a> But the hand of Ahikam
the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into
the hand of the people to put him to death.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> In the beginning of
the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh to me: Make
bonds and bars, and put them on your neck;  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> and send them to the king of
Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon,
and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the
messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> and give them a command to their
masters, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, You shall
tell your masters:  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> I have
made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the surface of the
earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it to whom
it seems right to me.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> Now
have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon, my servant; and the animals of the field also have I given him to
serve him.  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> All the
nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of
his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him
their bondservant.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> It
shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the
same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck
under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says
Yahweh, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence,
until I have consumed them by his hand.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> But as for you, don't you listen
to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your
soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall
not serve the king of Babylon:  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> for they prophesy a lie to you,
to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and you
should perish.  <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> But the
nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
and serve him, that <I>nation</I> will I let remain in their own land,
says Yahweh; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> I spoke to Zedekiah king of
Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the
yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
 <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> Why will you die, you
and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as
Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of
Babylon?  <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> Don't listen to
the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve
the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.  <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> For I have not sent them, says
Yahweh, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out,
and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.
 <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> Also I spoke to the
priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Don't listen to
the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the
vessels of Yahweh's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon;
for they prophesy a lie to you.  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> Don't listen to them; serve the
king of Babylon, and live: why should this city become a desolation?
 <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> But if they be prophets,
and if the word of Yahweh be with them, let them now make intercession to
Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in the house of Yahweh,
and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don't go to
Babylon.  <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> For thus says
Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and
concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are
left in this city,  <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> which
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn't take, when he carried away captive
Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon,
and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;  <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> yes, thus says Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of
Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:  <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> They shall be carried to
Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, says
Yahweh; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> It happened the same
year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the
fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the
prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Yahweh, in the
presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
 <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> Within two full years
will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh's house, that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to
Babylon:  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> and I will bring
again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all
the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break
the yoke of the king of Babylon.  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to
the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence
of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh,  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> even the prophet Jeremiah said,
Amen: Yahweh do so; Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied,
to bring again the vessels of Yahweh's house, and all them of the
captivity, from Babylon to this place.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Nevertheless hear you now this
word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> The prophets who have been before
me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against
great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> The prophet who prophesies of
peace, when the word of the prophet shall happen, then shall the prophet
be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> Then Hananiah the prophet took
the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> Hananiah spoke in the presence
of all the people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Even so will I break the yoke
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck
of all the nations. The prophet Jeremiah went his way.  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> Then the word of Yahweh came to
Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the
neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> Go, and tell Hananiah, saying,
Thus says Yahweh: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in
their place bars of iron.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these
nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they
shall serve him: and I have given him the animals of the field also.
 <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> Then said the prophet
Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent
you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.  <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh,
Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth: this year
you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> So Hananiah the prophet died the
same year in the seventh month.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> Now these are the
words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the
residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the
prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away
captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,  <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> (after that Jeconiah the king,
and the queen mother, and the eunuchs, <I>and</I> the princes of Judah and
Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from
Jerusalem),  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> by the hand
of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom
Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
saying,  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> Thus says Yahweh
of Armies, the God of Israel, to all the captivity, whom I have caused to
be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:  <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> Build you houses, and dwell in
them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> Take wives, and father sons and
daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to
husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply you there,
and don't be diminished.  <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> Seek the peace of the city where
I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it;
for in its peace you shall have peace.  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel: Don't let your prophets who are in the midst of you,
and your diviners, deceive you; neither listen you to your dreams which
you cause to be dreamed.  <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> For they prophesy falsely to you
in my name: I have not sent them, says Yahweh.  <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, After
seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform
my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> For I know the thoughts that I
think toward you, says Yahweh, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give
you hope in your latter end.  <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> You shall call on me, and you
shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> You shall seek me, and find me,
when you shall search for me with all your heart.  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> I will be found by you, says
Yahweh, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from
all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says
Yahweh; and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to
be carried away captive.  <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> Because you have said, Yahweh
has raised us up prophets in Babylon;  <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> thus says Yahweh concerning the
king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who
dwell in this city, your brothers who haven't gone forth with you into
captivity;  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> thus says
Yahweh of Armies; Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and
the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that can't be eaten,
they are so bad.  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> I will
pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the
pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all
the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, and an astonishment,
and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven
them;  <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> because they have
not listened to my words, says Yahweh, with which I sent to them my
servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not
hear, says Yahweh.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> Hear
you therefore the word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity, whom I have
sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.  <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah
the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will
deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall
kill them before your eyes;  <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> and of them shall be taken up a
curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make
you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the
fire;  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> because they have
worked folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors'
wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn't command
them; and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> Concerning Shemaiah the
Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your own name
to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of
Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> Yahweh has made you priest in
the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house
of Yahweh, for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you
should put him in the stocks and in shackles.  <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> Now therefore, why have you not
rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,  <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> because he has sent to us in
Babylon, saying, <I>The captivity</I> is long: build you houses, and dwell
in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?  <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> Zephaniah the priest read this
letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  <a name="C29V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:30</font></a> Then came the word of Yahweh to
Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C29V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:31</font></a> Send
to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah
the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn't send
him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;  <a name="C29V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:32</font></a> therefore thus says Yahweh,
Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not
have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he see the good that
I will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken rebellion
against Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of
Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a
book.  <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> For, behold, the
days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people
Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land
that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> These are the words that Yahweh
spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.  <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> For thus says Yahweh: We have
heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> Ask now, and see whether a man
does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his
waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
 <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> Alas! for that day is
great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble;
but he shall be saved out of it.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> It shall come to pass in that
day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,
and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their
bondservant;  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> but they
shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up
to them.  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> Therefore don't
you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed,
Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the
land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at
ease, and none shall make him afraid.  <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> For I am with you, says Yahweh,
to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have
scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct
you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.  <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt
is incurable, and your wound grievous.  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> There is none to plead your
cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> All your lovers have forgotten
you; they don't seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an
enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your
iniquity, because your sins were increased.  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> Why cry you for your hurt? your
pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins
were increased, I have done these things to you.  <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> Therefore all those who devour
you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall
go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who
prey on you will I give for a prey.  <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> For I will restore health to
you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have
called you an outcast, <I>saying</I>, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
 <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> Thus says Yahweh:
Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have
compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on its own
hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.  <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> Out of them shall proceed
thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply
them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall
not be small.  <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> Their
children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be
established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.  <a name="C30V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:21</font></a> Their prince shall be of
themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I
will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he
who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.  <a name="C30V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:22</font></a> You shall be my people, and I
will be your God.  <a name="C30V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:23</font></a> Behold, the storm of Yahweh,
<I>even his</I> wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping storm: it shall burst on
the head of the wicked.  <a name="C30V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:24</font></a> The fierce anger of Yahweh shall
not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents
of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it.
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> At that time, says
Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be
my people.  <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> Thus says
Yahweh, The people who were left of the sword found favor in the
wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> Yahweh appeared of old to me,
<I>saying</I>, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore
with loving kindness have I drawn you.  <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> Again will I build you, and you
shall be built, O virgin of Israel: again you shall be adorned with your
tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry.
 <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> Again you shall plant
vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall
enjoy <I>its fruit</I>.  <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> For there shall be a day, that
the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go
up to Zion to Yahweh our God.  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, Sing with
gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish you,
praise you, and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.
 <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> Behold, I will bring them
from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the
earth, <I>and</I> with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child
and her who travails with child together: a great company shall they
return here.  <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> They shall
come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them
to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not
stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> Hear the word of Yahweh, you
nations, and declare it in the islands afar off; and say, He who scattered
Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd does his flock.  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,
and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.  <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> They shall come and sing in the
height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain,
and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of
the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not
sorrow any more at all.  <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> Then shall the virgin rejoice in
the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their
mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their
sorrow.  <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> I will satiate
the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied
with my goodness, says Yahweh.  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: A voice is
heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her
children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are
no more.  <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> Thus says
Yahweh: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for
your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they shall come again from
the land of the enemy.  <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> There is hope for your latter
end, says Yahweh; and <I>your</I> children shall come again to their own
border.  <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> I have surely
heard Ephraim bemoaning himself <I>thus</I>, You have chastised me, and I
was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed <I>to the yoke</I>: turn you me, and
I shall be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.  <a name="C31V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:19</font></a> Surely after that I was turned,
I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was
ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my
youth.  <a name="C31V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:20</font></a> Is Ephraim my
dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do
earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearns for him; I will
surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.  <a name="C31V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:21</font></a> Set up road signs, make
guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you
went: turn again, virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.
 <a name="C31V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:22</font></a> How long will you go
here and there, you backsliding daughter? for Yahweh has created a new
thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.  <a name="C31V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:23</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah
and in its cities, when I shall bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless
you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.  <a name="C31V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:24</font></a> Judah and all its cities shall
dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
 <a name="C31V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:25</font></a> For I have satiated the
weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.  <a name="C31V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:26</font></a> On this I awakened, and saw; and
my sleep was sweet to me.  <a name="C31V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:27</font></a> Behold, the days come, says
Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with
the seed of man, and with the seed of animal.  <a name="C31V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:28</font></a> It shall happen that, like as I
have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and
to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to
plant, says Yahweh.  <a name="C31V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:29</font></a> In
those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and
the children's teeth are set on edge.  <a name="C31V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:30</font></a> But everyone shall die for his
own iniquity: every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set
on edge.  <a name="C31V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:31</font></a> Behold, the
days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of
Israel, and with the house of Judah:  <a name="C31V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:32</font></a> not according to the covenant
that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to
bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke,
although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.  <a name="C31V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:33</font></a> But this is the covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will
put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and
I will be their God, and they shall be my people:  <a name="C31V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:34</font></a> and they shall teach no more
every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh;
for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of
them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I
remember no more.  <a name="C31V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:35</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of
the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so
that its waves roar; Yahweh of Armies is his name:  <a name="C31V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:36</font></a> If these ordinances depart from
before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from
being a nation before me forever.  <a name="C31V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:37</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: If heaven
above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out
beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that
they have done, says Yahweh.  <a name="C31V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:38</font></a> Behold, the days come, says
Yahweh, that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel
to the gate of the corner.  <a name="C31V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:39</font></a> The measuring line shall go out
further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
 <a name="C31V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:40</font></a> The whole valley of the
dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to
the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh; it
shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.
<p> <a name="C32V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which
was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.  <a name="C32V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:2</font></a> Now at that time the king of
Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut
up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.
 <a name="C32V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:3</font></a> For Zedekiah king of
Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says
Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and he shall take it;  <a name="C32V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:4</font></a> and Zedekiah king of Judah shall
not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered
into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to
mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;  <a name="C32V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:5</font></a> and he shall bring Zedekiah to
Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you
fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?  <a name="C32V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:6</font></a> Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh
came to me, saying,  <a name="C32V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:7</font></a> Behold, Hanamel the son of
Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in
Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.  <a name="C32V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:8</font></a> So Hanamel my uncle's son came to
me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to
me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of
Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is
yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.
 <a name="C32V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:9</font></a> I bought the field that
was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even
seventeen shekels of silver.  <a name="C32V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:10</font></a> I subscribed the deed, and
sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the
balances.  <a name="C32V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:11</font></a> So I took the
deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and
conditions, and that which was open;  <a name="C32V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:12</font></a> and I delivered the deed of the
purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence
of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who
subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the
court of the guard.  <a name="C32V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:13</font></a> I
commanded Baruch before them, saying,  <a name="C32V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:14</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is
sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel;
that they may continue many days.  <a name="C32V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:15</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be
bought in this land.  <a name="C32V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:16</font></a> Now
after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of
Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C32V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:17</font></a> Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, you have
made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your
outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,  <a name="C32V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:18</font></a> who show loving kindness to
thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of
their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is
his name;  <a name="C32V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:19</font></a> great in
counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the
sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the
fruit of his doings:  <a name="C32V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:20</font></a> who
performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both
in Israel and among <I>other</I> men; and made you a name, as in this day;
 <a name="C32V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:21</font></a> and brought forth your
people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and
with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
 <a name="C32V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:22</font></a> and gave them this land,
which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with
milk and honey;  <a name="C32V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:23</font></a> and they
came in, and possessed it, but they didn't obey your voice, neither walked
in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do:
therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.  <a name="C32V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:24</font></a> Behold, the mounds, they are
come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the
Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine,
and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold,
you see it.  <a name="C32V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:25</font></a> You have
said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses;
whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.  <a name="C32V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:26</font></a> Then came the word of Yahweh to
Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C32V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:27</font></a> Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of
all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?  <a name="C32V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:28</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh:
Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the
hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:  <a name="C32V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:29</font></a> and the Chaldeans, who fight
against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with
the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured
out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.  <a name="C32V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:30</font></a> For the children of Israel and
the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from
their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger
with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.  <a name="C32V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:31</font></a> For this city has been to me a
provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it
even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,  <a name="C32V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:32</font></a> because of all the evil of the
children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to
provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and
their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 <a name="C32V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:33</font></a> They have turned to me
the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and
teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.  <a name="C32V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:34</font></a> But they set their abominations
in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.  <a name="C32V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:35</font></a> They built the high places of
Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons
and their daughters to pass through <I>the fire</I> to Molech; which I
didn't command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do
this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.  <a name="C32V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:36</font></a> Now therefore thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, It is given
into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and
by the pestilence:  <a name="C32V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:37</font></a> Behold, I will gather them out
of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my
wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this
place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:  <a name="C32V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:38</font></a> and they shall be my people, and
I will be their God:  <a name="C32V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:39</font></a> and
I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for
the good of them, and of their children after them:  <a name="C32V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:40</font></a> and I will make an everlasting
covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do
them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not
depart from me.  <a name="C32V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:41</font></a> Yes, I
will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land
assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.  <a name="C32V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:42</font></a> For thus says Yahweh: Like as I
have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them
all the good that I have promised them.  <a name="C32V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:43</font></a> Fields shall be bought in this
land, about which you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is
given into the hand of the Chaldeans.  <a name="C32V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:44</font></a> Men shall buy fields for money,
and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of
Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland,
and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to
return, says Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> Moreover the word of
Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the
court of the guard, saying,  <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh who does it,
Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is his name:  <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> Call to me, and I will answer
you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don't know.
 <a name="C33V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:4</font></a> For thus says Yahweh, the
God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the
houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down <I>to make a
defense</I> against the mounds and against the sword;  <a name="C33V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:5</font></a> while <I>men</I> come to fight
with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I
have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I
have hid my face from this city:  <a name="C33V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:6</font></a> Behold, I will bring it health
and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of
peace and truth.  <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> I will
cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and
will build them, as at the first.  <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> I will cleanse them from all
their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon
all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against me, and by which
they have transgressed against me.  <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> <I>This city</I> shall be to me
for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of
the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear
and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.
 <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: Yet
again there shall be heard in this place, about which you say, It is
waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without
inhabitant and without animal,  <a name="C33V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:11</font></a> the voice of joy and the voice
of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the
voice of those who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is
good, for his loving kindness endures forever; <I>and of them</I> who
bring <I>sacrifices of</I> thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh. For I
will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> Thus says Yahweh
of Armies: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without
man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds
causing their flocks to lie down.  <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> In the cities of the hill
country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and
in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the
cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who
numbers them, says Yahweh.  <a name="C33V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:14</font></a> Behold, the days come, says
Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning
the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.  <a name="C33V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:15</font></a> In those days, and at that time,
will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall
execute justice and righteousness in the land.  <a name="C33V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:16</font></a> In those days shall Judah be
saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is <I>the name</I> by
which she shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.  <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> For thus says Yahweh: David
shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
 <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> neither shall the
priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to
burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.  <a name="C33V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:19</font></a> The word of Yahweh came to
Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of
the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;
 <a name="C33V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:21</font></a> then may also my
covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to
reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
 <a name="C33V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:22</font></a> As the army of the sky
can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I
multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.
 <a name="C33V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:23</font></a> The word of Yahweh came
to Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C33V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:24</font></a> Don't you consider what this
people has spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh did choose, he
has cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no
more a nation before them.  <a name="C33V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:25</font></a> Thus says Yahweh: If my covenant
of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven
and earth;  <a name="C33V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:26</font></a> then will I
also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will
not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on
them.
<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> The word which came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his
army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and
all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the
cities of it, saying:  <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says
Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:  <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> and you shall not escape out of
his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your
eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with
you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.  <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O
Zedekiah king of Judah: thus says Yahweh concerning you, You shall not die
by the sword;  <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> you shall
die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who
were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall
lament you, <I>saying</I>, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says
Yahweh.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> Then Jeremiah the
prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
 <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> when the king of
Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities
of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these
<I>alone</I> remained of the cities of Judah <I>as</I> fortified cities.
 <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant
with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
 <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> that every man should let
his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a
Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, <I>to
wit</I>, of a Jew his brother.  <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> All the princes and all the
people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let
his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that none
should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:
 <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> but afterwards they
turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go
free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for
handmaids.  <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> Therefore the
word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C34V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:13</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
 <a name="C34V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:14</font></a> At the end of seven
years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been
sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from
you: but your fathers didn't listen to me, neither inclined their ear.
 <a name="C34V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:15</font></a> You were now turned, and
had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man
to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which
is called by my name:  <a name="C34V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:16</font></a> but you turned and profaned my
name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom
you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them
into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.  <a name="C34V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:17</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh: you
have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother,
and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says
Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will
make you to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
 <a name="C34V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:18</font></a> I will give the men who
have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the
covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and
passed between its parts;  <a name="C34V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:19</font></a> the princes of Judah, and the
princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of
the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;  <a name="C34V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:20</font></a> I will even give them into the
hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and
their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the
animals of the earth.  <a name="C34V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:21</font></a> Zedekiah king of Judah and his
princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of
those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's
army, who have gone away from you.  <a name="C34V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:22</font></a> Behold, I will command, says
Yahweh, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight
against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities
of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
<p> <a name="C35V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:1</font></a> The word which came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of
Judah, saying,  <a name="C35V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:2</font></a> Go to the
house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house
of Yahweh, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.  <a name="C35V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:3</font></a> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of
Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and
the whole house of the Rechabites;  <a name="C35V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:4</font></a> and I brought them into the house
of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the
man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the
chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
 <a name="C35V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:5</font></a> I set before the sons of
the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to
them, Drink you wine.  <a name="C35V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:6</font></a> But
they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our
father, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor
your sons, forever:  <a name="C35V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:7</font></a> neither shall you build house,
nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you
shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land in which you
sojourn.  <a name="C35V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:8</font></a> We have obeyed
the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he
commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or
our daughters;  <a name="C35V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:9</font></a> nor to
build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor
seed:  <a name="C35V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:10</font></a> but we have lived
in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our
father commanded us.  <a name="C35V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:11</font></a> But
it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land,
that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the
Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at
Jerusalem.  <a name="C35V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:12</font></a> Then came the
word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C35V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:13</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel: Go, and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words? says
Yahweh.  <a name="C35V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:14</font></a> The words of
Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine,
are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their
father's commandment: but I have spoken to you, rising up early and
speaking; and you have not listened to me.  <a name="C35V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:15</font></a> I have sent also to you all my
servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return
you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and don't go
after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I
have given to you and to your fathers: but you have not inclined your ear,
nor listened to me.  <a name="C35V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:16</font></a> Because the sons of Jonadab the
son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he
commanded them, but this people has not listened to me;  <a name="C35V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:17</font></a> therefore thus says Yahweh, the
God of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against
them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have
called to them, but they have not answered.  <a name="C35V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:18</font></a> Jeremiah said to the house of
the Rechabites, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Because you
have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;  <a name="C35V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:19</font></a> therefore thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man
to stand before me forever.
<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> It happened in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word
came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> Take a scroll of a book, and
write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and
against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you,
from the days of Josiah, even to this day.  <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> It may be that the house of Judah
will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return
every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their
sin.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> Then Jeremiah called
Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all
the words of Yahweh, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.
 <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> Jeremiah commanded
Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go into the house of Yahweh:  <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> therefore go you, and read in the
scroll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of Yahweh in the
ears of the people in Yahweh's house on the fast day; and also you shall
read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> It may be they will present their
supplication before Yahweh, and will return everyone from his evil way;
for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against
this people.  <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> Baruch the
son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded
him, reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh's house.  <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> Now it happened in the fifth year
of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that
all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities
of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> Then read Baruch in the book the
words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah the
son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new
gate of Yahweh's house, in the ears of all the people.  <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> When Micaiah the son of
Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of
Yahweh,  <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> he went down
into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and behold, all the
princes were sitting there, <I>to wit</I>, Elishama the scribe, and
Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah
the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
 <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> Then Micaiah declared to
them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the
ears of the people.  <a name="C36V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:14</font></a> Therefore all the princes sent
Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to
Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the
ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll
in his hand, and came to them.  <a name="C36V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:15</font></a> They said to him, Sit down now,
and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.  <a name="C36V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:16</font></a> Now it happened, when they had
heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to
Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.  <a name="C36V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:17</font></a> They asked Baruch, saying, Tell
us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?  <a name="C36V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:18</font></a> Then Baruch answered them, He
pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink
in the book.  <a name="C36V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:19</font></a> Then said
the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know
where you are.  <a name="C36V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:20</font></a> They went
in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the
chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of
the king.  <a name="C36V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:21</font></a> So the king
sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the chamber of
Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the
ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.  <a name="C36V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:22</font></a> Now the king was sitting in the
winter house in the ninth month: and <I>there was a fire in</I> the
brazier burning before him.  <a name="C36V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:23</font></a> It happened, when Jehudi had
read three or four leaves, that <I>the king</I> cut it with the penknife,
and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll
was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.  <a name="C36V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:24</font></a> They were not afraid, nor tore
their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all
these words.  <a name="C36V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:25</font></a> Moreover
Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that
he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them.  <a name="C36V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:26</font></a> The king commanded Jerahmeel the
king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of
Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid
them.  <a name="C36V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:27</font></a> Then the word of
Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and
the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C36V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:28</font></a> Take again another scroll, and
write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which
Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.  <a name="C36V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:29</font></a> Concerning Jehoiakim king of
Judah you shall say, Thus says Yahweh: You have burned this scroll,
saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall
certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there
man and animal?  <a name="C36V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:30</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh
concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the
throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the
heat, and in the night to the frost.  <a name="C36V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:31</font></a> I will punish him and his seed
and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I
have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen.  <a name="C36V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:32</font></a> Then took Jeremiah another
scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote
therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which
Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added
besides to them many like words.
<p> <a name="C37V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:1</font></a> Zedekiah the son of
Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.  <a name="C37V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:2</font></a> But neither he, nor his servants,
nor the people of the land, did listen to the words of Yahweh, which he
spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.  <a name="C37V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:3</font></a> Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal
the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to
the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.  <a name="C37V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:4</font></a> Now Jeremiah came in and went out
among the people; for they had not put him into prison.  <a name="C37V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:5</font></a> Pharaoh's army was come forth out
of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news
of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.  <a name="C37V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:6</font></a> Then came the word of Yahweh to
the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C37V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:7</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of
me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return
to Egypt into their own land.  <a name="C37V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:8</font></a> The Chaldeans shall come again,
and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with
fire.  <a name="C37V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:9</font></a> Thus says Yahweh,
Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from
us; for they shall not depart.  <a name="C37V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:10</font></a> For though you had struck the
whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but
wounded men among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent, and
burn this city with fire.  <a name="C37V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:11</font></a> It happened that, when the army
of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
 <a name="C37V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:12</font></a> then Jeremiah went forth
out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion
there, in the midst of the people.  <a name="C37V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:13</font></a> When he was in the gate of
Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son
of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the
prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.  <a name="C37V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:14</font></a> Then said Jeremiah, It is false;
I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he didn't listen to him; so
Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.  <a name="C37V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:15</font></a> The princes were angry with
Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan
the scribe; for they had made that the prison.  <a name="C37V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:16</font></a> When Jeremiah was come into the
dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many
days;  <a name="C37V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:17</font></a> Then Zedekiah the
king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house,
and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? Jeremiah said, There is. He said
also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.  <a name="C37V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:18</font></a> Moreover Jeremiah said to king
Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or
against this people, that you have put me in prison?  <a name="C37V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:19</font></a> Where now are your prophets who
prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you,
nor against this land?  <a name="C37V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:20</font></a> Now please hear, my lord the
king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not
cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
 <a name="C37V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:21</font></a> Then Zedekiah the king
commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and
they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all
the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of
the guard.
<p> <a name="C38V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:1</font></a> Shephatiah the son of
Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah,
and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to
all the people, saying,  <a name="C38V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, He who remains
in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be
to him for a prey, and he shall live.  <a name="C38V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:3</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, This city shall
surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he
shall take it.  <a name="C38V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:4</font></a> Then the
princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray you, be put to death;
because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city,
and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this
man doesn't seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt.  <a name="C38V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:5</font></a> Zedekiah the king said, Behold,
he is in your hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against
you.  <a name="C38V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:6</font></a> Then took they
Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that
was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. In
the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
 <a name="C38V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:7</font></a> Now when Ebedmelech the
Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put
Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),
 <a name="C38V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:8</font></a> Ebedmelech went forth out
of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,  <a name="C38V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:9</font></a> My lord the king, these men have
done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they
have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he
is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.  <a name="C38V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:10</font></a> Then the king commanded
Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and
take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.  <a name="C38V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:11</font></a> So Ebedmelech took the men with
him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took
there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the
dungeon to Jeremiah.  <a name="C38V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:12</font></a> Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to
Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes
under the cords. Jeremiah did so.  <a name="C38V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:13</font></a> So they drew up Jeremiah with
the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in
the court of the guard.  <a name="C38V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:14</font></a> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and
took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house
of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide
nothing from me.  <a name="C38V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:15</font></a> Then
Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put
me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.  <a name="C38V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:16</font></a> So Zedekiah the king swore
secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I
will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these
men who seek your life.  <a name="C38V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:17</font></a> Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah,
Thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: If you will go
forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and
this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your
house.  <a name="C38V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:18</font></a> But if you will
not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be
given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire,
and you shall not escape out of their hand.  <a name="C38V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:19</font></a> Zedekiah the king said to
Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans,
lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.  <a name="C38V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:20</font></a> But Jeremiah said, They shall
not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I
speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.
 <a name="C38V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:21</font></a> But if you refuse to go
forth, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:  <a name="C38V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:22</font></a> behold, all the women who are
left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of
Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have
set you on, and have prevailed over you: <I>now that</I> your feet are
sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.  <a name="C38V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:23</font></a> They shall bring out all your
wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of
their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you
shall cause this city to be burned with fire.  <a name="C38V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:24</font></a> Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah,
Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.  <a name="C38V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:25</font></a> But if the princes hear that I
have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us
now what you have said to the king; don't hide it from us, and we will not
put you to death; also what the king said to you:  <a name="C38V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:26</font></a> then you shall tell them, I
presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to
return to Jonathan's house, to die there.  <a name="C38V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:27</font></a> Then came all the princes to
Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words
that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the
matter was not perceived.  <a name="C38V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:28</font></a> So Jeremiah abode in the court
of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
<p> <a name="C39V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:1</font></a> It happened when
Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the
tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against
Jerusalem, and besieged it;  <a name="C39V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:2</font></a> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the
city),  <a name="C39V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:3</font></a> that all the
princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, <I>to
wit</I>, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal
Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
 <a name="C39V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:4</font></a> It happened that, when
Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they
fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's
garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the
Arabah.  <a name="C39V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:5</font></a> But the army of
the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of
Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he
gave judgment on him.  <a name="C39V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:6</font></a> Then the king of Babylon killed
the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon
killed all the nobles of Judah.  <a name="C39V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:7</font></a> Moreover he put out Zedekiah's
eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.  <a name="C39V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:8</font></a> The Chaldeans burned the king's
house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls
of Jerusalem.  <a name="C39V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:9</font></a> Then
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the
residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who
fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained.  <a name="C39V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:10</font></a> But Nebuzaradan the captain of
the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of
Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.  <a name="C39V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:11</font></a> Now Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning
Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C39V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:12</font></a> Take
him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he
shall tell you.  <a name="C39V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:13</font></a> So
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and
Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of
Babylon;  <a name="C39V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:14</font></a> they sent, and
took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so
he lived among the people.  <a name="C39V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:15</font></a> Now the word of Yahweh came to
Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,  <a name="C39V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:16</font></a> Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the
Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold,
I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they
shall be accomplished before you in that day.  <a name="C39V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:17</font></a> But I will deliver you in that
day, says Yahweh; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of
whom you are afraid.  <a name="C39V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:18</font></a> For
I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life
shall be for a prey to you; because you have put your trust in me, says
Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C40V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:1</font></a> The word which came to
Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among
all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to
Babylon.  <a name="C40V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:2</font></a> The captain of
the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Yahweh your God pronounced this
evil on this place;  <a name="C40V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:3</font></a> and
Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke: because you have
sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing
is come on you.  <a name="C40V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:4</font></a> Now,
behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it
seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care
of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don't:
behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you
to go, there go.  <a name="C40V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:5</font></a> Now
while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, <I>said he</I>, to Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made
governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or
go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave
him food and a present, and let him go.  <a name="C40V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:6</font></a> Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were
left in the land.  <a name="C40V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:7</font></a> Now
when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and
their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and
children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried
away captive to Babylon;  <a name="C40V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:8</font></a> then they came to Gedaliah to
Mizpah, <I>to wit</I>, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and
Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the
sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite,
they and their men.  <a name="C40V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:9</font></a> Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Don't be afraid to
serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and
it shall be well with you.  <a name="C40V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:10</font></a> As for me, behold, I will dwell
at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you,
gather you wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels,
and dwell in your cities that you have taken.  <a name="C40V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:11</font></a> Likewise when all the Jews who
were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were
in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of
Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son
of Shaphan;  <a name="C40V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:12</font></a> then all the
Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the
land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits
very much.  <a name="C40V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:13</font></a> Moreover
Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in
the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,  <a name="C40V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:14</font></a> and said to him, Do you know
that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn't believe
them.  <a name="C40V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:15</font></a> Then Johanan the
son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me
go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know
it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to
you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?  <a name="C40V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:16</font></a> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you
speak falsely of Ishmael.
<p> <a name="C41V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:1</font></a> Now it happened in the
seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of
the seed royal and <I>one of</I> the chief officers of the king, and ten
men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they
ate bread together in Mizpah.  <a name="C41V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:2</font></a> Then arose Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son
of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king
of Babylon had made governor over the land.  <a name="C41V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:3</font></a> Ishmael also killed all the Jews
who were with him, <I>to wit</I>, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the
Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.  <a name="C41V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:4</font></a> It happened the second day after
he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,  <a name="C41V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:5</font></a> that there came men from Shechem,
from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved
and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and
frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C41V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:6</font></a> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went
forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it
happened, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam.  <a name="C41V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:7</font></a> It was so, when
they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
killed them, <I>and cast them</I> into the midst of the pit, he, and the
men who were with him.  <a name="C41V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:8</font></a> But ten men were found among
those who said to Ishmael, Don't kill us; for we have stores hidden in the
field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he stopped,
and didn't kill them among their brothers.  <a name="C41V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:9</font></a> Now the pit in which Ishmael cast
all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah
(the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of
Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were
killed.  <a name="C41V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:10</font></a> Then Ishmael
carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah,
even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and
departed to go over to the children of Ammon.  <a name="C41V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:11</font></a> But when Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all
the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,  <a name="C41V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:12</font></a> then they took all the men, and
went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the
great waters that are in Gibeon.  <a name="C41V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:13</font></a> Now it happened that, when all
the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all
the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.  <a name="C41V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:14</font></a> So all the people who Ishmael
had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went
to Johanan the son of Kareah.  <a name="C41V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:15</font></a> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
 <a name="C41V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:16</font></a> Then took Johanan the
son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, all
the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had killed Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam, <I>to wit</I>, the men of war, and the women, and the children,
and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:  <a name="C41V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:17</font></a> and they departed, and lived in
Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,  <a name="C41V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:18</font></a> because of the Chaldeans; for
they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over
the land.
<p> <a name="C42V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:1</font></a> Then all the captains
of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of
Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came
near,  <a name="C42V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:2</font></a> and said to
Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray you, our supplication be presented
before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant;
for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us:  <a name="C42V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:3</font></a> that Yahweh your God may show us
the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.  <a name="C42V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:4</font></a> Then Jeremiah the prophet said to
them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according
to your words; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer
you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.  <a name="C42V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:5</font></a> Then they said to Jeremiah,
Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don't do according
to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us.  <a name="C42V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:6</font></a> Whether it be good, or whether it
be evil, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you;
that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.
 <a name="C42V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:7</font></a> It happened after ten
days, that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.  <a name="C42V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:8</font></a> Then called he Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the
people from the least even to the greatest,  <a name="C42V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:9</font></a> and said to them, Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your
supplication before him:  <a name="C42V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:10</font></a> If you will still abide in this
land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you,
and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought
on you.  <a name="C42V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:11</font></a> Don't be afraid
of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; don't be afraid of him,
says Yahweh: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his
hand.  <a name="C42V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:12</font></a> I will grant you
mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own
land.  <a name="C42V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:13</font></a> But if you say, We
will not dwell in this land; so that you don't obey the voice of Yahweh
your God,  <a name="C42V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:14</font></a> saying, No;
but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear
the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we
dwell:  <a name="C42V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:15</font></a> now therefore
hear you the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah: Thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel, If you indeed set your faces to enter into
Egypt, and go to sojourn there;  <a name="C42V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:16</font></a> then it shall happen, that the
sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and
the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow hard after you there
in Egypt; and there you shall die.  <a name="C42V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:17</font></a> So shall it be with all the men
who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by
the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall
remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.  <a name="C42V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:18</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you, when
you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object of horror, and an
astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no
more.  <a name="C42V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:19</font></a> Yahweh has spoken
concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don't you go into Egypt: know certainly
that I have testified to you this day.  <a name="C42V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:20</font></a> For you have dealt deceitfully
against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray
for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall
say, so declare to us, and we will do it:  <a name="C42V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:21</font></a> and I have this day declared it
to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything
for which he has sent me to you.  <a name="C42V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:22</font></a> Now therefore know certainly
that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in
the place where you desire to go to sojourn there.
<p> <a name="C43V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:1</font></a> It happened that, when
Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of
Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even
all these words,  <a name="C43V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:2</font></a> then
spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all
the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely: Yahweh our God has
not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;  <a name="C43V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:3</font></a> but Baruch the son of Neriah sets
you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they
may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.  <a name="C43V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:4</font></a> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and
all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn't obey the voice
of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah.  <a name="C43V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:5</font></a> But Johanan the son of Kareah,
and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who
were returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to sojourn
in the land of Judah;  <a name="C43V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:6</font></a> the
men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every
person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the
son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch
the son of Neriah;  <a name="C43V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:7</font></a> and
they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn't obey the voice of
Yahweh: and they came to Tahpanhes.  <a name="C43V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:8</font></a> Then came the word of Yahweh to
Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,  <a name="C43V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:9</font></a> Take great stones in your hand,
and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of
Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;  <a name="C43V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:10</font></a> and tell them, Thus says Yahweh
of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones
that I have hidden; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
 <a name="C43V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:11</font></a> He shall come, and shall
strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death <I>shall be given</I> to
death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the
sword to the sword.  <a name="C43V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:12</font></a> I
will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn
them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the
land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth
from there in peace.  <a name="C43V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:13</font></a> He
shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of
Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.
<p> <a name="C44V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:1</font></a> The word that came to
Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived
at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of
Pathros, saying,  <a name="C44V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:2</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that
I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah; and behold,
this day they are a desolation, and no man dwells therein,  <a name="C44V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:3</font></a> because of their wickedness which
they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn
incense, <I>and</I> to serve other gods, that they didn't know, neither
they, nor you, nor your fathers.  <a name="C44V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:4</font></a> However I sent to you all my
servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, don't
do this abominable thing that I hate.  <a name="C44V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:5</font></a> But they didn't listen, nor
inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to
other gods.  <a name="C44V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:6</font></a> Therefore my
wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of
Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate,
as it is this day.  <a name="C44V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:7</font></a> Therefore now thus says Yahweh,
the God of Armies, the God of Israel: Why commit you <I>this</I> great
evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and
suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;  <a name="C44V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:8</font></a> in that you provoke me to anger
with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of
Egypt, where you are gone to sojourn; that you may be cut off, and that
you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
 <a name="C44V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:9</font></a> Have you forgotten the
wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and
the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness
of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem?  <a name="C44V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:10</font></a> They are not humbled even to
this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my
statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.  <a name="C44V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:11</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for
evil, even to cut off all Judah.  <a name="C44V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:12</font></a> I will take the remnant of
Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn
there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they
fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall
die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine;
and they shall be an object of horror, <I>and</I> an astonishment, and a
curse, and a reproach.  <a name="C44V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:13</font></a> For I will punish those who
dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by
the famine, and by the pestilence;  <a name="C44V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:14</font></a> so that none of the remnant of
Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape
or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire
to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.
 <a name="C44V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:15</font></a> Then all the men who
knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who
stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of
Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,  <a name="C44V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:16</font></a> As for the word that you have
spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we will not listen to you.  <a name="C44V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:17</font></a> But we will certainly perform
every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the
queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done,
we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and
in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were
well, and saw no evil.  <a name="C44V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:18</font></a> But since we left off burning
incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her,
we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the
famine.  <a name="C44V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:19</font></a> When we burned
incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her,
did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her,
without our husbands?  <a name="C44V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:20</font></a> Then Jeremiah said to all the
people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given
him an answer, saying,  <a name="C44V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:21</font></a> The incense that you burned in
the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your
fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn't
Yahweh remember them, and didn't it come into his mind?  <a name="C44V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:22</font></a> so that Yahweh could no longer
bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations
which you have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and
an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
 <a name="C44V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:23</font></a> Because you have burned
incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed
the voice of Yahweh, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in
his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened to you, as it is this
day.  <a name="C44V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:24</font></a> Moreover Jeremiah
said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Yahweh, all
Judah who are in the land of Egypt:  <a name="C44V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:25</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, saying, You and your wives have both spoken with your
mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely
perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the
sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her: establish then your vows, and
perform your vows.  <a name="C44V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:26</font></a> Therefore hear the word of
Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by
my great name, says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the
mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord
Yahweh lives.  <a name="C44V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:27</font></a> Behold, I
watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who
are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine,
until there be an end of them.  <a name="C44V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:28</font></a> Those who escape the sword shall
return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and
all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.  <a name="C44V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:29</font></a> This shall be the sign to you,
says Yahweh, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that
my words shall surely stand against you for evil:  <a name="C44V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:30</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will
give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into
the hand of those who seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into
the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought
his life.
<p> <a name="C45V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:1</font></a> The message that
Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote
these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,  <a name="C45V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:2</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, to you, Baruch:  <a name="C45V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:3</font></a> You did say, Woe is me now! for
Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I
find no rest.  <a name="C45V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:4</font></a> You shall
tell him, Thus says Yahweh: Behold, that which I have built will I break
down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole
land.  <a name="C45V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:5</font></a> Seek you great
things for yourself? Don't seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on
all flesh, says Yahweh; but your life will I give to you for a prey in all
places where you go.
<p>
<p> <a name="C46V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.  <a name="C46V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:2</font></a> Of Egypt: concerning the army of
Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in
Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year
of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.  <a name="C46V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:3</font></a> Prepare you the buckler and
shield, and draw near to battle.  <a name="C46V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:4</font></a> Harness the horses, and get up,
you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put
on the coats of mail.  <a name="C46V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:5</font></a> Why
have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their
mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and don't look back:
terror is on every side, says Yahweh.  <a name="C46V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:6</font></a> Don't let the swift flee away,
nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they
stumbled and fallen.  <a name="C46V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:7</font></a> Who
is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the
rivers?  <a name="C46V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:8</font></a> Egypt rises up
like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he
says, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and
its inhabitants.  <a name="C46V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:9</font></a> Go up,
you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush
and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the
bow.  <a name="C46V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:10</font></a> For that day is
<I>a day</I> of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day of vengeance, that he
may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be
satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Yahweh of
Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
 <a name="C46V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:11</font></a> Go up into Gilead, and
take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines;
there is no healing for you.  <a name="C46V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:12</font></a> The nations have heard of your
shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled
against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.  <a name="C46V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:13</font></a> The word that Yahweh spoke to
Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come
and strike the land of Egypt.  <a name="C46V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:14</font></a> Declare you in Egypt, and
publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand
forth, and prepare you; for the sword has devoured around you.  <a name="C46V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:15</font></a> Why are your strong ones swept
away? they didn't stand, because Yahweh did drive them.  <a name="C46V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:16</font></a> He made many to stumble, yes,
they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our
own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.
 <a name="C46V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:17</font></a> They cried there,
Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass
by.  <a name="C46V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:18</font></a> As I live, says the
King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies, surely like Tabor among the
mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.  <a name="C46V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:19</font></a> You daughter who dwell in Egypt,
furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a
desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.  <a name="C46V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:20</font></a> Egypt is a very beautiful
heifer; <I>but</I> destruction out of the north is come, it is come.
 <a name="C46V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:21</font></a> Also her hired men in
the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned
back, they are fled away together, they didn't stand: for the day of their
calamity is come on them, the time of their visitation.  <a name="C46V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:22</font></a> The sound of it shall go like
the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with
axes, as wood cutters.  <a name="C46V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:23</font></a> They shall cut down her forest,
says Yahweh, though it can't be searched; because they are more than the
locusts, and are innumerable.  <a name="C46V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:24</font></a> The daughter of Egypt shall be
disappointed; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the
north.  <a name="C46V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:25</font></a> Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh,
and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust
in him:  <a name="C46V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:26</font></a> and I will
deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the
hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants;
and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Yahweh.
 <a name="C46V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:27</font></a> But don't be afraid you,
Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save
you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him
afraid.  <a name="C46V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:28</font></a> Don't be afraid
you, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I am with you: for I will make a
full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a
full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way
leave you unpunished.
<p>
<p> <a name="C47V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh
that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that
Pharaoh struck Gaza.  <a name="C47V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:2</font></a> Thus
says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an
overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein,
the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the
inhabitants of the land shall wail.  <a name="C47V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:3</font></a> At the noise of the stamping of
the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the
rumbling of his wheels, the fathers don't look back to their children for
feebleness of hands;  <a name="C47V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:4</font></a> because of the day that comes to
destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper
who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the
isle of Caphtor.  <a name="C47V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:5</font></a> Baldness
is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their
valley: how long will you cut yourself?  <a name="C47V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:6</font></a> You sword of Yahweh, how long
will it be before you be quiet? put up yourself into your scabbard; rest,
and be still.  <a name="C47V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:7</font></a> How can you
be quiet, seeing Yahweh has given you a command? Against Ashkelon, and
against the seashore, there has he appointed it.
<p>
<p> <a name="C48V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:1</font></a> Of Moab. Thus says
Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste;
Kiriathaim is disappointed, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken
down.  <a name="C48V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:2</font></a> The praise of Moab
is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let
us cut her off from being a nation. You also, Madmen, shall be brought to
silence: the sword shall pursue you.  <a name="C48V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:3</font></a> The sound of a cry from Horonaim,
desolation and great destruction!  <a name="C48V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:4</font></a> Moab is destroyed; her little
ones have caused a cry to be heard.  <a name="C48V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:5</font></a> For by the ascent of Luhith with
continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they
have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.  <a name="C48V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:6</font></a> Flee, save your lives, and be
like the heath in the wilderness.  <a name="C48V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:7</font></a> For, because you have trusted in
your works and in your treasures, you also shall be taken: and Chemosh
shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
 <a name="C48V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:8</font></a> The destroyer shall come
on every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and
the plain shall be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.  <a name="C48V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:9</font></a> Give wings to Moab, that she may
fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without
any to dwell therein.  <a name="C48V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:10</font></a> Cursed be he who does the work
of Yahweh negligently; and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from
blood.  <a name="C48V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:11</font></a> Moab has been at
ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been
emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity:
therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.  <a name="C48V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:12</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days
come, says Yahweh, that I will send to him those who pour off, and they
shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their
bottles in pieces.  <a name="C48V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:13</font></a> Moab
shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel
their confidence.  <a name="C48V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:14</font></a> How
say you, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?  <a name="C48V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:15</font></a> Moab is laid waste, and they are
gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the
slaughter, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C48V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:16</font></a> The calamity of Moab is near to
come, and his affliction hurries fast.  <a name="C48V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:17</font></a> All you who are around him,
bemoan him, and all you who know his name; say, How is the strong staff
broken, the beautiful rod!  <a name="C48V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:18</font></a> You daughter who dwells in
Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of
Moab is come up against you, he has destroyed your strongholds.  <a name="C48V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:19</font></a> Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by
the way, and watch: ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, What has
been done?  <a name="C48V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:20</font></a> Moab is
disappointed; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell you it by the
Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.  <a name="C48V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:21</font></a> Judgment is come on the plain
country, on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,  <a name="C48V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:22</font></a> and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and
on Beth Diblathaim,  <a name="C48V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:23</font></a> and
on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,  <a name="C48V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:24</font></a> and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah,
and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.  <a name="C48V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:25</font></a> The horn of Moab is cut off, and
his arm is broken, says Yahweh.  <a name="C48V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:26</font></a> Make you him drunken; for he
magnified himself against Yahweh: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and
he also shall be in derision.  <a name="C48V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:27</font></a> For wasn't Israel a derision to
you? was he found among thieves? for as often as you speak of him, you wag
the head.  <a name="C48V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:28</font></a> You
inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like
the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.  <a name="C48V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:29</font></a> We have heard of the pride of
Moab, <I>that</I> he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his
arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.  <a name="C48V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:30</font></a> I know his wrath, says Yahweh,
that it is nothing; his boastings have worked nothing.  <a name="C48V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:31</font></a> Therefore will I wail for Moab;
yes, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir Heres shall they
mourn.  <a name="C48V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:32</font></a> With more than
the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah: your branches
passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: on your summer
fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen.  <a name="C48V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:33</font></a> Gladness and joy is taken away
from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine
to cease from the wine presses: none shall tread with shouting; the
shouting shall be no shouting.  <a name="C48V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:34</font></a> From the cry of Heshbon even to
Elealeh, even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to
Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall
become desolate.  <a name="C48V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:35</font></a> Moreover I will cause to cease
in Moab, says Yahweh, him who offers in the high place, and him who burns
incense to his gods.  <a name="C48V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:36</font></a> Therefore my heart sounds for
Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres:
therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished.  <a name="C48V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:37</font></a> For every head is bald, and
every beard clipped: on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist
sackcloth.  <a name="C48V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:38</font></a> On all the
housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where; for
I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights, says Yahweh.
 <a name="C48V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:39</font></a> How is it broken down!
<I>how</I> do they wail! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall
Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.  <a name="C48V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:40</font></a> For thus says Yahweh: Behold, he
shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.
 <a name="C48V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:41</font></a> Kerioth is taken, and
the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at
that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  <a name="C48V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:42</font></a> Moab shall be destroyed from
being a people, because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.  <a name="C48V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:43</font></a> Fear, and the pit, and the
snare, are on you, inhabitant of Moab, says Yahweh.  <a name="C48V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:44</font></a> He who flees from the fear shall
fall into the pit; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the
snare: for I will bring on him, even on Moab, the year of their
visitation, says Yahweh.  <a name="C48V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:45</font></a> Those who fled stand without
strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of
Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner
of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.  <a name="C48V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:46</font></a> Woe to you, O Moab! the people
of Chemosh is undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your
daughters into captivity.  <a name="C48V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:47</font></a> Yet will I bring back the
captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Yahweh. Thus far is the
judgment of Moab.
<p>
<p> <a name="C49V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:1</font></a> Of the children of
Ammon. Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does
Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in its cities?  <a name="C49V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:2</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days come,
says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah
of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her
daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who
did possess him, says Yahweh.  <a name="C49V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:3</font></a> Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid
waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and
run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity,
his priests and his princes together.  <a name="C49V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:4</font></a> Why glory you in the valleys,
your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? who trusted in her treasures,
<I>saying</I>, Who shall come to me?  <a name="C49V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:5</font></a> Behold, I will bring a fear on
you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, from all who are around you; and you
shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to
gather together the fugitives.  <a name="C49V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:6</font></a> But afterward I will bring back
the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.  <a name="C49V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:7</font></a> Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of
Armies: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent?
is their wisdom vanished?  <a name="C49V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:8</font></a> Flee you, turn back, dwell in the
depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on
him, the time that I shall visit him.  <a name="C49V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:9</font></a> If grape gatherers came to you,
would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn't
they destroy until they had enough?  <a name="C49V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:10</font></a> But I have made Esau bare, I
have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide
himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and
he is no more.  <a name="C49V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:11</font></a> Leave
your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows
trust in me.  <a name="C49V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:12</font></a> For thus
says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain to drink of the cup
shall certainly drink; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished?
you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.  <a name="C49V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:13</font></a> For I have sworn by myself, says
Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and
a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.  <a name="C49V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:14</font></a> I have heard news from Yahweh,
and an ambassador is sent among the nations, <I>saying</I>, Gather
yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
 <a name="C49V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:15</font></a> For, behold, I have made
you small among the nations, and despised among men.  <a name="C49V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:16</font></a> As for your terror, the pride of
your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high
as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.  <a name="C49V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:17</font></a> Edom shall become an
astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall
hiss at all its plagues.  <a name="C49V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:18</font></a> As in the overthrow of Sodom and
Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell
there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.  <a name="C49V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:19</font></a> Behold, he shall come up like a
lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I
will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will
I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and
who is the shepherd who will stand before me?  <a name="C49V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:20</font></a> Therefore hear the counsel of
Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has
purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them
away, <I>even</I> the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their
habitation desolate over them.  <a name="C49V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:21</font></a> The earth trembles at the noise
of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the <a
href="#N1">Red Sea</a>.  <a name="C49V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:22</font></a> Behold, he shall come up and fly
as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of
the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her
pangs.  <a name="C49V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:23</font></a> Of Damascus.
Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are
melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can't be quiet.  <a name="C49V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:24</font></a> Damascus has grown feeble, she
turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and
sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.  <a name="C49V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:25</font></a> How is the city of praise not
forsaken, the city of my joy?  <a name="C49V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:26</font></a> Therefore her young men shall
fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in
that day, says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C49V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:27</font></a> I will kindle a fire in the wall
of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.  <a name="C49V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:28</font></a> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of
Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh:
Arise you, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.  <a name="C49V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:29</font></a> Their tents and their flocks
shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and
all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on
every side!  <a name="C49V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:30</font></a> Flee you,
wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says
Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,
and has conceived a purpose against you.  <a name="C49V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:31</font></a> Arise, go up to a nation that is
at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates
nor bars, that dwell alone.  <a name="C49V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:32</font></a> Their camels shall be a booty,
and the multitude of their livestock a spoil: and I will scatter to all
winds those who have the corners <I>of their hair</I> cut off; and I will
bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.  <a name="C49V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:33</font></a> Hazor shall be a dwelling place
of jackals, a desolation forever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall
any son of man sojourn therein.  <a name="C49V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:34</font></a> The word of Yahweh that came to
Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,  <a name="C49V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:35</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies:
Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.  <a name="C49V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:36</font></a> On Elam will I bring the four
winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all
those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall
not come.  <a name="C49V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:37</font></a> I will cause
Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their
life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh;
and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;  <a name="C49V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:38</font></a> and I will set my throne in
Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.  <a name="C49V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:39</font></a> But it shall happen in the
latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.
<p>
<p> <a name="C50V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:1</font></a> The word that Yahweh
spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by
Jeremiah the prophet.  <a name="C50V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:2</font></a> Declare you among the nations and
publish, and set up a standard; publish, and don't conceal: say, Babylon
is taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images are
disappointed, her idols are dismayed.  <a name="C50V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:3</font></a> For out of the north there comes
up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none
shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.
 <a name="C50V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:4</font></a> In those days, and in
that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the
children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall
seek Yahweh their God.  <a name="C50V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:5</font></a> They shall inquire concerning
Zion with their faces turned toward it, <I>saying</I>, Come you, and join
yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that shall not be
forgotten.  <a name="C50V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:6</font></a> My people have
been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have
turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill;
they have forgotten their resting place.  <a name="C50V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:7</font></a> All who found them have devoured
them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have
sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the
hope of their fathers.  <a name="C50V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:8</font></a> Flee out of the midst of Babylon,
and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats
before the flocks.  <a name="C50V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:9</font></a> For,
behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of
great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in
array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as
of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.  <a name="C50V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:10</font></a> Chaldea shall be a prey: all who
prey on her shall be satisfied, says Yahweh.  <a name="C50V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:11</font></a> Because you are glad, because
you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a
heifer that treads out <I>the grain</I>, and neigh as strong horses;
 <a name="C50V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:12</font></a> your mother shall be
utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall be confounded: behold, she
shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
 <a name="C50V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:13</font></a> Because of the wrath of
Yahweh she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate:
everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her
plagues.  <a name="C50V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:14</font></a> Set yourselves
in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at
her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against Yahweh.  <a name="C50V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:15</font></a> Shout against her all around:
she has submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown
down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on her; as she has
done, do to her.  <a name="C50V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:16</font></a> Cut off
the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of
harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his
people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land.  <a name="C50V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:17</font></a> Israel is a hunted sheep; the
lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and
now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.  <a name="C50V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:18</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and
his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.  <a name="C50V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:19</font></a> I will bring Israel again to his
pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be
satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.  <a name="C50V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:20</font></a> In those days, and in that time,
says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall
be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.  <a name="C50V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:21</font></a> Go up against the land of
Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and
utterly destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I
have commanded you.  <a name="C50V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:22</font></a> A
sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.  <a name="C50V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:23</font></a> How is the hammer of the whole
earth cut apart and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the
nations!  <a name="C50V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:24</font></a> I have laid a
snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren't aware: you
are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.
 <a name="C50V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:25</font></a> Yahweh has opened his
armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the
Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work <I>to do</I> in the land of the
Chaldeans.  <a name="C50V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:26</font></a> Come against
her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps,
and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.  <a name="C50V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:27</font></a> Kill all her bulls; let them go
down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of
their visitation.  <a name="C50V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:28</font></a> The
voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare
in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.
 <a name="C50V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:29</font></a> Call together the
archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her
all around; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work;
according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud
against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.  <a name="C50V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:30</font></a> Therefore shall her young men
fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in
that day, says Yahweh.  <a name="C50V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:31</font></a> Behold, I am against you, you
proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies; for your day is come, the time
that I will visit you.  <a name="C50V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:32</font></a> The proud one shall stumble and
fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities,
and it shall devour all who are around him.  <a name="C50V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:33</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The
children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and
all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
 <a name="C50V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:34</font></a> Their Redeemer is
strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name: he will thoroughly plead their
cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of
Babylon.  <a name="C50V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:35</font></a> A sword is on
the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her
princes, and on her wise men.  <a name="C50V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:36</font></a> A sword is on the boasters, and
they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be
dismayed.  <a name="C50V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:37</font></a> A sword is on
their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are
in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her
treasures, and they shall be robbed.  <a name="C50V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:38</font></a> A drought is on her waters, and
they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are
mad over idols.  <a name="C50V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:39</font></a> Therefore the wild animals of
the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall
dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it
be lived in from generation to generation.  <a name="C50V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:40</font></a> As when God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell
there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.  <a name="C50V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:41</font></a> Behold, a people comes from the
north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the
uttermost parts of the earth.  <a name="C50V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:42</font></a> They lay hold on bow and spear;
they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and
they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle,
against you, daughter of Babylon.  <a name="C50V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:43</font></a> The king of Babylon has heard
the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him,
<I>and</I> pangs as of a woman in travail.  <a name="C50V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:44</font></a> Behold, <I>the enemy</I> shall
come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong
habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is
chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will
appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?
 <a name="C50V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:45</font></a> Therefore hear the
counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes,
that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall
drag them away, <I>even</I> the little ones of the flock; surely he shall
make their habitation desolate over them.  <a name="C50V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:46</font></a> At the noise of the taking of
Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.
<p>
<p> <a name="C51V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:1</font></a> Thus says Yahweh:
Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against those who dwell in
Lebkamai, a destroying wind.  <a name="C51V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:2</font></a> I will send to Babylon strangers,
who shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of
trouble they shall be against her around.  <a name="C51V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:3</font></a> Against <I>him who</I> bends let
the archer bend his bow, and against <I>him who</I> lifts himself up in
his coat of mail: and don't you spare her young men; destroy you utterly
all her army.  <a name="C51V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:4</font></a> They shall
fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her
streets.  <a name="C51V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:5</font></a> For Israel is
not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh of Armies; though their
land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.  <a name="C51V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:6</font></a> Flee out of the midst of Babylon,
and save every man his life; don't be cut off in her iniquity: for it is
the time of Yahweh's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
 <a name="C51V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:7</font></a> Babylon has been a golden
cup in Yahweh's hand, who made all the earth drunken: the nations have
drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.  <a name="C51V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:8</font></a> Babylon is suddenly fallen and
destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be
healed.  <a name="C51V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:9</font></a> We would have
healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go everyone
into his own country; for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up
even to the skies.  <a name="C51V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:10</font></a> Yahweh has brought forth our
righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our
God.  <a name="C51V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:11</font></a> Make sharp the
arrows; hold firm the shields: Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the
kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it:
for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.  <a name="C51V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:12</font></a> Set up a standard against the
walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the
ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke
concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.  <a name="C51V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:13</font></a> You who dwell on many waters,
abundant in treasures, your end is come, the measure of your covetousness.
 <a name="C51V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:14</font></a> Yahweh of Armies has
sworn by himself, <I>saying</I>, Surely I will fill you with men, as with
the canker worm; and they shall lift up a shout against you.  <a name="C51V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:15</font></a> He has made the earth by his
power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his
understanding has he stretched out the heavens:  <a name="C51V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:16</font></a> when he utters his voice, there
is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend
from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain, and brings
forth the wind out of his treasuries.  <a name="C51V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:17</font></a> Every man is become brutish
<I>and is</I> without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his
image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
 <a name="C51V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:18</font></a> They are vanity, a work
of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <a name="C51V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:19</font></a> The portion of Jacob is not like
these; for he is the former of all things; and <I>Israel</I> is the tribe
of his inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is his name.  <a name="C51V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:20</font></a> You are my battle axe and
weapons of war: and with you will I break in pieces the nations; and with
you will I destroy kingdoms;  <a name="C51V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:21</font></a> and with you will I break in
pieces the horse and his rider;  <a name="C51V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:22</font></a> and with you will I break in
pieces the chariot and him who rides therein; and with you will I break in
pieces man and woman; and with you will I break in pieces the old man and
the youth; and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the
virgin;  <a name="C51V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:23</font></a> and with you
will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with you will I
break in pieces the farmer and his yoke <I>of oxen</I>; and with you will
I break in pieces governors and deputies.  <a name="C51V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:24</font></a> I will render to Babylon and to
all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion
in your sight, says Yahweh.  <a name="C51V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:25</font></a> Behold, I am against you,
destroying mountain, says Yahweh, which destroys all the earth; and I will
stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will
make you a burnt mountain.  <a name="C51V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:26</font></a> They shall not take of you a
stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate
for ever, says Yahweh.  <a name="C51V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:27</font></a> Set up a standard in the land,
blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call
together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint
a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker
worm.  <a name="C51V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:28</font></a> Prepare against
her the nations, the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its
deputies, and all the land of their dominion.  <a name="C51V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:29</font></a> The land trembles and is in
pain; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand, to make the
land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.  <a name="C51V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:30</font></a> The mighty men of Babylon have
forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has
failed; they are become as women: her dwelling places are set on fire; her
bars are broken.  <a name="C51V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:31</font></a> One
runner will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to
show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:  <a name="C51V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:32</font></a> and the passages are seized, and
the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.
 <a name="C51V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:33</font></a> For thus says Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing
floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of
harvest shall come for her.  <a name="C51V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:34</font></a> Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty
vessel, he has, like a monster, swallowed me up, he has filled his maw
with my delicacies; he has cast me out.  <a name="C51V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:35</font></a> The violence done to me and to
my flesh be on Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be
on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.  <a name="C51V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:36</font></a> Therefore thus says Yahweh:
Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will
dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.  <a name="C51V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:37</font></a> Babylon shall become heaps, a
dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without
inhabitant.  <a name="C51V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:38</font></a> They shall
roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions' cubs.  <a name="C51V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:39</font></a> When they are heated, I will
make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and
sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says Yahweh.  <a name="C51V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:40</font></a> I will bring them down like
lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.  <a name="C51V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:41</font></a> How is Sheshach taken! and the
praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among
the nations!  <a name="C51V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:42</font></a> The sea is
come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.
 <a name="C51V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:43</font></a> Her cities are become a
desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells,
neither does any son of man pass thereby.  <a name="C51V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:44</font></a> I will execute judgment on Bel
in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has
swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more to him: yes, the
wall of Babylon shall fall.  <a name="C51V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:45</font></a> My people, go you out of the
midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of
Yahweh.  <a name="C51V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:46</font></a> Don't let your
heart faint, neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land;
for news shall come one year, and after that in another year <I>shall
come</I> news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.  <a name="C51V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:47</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days
come, that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon; and
her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the
midst of her.  <a name="C51V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:48</font></a> Then the
heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over
Babylon; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north, says Yahweh.
 <a name="C51V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:49</font></a> As Babylon has caused
the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the
land.  <a name="C51V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:50</font></a> You who have
escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still; remember Yahweh from afar,
and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <a name="C51V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:51</font></a> We are confounded, because we
have heard reproach; confusion has covered our faces: for strangers are
come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh's house.  <a name="C51V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:52</font></a> Therefore, behold, the days
come, says Yahweh, that I will execute judgment on her engraved images;
and through all her land the wounded shall groan.  <a name="C51V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:53</font></a> Though Babylon should mount up
to the sky, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet
from me shall destroyers come to her, says Yahweh.  <a name="C51V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:54</font></a> The sound of a cry from Babylon,
and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!  <a name="C51V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:55</font></a> For Yahweh lays Babylon waste,
and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many
waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:  <a name="C51V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:56</font></a> for the destroyer is come on
her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken
in pieces; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.
 <a name="C51V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:57</font></a> I will make drunk her
princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty
men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up, says the
King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C51V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:58</font></a> Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The
broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates
shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the
nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.  <a name="C51V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:59</font></a> The word which Jeremiah the
prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he
went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his
reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.  <a name="C51V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:60</font></a> Jeremiah wrote in a book all the
evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written
concerning Babylon.  <a name="C51V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:61</font></a> Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When
you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,  <a name="C51V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:62</font></a> and say, Yahweh, you have spoken
concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein,
neither man nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.  <a name="C51V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:63</font></a> It shall be, when you have made
an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast
it into the midst of the Euphrates:  <a name="C51V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">51:64</font></a> and you shall say, Thus shall
Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will
bring on her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
<p>
<p> <a name="C52V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:1</font></a> Zedekiah was
twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah
of Libnah.  <a name="C52V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:2</font></a> He did that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had
done.  <a name="C52V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:3</font></a> For through the
anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast
them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
 <a name="C52V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:4</font></a> It happened in the ninth
year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against
Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round
about.  <a name="C52V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:5</font></a> So the city was
besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.  <a name="C52V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:6</font></a> In the fourth month, in the ninth
day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no
bread for the people of the land.  <a name="C52V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:7</font></a> Then a breach was made in the
city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night
by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's
garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they
went toward the Arabah.  <a name="C52V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:8</font></a> But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho;
and all his army was scattered from him.  <a name="C52V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:9</font></a> Then they took the king, and
carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and
he gave judgment on him.  <a name="C52V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:10</font></a> The king of Babylon killed the
sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah
in Riblah.  <a name="C52V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:11</font></a> He put out
the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and
carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.
 <a name="C52V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:12</font></a> Now in the fifth month,
in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:  <a name="C52V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:13</font></a> and he burned the house of
Yahweh, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every
great house, burned he with fire.  <a name="C52V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:14</font></a> All the army of the Chaldeans,
who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of
Jerusalem all around.  <a name="C52V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:15</font></a> Then Nebuzaradan the captain of
the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the
residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away,
who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.  <a name="C52V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:16</font></a> But Nebuzaradan the captain of
the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and
farmers.  <a name="C52V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:17</font></a> The pillars of
brass that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea
that were in the house of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and
carried all the brass of them to Babylon.  <a name="C52V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:18</font></a> The pots also, and the shovels,
and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of
brass with which they ministered, took they away.  <a name="C52V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:19</font></a> The cups, and the fire pans, and
the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the
bowls--that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in
silver,--the captain of the guard took away.  <a name="C52V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:20</font></a> The two pillars, the one sea,
and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon
had made for the house of Yahweh. The brass of all these vessels was
without weight.  <a name="C52V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:21</font></a> As for
the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line
of twelve cubits did compass it; and its thickness was four fingers: it
was hollow.  <a name="C52V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:22</font></a> A capital of
brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with
network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of brass: and the
second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.  <a name="C52V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:23</font></a> There were ninety-six
pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the
network all around.  <a name="C52V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:24</font></a> The
captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the
second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:  <a name="C52V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:25</font></a> and out of the city he took an
officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw
the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain
of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the
people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.  <a name="C52V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:26</font></a> Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
 <a name="C52V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:27</font></a> The king of Babylon
struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So
Judah was carried away captive out of his land.  <a name="C52V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:28</font></a> This is the people whom
Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand
twenty-three Jews;  <a name="C52V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:29</font></a> in
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;  <a name="C52V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:30</font></a> in the three and twentieth year
of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away
captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were
four thousand and six hundred.  <a name="C52V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:31</font></a> It happened in the seven and
thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the
twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that
Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the <I>first</I> year of his reign,
lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out
of prison;  <a name="C52V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:32</font></a> and he spoke
kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were
with him in Babylon,  <a name="C52V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:33</font></a> and
changed his prison garments. <I>Jehoiachin</I> ate bread before him
continually all the days of his life:  <a name="C52V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">52:34</font></a> and for his allowance, there was
a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a
portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
