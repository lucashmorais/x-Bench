<p><i>In the course of the following production, the Reader will meet with
several references to a Plan of Paris, which it had been intended to prefix to

two countries, in consequence of which the copies for the whole of the Edition
have been detained at Calais, it is hoped that this apology will be accepted
for the omission.</i></p>

<p /><p /><p /><h2><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>
<p>On ushering into the world a literary production, custom has established
that its parent should give some account of his offspring. Indeed, this becomes
the more necessary at the present moment, as the short-lived peace, which gave
birth to the following sheets, had already ceased before they were entirely
printed; and the war in which England and France are now engaged, is of a
nature calculated not only to rouse all the energy and ancient spirit of my
countrymen, but also to revive their prejudices, and inflame their passions, in
a degree proportionate to the enemy's boastful and provoking menace.</p>
<p>I therefore premise that those who may be tempted to take up this
publication, merely with a view of seeking aliment for their enmity, will, in
more respects than one, probably find themselves disappointed. The two nations
were not rivals in arms, but in the arts and sciences, at the time these
letters were written, and committed to the press; consequently, they have no
relation whatever to the present contest. Nevertheless, as they refer to
subjects which manifest the indefatigable activity of the French in the
accomplishment of any grand object, such parts may, perhaps, furnish hints that
may not be altogether unimportant at this momentous crisis.</p>
<p>The plan most generally adhered to throughout this work, being detailed in
<a href="#let05">LETTER V</a>, a repetition of it here would be superfluous;
and the principal matters to which the work itself relates, are specified in
the title. I now come to the point.</p>
<p>A long residence in France, and particularly in the capital, having afforded
me an opportunity of becoming tolerably well acquainted with its state before
the revolution, my curiosity was strongly excited to ascertain the changes
which that political phenomenon might have effected. I accordingly availed
myself of the earliest dawn of peace to cross the water, and visit Paris. Since
I had left that city in 1789-90, a powerful monarchy, established on a
possession of fourteen centuries, and on that sort of national prosperity which
seemed to challenge the approbation of future ages, had been destroyed by the
force of opinion which, like, a subterraneous fire, consumed its very
foundations, and plunged the nation into a sea of troubles, in which it was,
for several years, tossed about, amid the wreck of its greatness.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon of which antiquity affords no parallel; and it has
produced a rapid succession of events so extraordinary as almost to exceed
belief.</p>
<p>It is not the crimes to which it has given birth that will be thought
improbable: the history of revolutions, as well ancient as modern, furnishes
but too many examples of them; and few have been committed, the traces of which
are not to be found in the countries where the imagination of the multitude has
been exalted by strong and new ideas, respecting Liberty and Equality. But what
posterity will find difficult to believe, is the agitation of men's minds, and
the effervescence of the passions, carried to such a pitch, as to stamp the
French revolution with a character bordering on the marvellous&mdash;Yes;
posterity will have reason to be astonished at the facility with which the
human mind can be modified and made to pass from one extreme to another; at the
suddenness, in short, with which the ideas and manners of the French were
changed; so powerful, on the one hand, is the ascendency of certain
imaginations; and, on the other, so great is the weakness of the vulgar!</p>
<p>It is in the recollection of most persons, that the agitation of the public
mind in France was such, for a while, that, after having overthrown the
monarchy and its supports; rendered private property insecure; and destroyed
individual freedom; it threatened to invade foreign countries, at the same time
pushing before it Liberty, that first blessing of man, when it is founded on
laws, and the most dangerous of chimeras, when it is without rule or
restraint.</p>
<p>The greater part of the causes which excited this general commotion, existed
before the assembly of the States-General in 1789. It is therefore important to
take a mental view of the moral and political situation of France at that
period, and to follow, in imagination at least, the chain of ideas, passions,
and errors, which, having dissolved the ties of society, and worn out the
springs of government, led the nation by gigantic strides into the most
complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Without enumerating the different authorities which successively ruled in
France after the fall of the throne, it appears no less essential to remind the
reader that, in this general disorganization, the inhabitants themselves,
though breathing the same air, scarcely knew that they belonged to the same
nation. The altars overthrown; all the ancient institutions annihilated; new
festivals and ceremonies introduced; factious demagogues honoured with an
apotheosis; their busts exposed to public veneration; men and cities changing
names; a portion of the people infected with atheism, and disguised in the
livery of guilt and folly; all this, and more, exercised the reflection of the
well-disposed in a manner the most painful. In a word, though France was
peopled with the same individuals, it seemed inhabited by a new nation,
entirely different from the old one in its government, its creed, its
principles, its manners, and even its customs.</p>
<p>War itself assumed a new face. Every thing relating to it became
extraordinary: the number of the combatants, the manner of recruiting the
armies, and the means of providing supplies for them; the manufacture of
powder, cannon, and muskets; the ardour, impetuosity, and forced marches of the
troops; their extortions, their successes, and their reverses; the choice of
the generals, and the superior talents of some of them, together with the
springs, by which these enormous bodies of armed men were moved and directed,
were equally new and astonishing.</p>
<p>History tells us that in poor countries, where nothing inflames cupidity and
ambition, the love alone of the public good causes changes to be tried in the
government; and that those changes derange not the ordinary course of society;
whereas, among rich nations, corrupted by luxury, revolutions are always
effected through secret motives of jealousy and interest; because there are
great places to be usurped, and great fortunes to be invaded. In France, the
revolution covered the country with ruins, tears, and blood, because means were
not to be found to moderate in the people that <i>revolutionary spirit</i>
which parches, in the bud, the promised fruits of liberty, when its violence is
not repressed.</p>
<p>Few persons were capable of keeping pace with the rapid progress of the
revolution. Those who remained behind were considered as guilty of desertion.
The authors of the first constitution were accused of being <i>royalists</i>;
the old partisans of republicanism were punished as <i>moderates</i>; the
land-owners, as <i>aristocrates</i>; the monied men, as <i>corrupters</i>; the
bankers and financiers, as <i>blood-suckers</i>; the shop-keepers, as
<i>promoters of famine</i>; and the newsmongers, as <i>alarmists</i>. The
factious themselves, in short, were alternately proscribed, as soon as they
ceased to belong to the ruling faction.</p>
<p>In this state of things, society became a prey to the most baneful passions.
Mistrust entered every heart; friendship had no attraction; relationship, no
tie; and men's minds, hardened by the habit of misfortune, or overwhelmed by
fear, no longer opened to pity.</p>
<p>Terror compressed every imagination; and the revolutionary government,
exercising it to its fullest extent, struck off a prodigious number of heads,
filled the prisons with victims, and continued to corrupt the morals of the
nation by staining it with crimes.</p>
<p>But all things have an end. The tyrants fell; the dungeons were thrown open;
numberless victims emerged from them; and France seemed to recover new life;
but still bewildered by the <i>revolutionary spirit</i>, wasted by the
concealed poison of anarchy, exhausted by her innumerable sacrifices, and
almost paralyzed by her own convulsions, she made but impotent efforts for the
enjoyment of liberty and justice. Taxes became more burdensome; commerce was
annihilated; industry, without aliment; paper-money, without value; and specie,
without circulation. However, while the French nation was degraded at home by
this series of evils, it was respected abroad through the rare merit of some of
its generals, the splendour of its victories, and the bravery of its
soldiers.</p>
<p>During these transactions, there was formed in the public mind that moral
resistance which destroys not governments by violence, but undermines them.
<a name="introfr1"></a>The intestine commotions were increasing; the conquests
of the French were invaded; their enemies were already on their frontiers; and
the division which had broken out between the Directory and the Legislative
Body, again threatened France with a total dissolution, when a man of
extraordinary character and talents had the boldness to seize the reins of
authority, and stop the further progress of the
revolution.[<a href="#introf1">1</a>] Taking at the full the tide which leads
on to fortune, he at once changed the face of affairs, not only within the
limits of the Republic, but throughout Europe. Yet, after all their triumphs,
the French have the mortification to have failed in gaining that for which they
first took up arms, and for which they have maintained so long and so obstinate
a struggle.</p>
<p>When a strong mound has been broken down, the waters whose amassed volume it
opposed, rush forward, and, in their impetuous course, spread afar terror and
devastation. On visiting the scene where this has occurred, we naturally cast
our eyes in every direction, to discover the mischief which they have
occasioned by their irruption; so, then, on reaching the grand theatre of the
French revolution, did I look about for the traces of the havock it had left
behind; but, like a river which had regained its level, and flowed again in its
natural bed, this political torrent had subsided, and its ravages were repaired
in a manner the most surprising.</p>
<p>However, at the particular request of an estimable friend, I have
endeavoured to draw the contrast which, in 1789-90 and 1801-2, Paris presented
to the eye of an impartial observer. In this arduous attempt I have not the
vanity to flatter myself that I have been successful, though I have not
hesitated to lay under contribution every authority likely to promote my
object. The state of the French capital, before the revolution, I have
delineated from the notes I had myself collected on the spot, and for which
purpose I was, at that time, under the necessity of consulting almost as many
books as Don Quixote read on knight-errantry; but the authors from whom I have
chiefly borrowed, are St. FOIX, MERCIER, DULAURE, PUJOULX, and BIOT.</p>
<p>My invariable aim has been to relate, <i>sine ira nec studio</i>, such facts
and circumstances as have come to my knowledge, and to render to every one that
justice which I should claim for myself. After a revolution which has trenched
on so many opposite interests, the reader cannot be surprised, if information,
derived from such a variety of sources, should sometimes seem to bear the
character of party-spirit. Should this appear <i>on the face of the record</i>,
I can only say that I have avoided entering into politics, in order that no
bias of that sort might lead me to discolour or distort the truths I have had
occasion to state; and I have totally rejected those communications which, from
their tone of bitterness, personality, and virulence, might be incompatible
with the general tenour of an impartial production.</p>
<p>Till the joint approbation of some competent judges, who visited the French
capital after having perused, in manuscript, several of these letters, had
stamped on them a comparative degree of value, no one could think more lightly
of them than the author. Urged repeatedly to produce them to the public, I have
yielded with reluctance, and in the fullest confidence that, notwithstanding
the recent change of circumstances, a liberal construction will be put on my
sentiments and motives. I have taken care that my account of the national
establishments in France should be perfectly correct; and, in fact, I have been
favoured with the principal information it contains by their respective
directors. In regard to the other topics on which I have touched, I have not
failed to consult the best authorities, even in matters, which, however
trifling in themselves, acquire a relative importance, from being illustrative
of some of the many-coloured effects of a revolution, which has humbled the
pride of many, deranged the calculations of all, disappointed the hopes of not
a few, and deceived those even by whom it had been engendered and
conducted.</p>
<p>Yet, whatever pains I have taken to be strictly impartial, it cannot be
denied that, in publishing a work of this description at a time when the
self-love of most men is mortified, and their resentment awakened, I run no
small risk of displeasing all parties, because I attach myself to none, but
find them all more or less deserving of censure. Without descending either to
flattery or calumny, I speak both well and ill of the French, because I copy
nature, and neither draw an imaginary portrait, nor write a systematic
narrative. If I have occasionally given vent to my indignation in glancing at
the excesses of the revolution, I have not withheld my tribute of applause from
those institutions, which, being calculated to benefit mankind by the
gratuitous diffusion of knowledge, would reflect honour on any nation.
<a name="introfr2"></a>In other respects, I have not been unmindful of that
excellent precept of TACITUS, in which he observes that "The principal duty of
the historian is to rescue from oblivion virtuous actions, and to make bad men
dread infamy and posterity for what they have said and
done."[<a href="#introf2">2</a>]</p>
<p>In stating facts, it is frequently necessary to support them by a relation
of particular circumstances, which may corroborate them in an unquestionable
manner. Feeling this truth, I have some times introduced myself on my canvass,
merely to shew that I am not an ideal traveller. I mean one of those pleasant
fellows who travel post in their elbow-chair, sail round the world on a map
suspended to one side of their room, cross the seas with a pocket-compass lying
on their table, experience a shipwreck by their fireside, make their escape
when it scorches their shins, and land on a desert island in their <i>robe de
chambre</i> and slippers.</p>
<p>I have, therefore, here and there mentioned names, time, and place, to prove
that, <i>bonâ fide</i>, I went to Paris immediately after the ratification of
the preliminary treaty. To banish uniformity in my description of that
metropolis, I have, as much as possible, varied my subjects. Fashions,
sciences, absurdities, anecdotes, education, fêtes, useful arts, places of
amusement, music, learned and scientific institutions, inventions, public
buildings, industry, agriculture, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. being all jumbled
together in my brain, I have thence drawn them, like tickets from a lottery;
and it will not, I trust, be deemed presumptuous in me to indulge a hope that,
in proportion to the blanks, there will be found no inadequate number of
prizes.</p>
<p>I have pointed out the immense advantages which France is likely to derive
from her Schools for Public Services, and other establishments of striking
utility, such as the <i>Dépôt de la Guerre</i> and the <i>Dépôt de la
Marine</i>, in order that the British government may be prompted to form
institutions, which, if not exactly similar, may at least answer the same
purpose. Instead of copying the French in objects of fickleness and frivolity,
why not borrow from them what is really deserving of imitation?</p>
<p>It remains for me to observe, by way of stimulating the ambition of British
genius, that, in France, the arts and sciences are now making a rapid and
simultaneous progress; first, because the revolution has made them popular in
that country; and, secondly, because they are daily connected by new ties,
which, in a great measure, render them inseparable. Facts are there recurred
to, less with a view to draw from them immediate applications than to develop
the truths resulting from them. The first step is from these facts to their
most simple consequences, which are little more than bare assertions. From
these the <i>savans</i> proceed to others more minute, till, at length, by
imperceptible degrees, they arrive at the most abstracted generalities. With
them, method is an induction incessantly verified by experiment. Whence, it
gives to human intelligence, not wings which lead it astray, but reins which
guide it. United by this common philosophy, the sciences and arts in France
advance together; and the progress made by one of them serves to promote that
of the rest. There, the men who profess them, considering that their knowledge
belongs not to themselves alone, not to their country only, but to all mankind,
are continually striving to increase the mass of public knowledge. This they
regard as a real duty, which they are proud to discharge; thus treading in the
steps of the most memorable men of past ages.</p>
<p>Then, while the more unlearned and unskilled among us are emulating the
patriotic enthusiasm of the French in volunteering, as they did, to resist
invasion, let our men of science and genius exert themselves not to be
surpassed by the industrious <i>savans</i> and artists of that nation; but let
them act on the principle inculcated by the following sublime idea of our
illustrious countryman, the founder of modern philosophy. "It may not be
amiss," says BACON, "to point out three different kinds, and, as it were,
degrees of ambition. The first, that of those who desire to enhance, in their
own country, the power they arrogate to themselves: this kind of ambition is
both vulgar and degenerate. The second, that of those who endeavour to extend
the power and domination of their country, over the whole of the human race: in
this kind there is certainly a greater dignity, though; at the same time, no
less a share of cupidity. But should any one strive to restore and extend the
power and domination of mankind over the universality of things, unquestionably
such an ambition, (if it can be so denominated) would be more reasonable and
dignified than the others. <a name="introfr3"></a>Now, the empire of man, over
things, has its foundation exclusively in the arts and sciences; for it is only
by an obedience to her laws, that Nature can be
commanded."[<a href="#introf3">3</a>]</p>
<p>LONDON, June 10, 1803.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="introf1">Footnote 1</a>: Of two things, we are left to
believe one. BONAPARTE either was or was not invited to put himself at the head
of the government of France. It is not probable that the Directory should send
for him from Egypt, in order to say to him: "we are fools and drivelers, unfit
to conduct the affairs of the nation; so turn us out of office, and seat
yourself in our place." Nevertheless, they might have hoped to preserve their
tottering authority through his support. Be this as it may, there it something
so singular in the good fortune which has attended BONAPARTE from the period of
his quitting Alexandria, that, were it not known for truth, it might well be
taken for fiction. Sailing from the road of Aboukir on the 24th of August,
1799, he eludes the vigilance of the English cruisers, and lands at Frejus in
France on the 14th of October following, the forty-seventh day after his
departure from Egypt. On his arrival in Paris, so far from giving an account of
his conduct to the Directory, he turns his back on them; accepts the
proposition made to him, from another quarter, to effect a change in the
government; on the 9th of November, carries it into execution; and, profiting
by the <i>popularis aura</i>, fixes himself at the head of the State, at the
same time kicking down the ladder by which he climbed to power. To achieve all
this with such promptitude and energy, most assuredly required a mind of no
common texture; nor can any one deny that ambition would have done but little
towards its accomplishment, had it not been seconded by extraordinary
firmness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#introfr1">Return to text</a></p>

<p /><p /><p /><h1>A SKETCH OF PARIS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</h1>
<h2><a name="let01">LETTER I.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Calais, October 16, 1801.</i></p>
<p>MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>
<p>Had you not made it a particular request that I would give you the earliest
account of my debarkation in France, I should, probably, not have been tempted
to write to you till I reached Paris. I well know the great stress which you
lay on first impressions; but what little I have now to communicate will poorly
gratify your expectation.</p>
<p>From the date of this letter, you will perceive that, since we parted
yesterday, I have not been dilatory in my motions. No sooner had a messenger
from the Alien-Office brought me the promised passport, or rather his Majesty's
licence, permitting me to embark for France, than I proceeded on my
journey.</p>
<p>In nine hours I reached Dover, and, being authorized by a proper
introduction, immediately applied to Mr. Mantell, the agent for prisoners of
war, cartels, &amp;c. for a passage across the water. An English flag of truce
was then in the harbour, waiting only for government dispatches; and I found
that, if I could get my baggage visited in time, I might avail myself of the
opportunity of crossing the sea in this vessel. On having recourse to the
collector of the customs, I succeeded in my wish: the dispatches arriving
shortly after, mid my baggage being already shipped, I stepped off the quay
into the Nancy, on board of which I was the only passenger. A propitious breeze
sprang up at the moment, and, in less than three hours, wafted me to Calais
pier.</p>
<p>By the person who carried the dispatches to Citizen Mengaud, the commissary
for this department (<i>Pas de Calais</i>), I sent a card with my name and
rank, requesting permission to land and deliver to him a letter from M. Otto.
This step was indispensable: the vessel which brought me was, I find, the first
British flag of truce that has been suffered to enter the harbour, with the
exception of the Prince of Wales packet, now waiting here for the return of a
king's messenger from Paris; and her captain even has not yet been permitted to
go on shore. It therefore appears that I shall be the first Englishman, not in
an official character, who has set foot on French ground since the ratification
of the preliminary treaty.</p>
<p>The pier was presently crowded with people gazing at our vessel, as if she
presented a spectacle perfectly novel: but, except the tri-coloured cockade in
the hats of the military, I could not observe the smallest difference in their
general appearance. Instead of crops and round wigs, which I expected to see in
universal vogue, here were full as many powdered heads and long queues as
before the revolution. Frenchmen, in general, will, I am persuaded, ever be
Frenchmen in their dress, which, in my opinion, can never be
<i>revolutionized</i>, either by precept or example. The <i>citoyens</i>, as
far as I am yet able to judge, most certainly have not fattened by warfare more
than JOHN BULL: their visages are as sallow and as thin as formerly, though
their persons are not quite so meagre as they are pourtrayed by Hogarth.</p>
<p>The prospect of peace, however, seemed to have produced an exhilarating
effect on all ranks; satisfaction appeared on every countenance. According to
custom, a host of inkeepers' domestics boarded the vessel, each vaunting the
superiority of his master's accommodations. My old landlord Ducrocq presenting
himself to congratulate me on my arrival, soon freed me from their
importunities, and I, of course, decided in favour of the <i>Lion
d'Argent</i>.</p>
<p>Part of the <i>Boulogne</i> flotilla was lying in the harbour. Independently
of the decks of the gunboats being full of soldiers, with very few sailors
intermixed, playing at different games of chance, not a plank, not a log, or
piece of timber, was there on the quay but was also covered with similar
parties. This then accounts for that rage for gambling, which has carried to
such desperate lengths those among them whom the fate of war has lodged in our
prisons.</p>
<p>My attention was soon diverted from this scene, by a polite answer from the
commissary, inviting me to his house. I instantly disembarked to wait on him;
my letter containing nothing more than an introduction, accompanied by a
request that I might be furnished with a passport to enable me to proceed to
Paris without delay, Citizen Mengaud dispatched a proper person to attend me to
the town-hall, where the passports are made out, and signed by the mayor;
though they are not delivered till they have also received the commissary's
signature. However, to lose no time, while one of the clerks was drawing my
picture, or, in other words, taking down a minute description of my person, I
sent my keys to the custom-house, in order that my baggage might be
examined.</p>
<p>By what conveyance I was to proceed to Paris was the next point to be
settled; and this has brought me to the <i>Lion d'Argent</i>.</p>
<p>Among other vehicles, Ducrocq has, in his <i>remise</i>, an apparently-good
<i>cabriolet de voyage</i>, belonging to one of his Paris correspondents; but,
on account of the wretched state of the roads, he begs me to allow him time to
send for his coachmaker, to examine it scrupulously, that I may not be detained
by the way, from any accident happening to the carriage.</p>
<p>I was just on the point of concluding my letter, when a French naval
officer, who was on the pier when I landed, introduced himself to me, to know
whether I would do him the favour to accommodate him with a place in the
cabriolet under examination. I liked my new friend's appearance and manner too
well not to accede to his proposal.</p>
<p>The carriage is reported to be in good condition. I shall therefore send my
servant on before as a courier, instead of taking him with me as an inside
passenger. As we shall travel night and day, and the post-horses will be in
readiness at every stage, we may, I am told, expect to reach Paris in about
forty-two hours. Adieu; my next will be from the <i>great</i> city.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let02">LETTER II.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 19, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Here I am safe arrived; that is, without any broken bones; though my arms,
knees, and head are finely pummelled by the jolting of the carriage. Well might
Ducrocq say that the roads were bad! In several places, they are not passable
without danger&mdash;Indeed, the government is so fully aware of this, that an
inspector has been dispatched to direct immediate repairs to be made against
the arrival of the English ambassador; and, in some <i>communes</i>, the people
are at work by torch-light. With this exception, my journey was exceedingly
pleasant. At ten o'clock the first night, we reached <i>Montreuil</i>, where we
supped; the next day we breakfasted at <i>Abbeville</i>, dined at
<i>Amiens</i>, and supped that evening at <i>Clermont</i>.</p>
<p>The road between <i>Calais</i> and <i>Paris</i> is too well known to
interest by description. Most of the abbeys and monasteries, which present
themselves to the eye of the traveller, have either been converted into
hospitals or manufactories. Few there are, I believe, who will deny that this
change is for the better. A receptacle for the relief of suffering indigence
conveys a consolatory idea to the mind of the friend of human nature; while the
lover of industry cannot but approve of an establishment which, while it
enriches a State, affords employ to the needy and diligent. This,
unquestionably, is no bad appropriation of these buildings, which, when
inhabited by monks, were, for the most part, no more than an asylum of sloth,
hypocrisy, pride, and ignorance.</p>
<p>The weather was fine, which contributed not a little to display the country
to greater advantage; but the improvements recently made in agriculture are too
striking to escape the notice of the most inattentive observer. The open plains
and rising grounds of <i>ci-devant Picardy</i> which, from ten to fifteen years
ago, I have frequently seen, in this season, mostly lying fallow, and
presenting the aspect of one wide, neglected waste, are now all well
cultivated, and chiefly laid down in corn; and the corn, in general, seems to
have been sown with more than common attention.</p>
<p>My fellow-traveller, who was a <i>lieutenant de vaisseau</i>, belonging to
<i>Latouche Tréville's</i> flotilla, proved a very agreeable companion, and
extremely well-informed. This officer positively denied the circumstance of any
of their gun-boats being moored with chains during our last attack. While he
did ample justice to the bravery of our people, he censured the manner in which
it had been exerted. The divisions of boats arriving separately, he said, could
not afford to each other necessary support, and were thus exposed to certain
discomfiture. I made the best defence I possibly could; but truth bears down
all before it.</p>
<p>The loss on the side of the French, my fellow-traveller declared, was no
more than seven men killed and forty-five wounded. Such of the latter as were
in a condition to undergo the fatigue of the ceremony, were carried in
triumphal procession through the streets of <i>Boulogne</i>, where, after being
harangued by the mayor, they were rewarded with civic crowns from the hands of
their fair fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>Early the second morning after our departure from <i>Calais</i>, we reached
the town of <i>St. Denis</i>, which, at one time since the revolution, changed
its name for that of <i>Françiade</i>. I never pass through this place without
calling to mind the persecution which poor Abélard suffered from Adam, the
abbot, for having dared to say, that the body of <i>St. Denis</i>, first bishop
of Paris, in 240, which had been preserved in this abbey among the relics, was
not that of the areopagite, who died in 95. The ridiculous stories, imposed on
the credulity of the zealous catholics, respecting this wonderful saint, have
been exhibited in their proper light by Voltaire, as you may see by consulting
the <i>Questions sur l'Encyclopédie</i>, at the article <i>Denis</i>.</p>
<p>It is in every person's recollection that, in consequence of the National
Convention having decreed the abolition of royalty in France, it was proposed
to annihilate every vestige of it throughout the country. But, probably, you
are not aware of the thorough sweep that was made among the sepultures in this
abbey of <i>St. Denis</i>.</p>
<p>The bodies of the kings, queens, princes, princesses, and celebrated
personages, who had been interred here for nearly fifteen hundred years, were
taken up, and literally reduced to ashes. Not a wreck was left behind to make a
relic.</p>
<p>The remains of TURENNE alone were respected. All the other bodies, together
with the entrails or hearts, enclosed in separate urns, were thrown into large
pits, lined with a coat of quick lime: they were then covered with the same
substance; and the pits were afterwards filled up with earth. Most of them, as
may be supposed, were in a state of complete putrescency; of some, the bones
only remained, though a few were in good preservation.</p>
<p>The bodies of the consort of Charles I. Henrietta Maria of France, daughter
of Henry IV, who died in 1669, aged 60, and of their daughter Henrietta Stuart,
first wife of Monsieur, only brother to Lewis XIV, who died in 1670, aged 26,
both interred in the vault of the Bourbons, were consumed in the general
destruction.</p>
<p>The execution of this decree was begun at <i>St. Denis</i> on Saturday the
12th of October 1793, and completed on the 25th of the same month, in presence
of the municipality and several other persons.</p>
<p>On the 12th of November following, all the treasure of <i>St. Denis</i>,
(shrines, relics, &amp;c.) was removed: the whole was put into large wooden
chests, together with all the rich ornaments of the church, consisting of
chalices, pyxes, cups, copes, &amp;c. The same day these valuable articles were
sent off, in great state, in waggons, decorated for the purpose, to the
National Convention.</p>
<p>We left <i>St. Denis</i> after a hasty breakfast; and, on reaching Paris, I
determined to drive to the residence of a man whom I had never seen; but from
whom I had little doubt of a welcome reception. I accordingly alighted in the
<i>Rue neuve St. Roch</i>, where I found B----a, who perfectly answered the
character given me of him by M. S----i.</p>
<p>You already know that, through the interest of my friend, Captain O----y, I
was so fortunate as to procure the exchange of B----a's only son, a deserving
youth, who had been taken prisoner at sea, and languished two years in
confinement in Portchester-Castle.</p>
<p>Before I could introduce myself, one of young B----a's sisters proclaimed my
name, as if by inspiration; and I was instantly greeted with the cordial
embraces of the whole family. This scene made me at once forget the fatigues of
my journey; and, though I had not been in bed for three successive nights, the
agreeable sensations excited in my mind, by the unaffected expression of
gratitude, banished every inclination to sleep. If honest B----a and his family
felt themselves obliged to me, I felt myself doubly and trebly obliged to
Captain O----y; for, to his kind exertion, was I indebted for the secret
enjoyment arising from the performance of a disinterested action.</p>
<p>S----i was no sooner informed of my arrival, than he hastened to obey the
invitation to meet me at dinner, and, by his presence, enlivened the family
party. After spending a most agreeable day, I retired to a temporary lodging,
which B----a had procured me in the neighbourhood. I shall remain in it no
longer than till I can suit myself with apartments in a private house, where I
can be more retired, or at least subject to less noise, than in a public
hotel.</p>
<p>Of the fifty-eight hours which I employed in performing my journey hither
from London, forty-four were spent on my way between Calais and Paris; a
distance that I have often travelled with ease in thirty-six, when the roads
were in tolerable repair. Considerable delay too is at present occasioned by
the erection of <i>barrières</i>, or turnpike-bars, which did not exist before
the revolution. At this day, they are established throughout all the
departments, and are an insuperable impediment to expedition; for, at night,
the toll-gatherers are fast asleep, and the bars being secured, you are obliged
to wait patiently till these good citizens choose to rise from their
pillow.</p>
<p>To counterbalance this inconvenience, you are not now plagued, as formerly,
by custom-house officers on the frontiers of <i>every</i> department. My
baggage being once searched at <i>Calais</i>, experienced no other visit; but,
at the upper town of <i>Boulogne</i>, a sight of my travelling passport was
required; by mistake in the dark, I gave the <i>commis</i> a scrawl, put into
my hands by Ducrocq, containing an account of the best inns on the road. Would
you believe that this inadvertency detained us a considerable time, so
extremely inquisitive are they, at the present moment, respecting all papers?
At <i>Calais</i>, the custom-house officers even examined every piece of paper
used in the packing of my baggage. This scrutiny is not particularly adopted
towards Englishmen; but must, I understand, be undergone by travellers of every
country, on entering the territory of the Republic.</p>
<p><i>P. S.</i> Lord Cornwallis is expected with impatience; and, at <i>St.
Denis</i>, an escort of dragoons of the 19th demi-brigade is in waiting to
attend him into Paris.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let03">LETTER III.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 21, 1801.</i></p>
<p>On approaching this capital, my curiosity was excited in the highest degree;
and, as the carriage passed rapidly along from the <i>Barrière</i>, through the
<i>Porte St. Denis</i>, to the <i>Rue neuve St. Roch</i>, my eyes wandered in
all directions, anxiously seeking every shade of distinction between
<i>monarchical</i> and <i>republican</i> Paris.</p>
<p>The first thing that attracted my attention, on entering the
<i>faubourg</i>, was the vast number of inscriptions placed, during the
revolution, on many of the principal houses; but more especially on public
buildings of every description. They are painted in large, conspicuous letters;
and the following is the most general style in which they have been originally
worded:</p>
<p class="center">"RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE, UNE ET INDIVISIBLE."<br />
"LIBERTÉ, ÉGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ, OU LA MORT."</p>
<p>Since the exit of the French Nero, the last three words "<i>ou la mort</i>"
have been obliterated, but in few places are so completely effaced as not to be
still legible. In front of all the public offices and national establishments,
the tri-coloured flag is triumphantly displayed; and almost every person you
meet wears in his hat the national cockade.</p>
<p>The tumult which, ten or twelve years ago, rendered the streets of Paris so
noisy, so dirty, and at the same time so dangerous, is now most sensibly
diminished. Boileau's picture of them is no longer just. No longer are seen
those scenes of confusion occasioned by the frequent stoppages of coaches and
carts, and the contentions of the vociferating drivers. You may now pass the
longest and most crowded thoroughfares, either on foot or otherwise, without
obstacle or inconvenience. The contrast is striking.</p>
<p>Indeed, from what I have observed, I should presume that there is not, at
the present day, one tenth part of the number of carriages which were in use
here in 1780-90. Except on the domestics of foreign ambassadors and foreigners,
I have as yet noticed nothing like a livery; and, in lieu of armorial bearings,
every carriage, without distinction, has a number painted on the pannel.
However, if private equipages are scarce, thence ensues more than one
advantage; the public are indemnified by an increased number of good hackney
coaches, chariots, and cabriolets; and, besides, as I have just hinted,
pedestrians are not only far less exposed to being bespattered, but also to
having their limbs fractured.</p>
<p>Formerly, a <i>seigneur de la cour</i> conceived himself justified in
suffering his coachman to drive at a mischievous rate; and in narrow, crowded
streets, where there is no foot-pavement, it was extremely difficult for
persons walking to escape the wheels of a great number of carriages rattling
along in this shameful manner. But he who guided the chariot of a <i>ministre
d'état</i>, considered it as a necessary and distinctive mark of his master's
pre-eminence to <i>brûler le pavé</i>. This is so strictly true, that, before
the revolution, I have here witnessed repeated accidents of the most serious
nature, resulting from the exercise of this sort of ministerial privilege: on
one occasion particularly, I myself narrowly escaped unhurt, when a decent,
elderly woman was thrown down, close by my feet, and had both her thighs broken
through the unfeeling wantonness of the coachman of the Baron de Breteuil, at
that time minister for the department of Paris.</p>
<p>Owing to the salutary regulations of the police, the recurrence of these
accidents is now, in a great measure, prevented; and, as the empirics say in
their hand-bills: "<i>Prevention is better than cure.</i>"</p>
<p>But for these differences, a person who had not seen Paris for some years,
might, unless he were to direct his visits to particular quarters, cross it
from one extremity to the other, without remarking any change to inform his
mind, that here had been a revolution, or rather that, for the last ten years,
this city had been almost one continual scene of revolutions.</p>
<p>Bossnet, once preaching before Lewis XIV, exclaimed: "Kings die, and so do
kingdoms!" Could that great preacher rise from his grave into the pulpit, and
behold France without a king, and that kingdom, not crumbled away, but
enlarged, almost with the rapid accumulation of a snow-ball, into an enormous
mass of territory, under the title of French Republic, what would he not have
to say in a sermon? <i>Rien de nouveau sous le ciel</i>, though an old proverb,
would not now suit as a maxim. This, in fact, seems the age of wonders. The
league of monarchs has ended by producing republics; while a republic has
raised a dukedom into a monarchy, and, by its vast preponderance, completely
overturned the balance of power.</p>
<p>Not knowing when I may have an opportunity of sending this letter, I shall
defer to close it for the present, as I may possibly lengthen it. But you must
not expect much order in my narrations. I throw my thoughts on paper just as
they happen to present themselves, without any studied arrangement.</p>
<p /><p /><p /><p class="right"><i>October 21, in continuation</i>.</p>
<p>When we have been for some time in the habit of corresponding with
strangers, we are apt to draw such inferences from their language and style, as
furnish us with the means of sketching an ideal portrait of their person. This
was the case with myself.</p>
<p>Through the concurrence of the two governments, I had, as you know,
participated, in common with others, in the indulgence of being permitted to
correspond, occasionally, on subjects of literature with several of the
<i>savans</i> and literati of France. Indeed, the principal motive of my
journey to Paris was to improve that sort of acquaintance, by personal
intercourse, so as to render it more interesting to both parties. In my
imagination, I had drawn a full-length picture of most of my literary
correspondents. I was now anxious to see the originals, and compare the
resemblance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, having first paid my respects to Mr. M----y, the successor to
Captain C----s, as commissary for the maintenance and exchange of British
prisoners of war, and at present <i>Chargé d'affaires</i> from our court to the
French Republic, I called on M. F----u, formerly minister of the naval
department, and at present counsellor of state, and member of the National
Institute, as well as of the board of longitude. I then visited M. O----r, and
afterwards M. L------re, also members of the Institute, and both well known to
our proficients in natural history, by the works which each has published in
the different branches of that interesting science.</p>
<p>In one only of my ideal portraits had I been very wide of the likeness.
However, without pretending to be a Lavater, I may affirm that I should not
have risked falling into a mistake like that committed, on a somewhat similar
occasion, by Voltaire.</p>
<p>This colossus of French literature, having been for a long time in
correspondence with the great Frederic, became particularly anxious to see that
monarch. On his arrival in a village where the head-quarters of the Prussian
army were then established, Voltaire inquired for the king's lodging: thither
he paced with redoubled speed; and, being directed to the upper part of the
house, he hastily crossed a large garret; he then found himself in a second,
and was just on the point of entering the third, when, on turning round, he
perceived in one of the comers of the room, a soldier, not overclean in
appearance, lying on a sorry bedstead. He went up and said to him with
eagerness: "Where's the king?"&mdash;"I am Frederic," replied the soldier; and,
sure enough, it was the monarch himself.</p>
<p>I am now settled in my new apartments, which are situated in the most
centrical part of Paris. When you visit this capital, I would by all means,
recommend to you, should you intend to remain here a few weeks, to get into
private lodgings.</p>
<p>I know of no article here so much augmented in price, within the last ten
years, as the apartments in all the hotels. After looking at several of them in
the <i>Rue de la Loi</i>, accompanied by a French friend, who was so obliging
as to take on himself all the trouble of inquiry, while I remained a silent
bystander, I had the curiosity to go to the <i>Hôtel d'Angleterre</i>, in the
<i>Rue des Filles St. Thomas</i>, hot far from the <i>ci-devant Palais
Royal</i>. The same apartments on the first floor of this hotel which I
occupied in 1789, happened to be vacant. At that time I paid for them twelve
louis d'or a month; the furniture was then new; it is now much the worse for
nearly eleven years' wear; and the present landlord asked twenty-five louis a
month, and even refused twenty-two, if taken for three months certain. The fact
is, that all the landlords of ready-furnished hotels in Paris seem to be buoyed
up with an idea that, on the peace, the English and foreigners of other nations
will flock hither in such numbers as to enable them to reap a certain and
plentiful harvest. Not but all lodgings are considerably increased in price,
which is ascribed to the increase of taxes.</p>
<p>To find private lodgings, you have only to cast your eye on the daily
advertiser of Paris, called <i>Les Petites Affiches</i>. There I read a
description of my present quarters, which are newly fitted up in every
particular, and, I assure you, with no small degree of tasteful fancy. My
landlady, who is a milliner, and, for aught I know, a very fashionable one,
left not the smallest convenience to my conjecture, but explained the
particular use of every hole and corner in the most significant manner, not
even excepting the <i>boudoir</i>.</p>
<p>This would be a most excellent situation for any one whose principal object
was to practise speaking French; for, on the right hand of the
<i>porte-cochère</i> or gateway, (which, by the bye, is here reckoned an
indispensable appendage to a proper lodging), is the <i>magazin des modes</i>,
where my landlady presides over twenty damsels, many of whom, though
assiduously occupied in making caps and bonnets, would, I am persuaded, find
repartee for the most witty gallant.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let04">LETTER IV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 23, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Since my arrival, I have been so much engaged in paying and receiving
visits, that I really have not yet been able to take even a hasty view of any
of the grand sights introduced here since the revolution,</p>
<p>On Wednesday I dined with M. S----i, whose new 8vo edition of Buffon
proceeds, I find, with becoming spirit. It is quite a journey to his residence;
for he lives in one of the most retired quarters of Paris, However, I had no
reason to repine at the distance, as the party was exceedingly cheerful.
Naturalists and literati were not wanting.</p>
<p>Egypt was a subject that engrossed much of the conversation: it was
mentioned as a matter of regret that, during the dominion of the French in that
country, curiosity had not prompted the Institute, established at Cairo, to
open one of the pyramids, with a view of ascertaining the object of the
erection of those vast masses. At the desert, we had luscious grapes as large
as damsons, in bunches of from three to five pounds in weight. They were of the
species of the famous <i>chasselas de Fontainebleau</i>, which are said to have
sprung from a stock of vine-plants, imported by Francis I. from the island of
Cyprus. These did not come from that town, but grew against the naked wall in
S----i's garden. From this you may form a judgment of the climate of Paris.</p>
<p>The persons with whom I have had any correspondence, respecting literature,
vie with each other in shewing me every mark of cordial hospitality; and those
to whom I have been introduced, are by no means backward in friendly attention.
All the lovers of science here seem to rejoice that the communication, which
has been so long interrupted between the two countries, promises to be shortly
re-opened.</p>
<p>After dining yesterday with Mr. M----y, the British minister, in company
with Mr. D----n, the member for Ilchester, we all three went to an exhibition
almost facing Mr. M----y's residence  in the <i>Rue St. Dominique</i>. This was
the third time of its being open to the public. As it is of a novel kind, some
account of it may not be uninteresting. In French, it is denominated</p>
<p class="center">THERMOLAMPES,<br />
<i>or stoves which afford heat and light on an economical plan</i>.</p>
<p>The author of this invention, for which a patent has been obtained, is M.
LEBON, an engineer of bridges and highways. The place of exhibition was the
ground floor of one of the large hotels in the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, on
which was a suite of rooms, extremely favourable for displaying the effect of
this new method of lighting and warming apartments.</p>
<p>In lieu of fire or candle, on the chimney stood a large crystal globe, in
which appeared a bright and clear flame diffusing a very agreeable heat; and on
different pieces of furniture were placed candlesticks with metal candles, from
the top of each of which issued a steady light, like that of a lamp burning
with spirits of wine. These different receptacles were supplied with
inflammable gas by means of tubes communicating with an apparatus underneath.
By this contrivance, in short, all the apartments were warmed very comfortably,
and illuminated in a brilliant manner.</p>
<p>On consulting M. LEBON, he communicated to me the following observations:
"You may have remarked," said he, "in sitting before a fire, that wood
sometimes burns without flame, but with much smoke, and then you experience
little heat, sometimes with flame, but with little smoke, and then you find
much warmth. You may have remarked too, that ill-made charcoal emits smoke; it
is, on that account, susceptible of flaming again; and the characteristic
difference between wood and charcoal is, that the latter has lost, together
with its smoke, the principle and aliment of flame, without which you obtain
but little heat. Experience next informs us, that this portion of smoke, the
aliment of flame, is not an oily vapour condensable by cooling, but a gas, a
permanent air, which may be washed, purified, conducted, distributed, and
afterwards turned into flame at any distance from the hearth.</p>
<p>"It is almost needless," continued he, "to point out the formation of
verdigrise, white lead, and a quantity of other operations, in which acetous
acid is employed. I shall only remark that it is this pyroligneous acid which
penetrates smoked meat and fish, that it has an effect on leather which it
hardens, and that <i>thermolampes</i> are likely to render tanning-mills
unnecessary, by furnishing the tan without further trouble. But to return to
the aëriform principle.</p>
<p>"This aliment of flame is deprived of those humid vapours, so perceptible
and so disagreeable to the organs of sight and smell. Purified to a perfect
transparency, it floats in the state of cold air, and suffers itself to be
directed by the smallest and most fragil pipes. Chimnies of an inch square,
made in the thickness of the plaster of ceilings or walls, tubes even of gummed
silk would answer this purpose. The end alone of the tube, which, by bringing
the inflammable gas into contact with the atmospheric air, allows it to catch
fire, and on which the flame reposes, ought to be of metal.</p>
<p>"By a distribution so easy to be established, a single stove may supply the
place of all the chimnies of a house. Every where inflammable air is ready to
diffuse immediately heat and light of the most glowing or most mild nature,
simultaneously or separately, according to your wishes. In the twinkling of an
eye, you may conduct the flame from one room to another; an advantage equally
convenient and economical, and which can never be obtained with our common
stoves and chimnies. No sparks, no charcoal, no soot, to trouble you; no ashes,
no wood, to soil your apartments. By night, as well as by day, you can have a
fire in your room, without a servant being obliged to look after it. Nothing in
the <i>thermolampes</i>, not even the smallest portion of inflammable air, can
escape combustion; while in our chimnies, torrents evaporate, and even carry
off with them the greater part of the heat produced.</p>
<p>"The advantage of being able to purify and proportion, in some measure, the
principles of the gas which feeds the flame is," said M. LEBON, "set forth in
the clearest manner. But this flame is so subjected to our caprice, that even
to tranquilize the imagination, it suffers itself to be confined in a crystal
globe, which is never tarnished, and thus presents a filter pervious to light
and heat. A part of the tube that conducts the inflammable air, carries off,
out of doors, the produce of this combustion, which, nevertheless, according to
the experiments of modern chymists, can scarcely be any thing more than an
aqueous vapour.</p>
<p>"Who cannot but be fond of having recourse to a flame so subservient? It
will dress your victuals, which, as well as your cooks, will not be exposed to
the vapour of charcoal; it will warm again those dishes on your table; dry your
linen; heat your oven, and the water for your baths or your washing, with every
economical advantage that can be wished. No moist or black vapours; no ashes,
no breaze, to make a dirt, or oppose the communication of heat; no useless loss
of caloric; you may, by shutting an opening, which is no longer necessary for
placing the wood in your oven, compress and coerce the torrents of heat that
were escaping from it.</p>
<p>"It may easily be conceived, that an inflammable principle so docile and so
active may be made to yield the most magnificent illuminations. Streams of fire
finely drawn out, the duration, colour, and form of which may be varied at
pleasure, the motion of suns and turning-columns, must produce an effect no
less agreeable than brilliant." Indeed, this effect was exhibited on the garden
façade of M. LEBON'S residence.</p>
<p>"Wood," concluded he, "yields in condensable vapours two thirds of its
weight; those vapours may therefore be employed to produce the effects of our
steam-engines, and it is needless to borrow this succour from foreign
water."</p>
<p><i>P. S.</i>. On the 1st of last Vendémiaire, (23rd of September), the
government presented to the Chief Consul a sword, whose hilt was adorned with
fourteen diamonds, the largest of which, called the <i>Regent</i>, from its
having been purchased by the Duke of Orleans, when Regent, weighs 184 carats.
This is the celebrated <i>Pitt</i> diamond, of which we have heard so much: but
its weight is exceeded by that of the diamond purchased by the late empress of
Russia, which weighs 194 carats; not to speak of the more famous diamond, in
possession of the Great Mogul, which is said to weigh 280 carats.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let05">LETTER V.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 24, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Last night I received yours of the 20th ult. and as Mr. M----y purposes to
send off a dispatch this morning, and will do me the favour to forward this,
with my former letters, I hasten to write you a few lines.</p>
<p>I scarcely need assure you, my dear friend, that I will, with pleasure,
communicate to you my remarks on this great city and its inhabitants, and
describe to you, as far as I am able, the principal curiosities which it
contains, particularizing, as you desire, those recently placed here by the
chance of war; and giving you a succinct, historical account of the most
remarkable national establishments and public buildings. But to pass in review
the present state of the <i>arts, sciences, literature, manners, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</i> in this capital, and contrast it with that which existed before the
revolution, is a task indeed; and far more, I fear, than it will be in my power
to accomplish.</p>
<p>However, if you will be content to gather my observations as they occur; to
listen to my reflections, while the impression of the different scenes which
produced them, is still warm in my mind; in short, to take a faithful sketch,
in lieu of a finished picture, I will do the best I can for your
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Relying on your indulgence, you shall know the life I lead: I will, as it
were, take you by the arm, and, wherever I go, you shall be my companion.
Perhaps, by pursuing this plan, you will not, at the expiration of three or
four months, think your time unprofitably spent. Aided by the experience
acquired by having occasionally resided here, for several months together,
before the revolution, it will be my endeavour to make you as well acquainted
with Paris, as I shall then hope to be myself. For this purpose, I will lay
under contribution every authority, both written and oral, worthy of being
consulted.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let06">LETTER VI</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 26, 1801.</i></p>
<p>From particular passages in your letter, I clearly perceive your anxiety to
be introduced among those valuable antiques which now adorn the banks of the
Seine. On that account, I determined to postpone all other matters, and pay my
first visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, established in the</p>
<p class="center">LOUVRE.</p>
<p>But, before, we enter the interior of this building, it may not be amiss to
give you some account of its construction, and describe to you its exterior
beauties.</p>
<p>The origin of this palace, as well as the etymology of its name, is lost in
the darkness of time. It is certain, however, that it existed, under the
appellation of <i>Louvre</i>, in the reign of Philip Augustus, who surrounded
it with ditches and towers, and made it a fortress. The great tower of the
<i>Louvre</i>, celebrated in history, was insulated, and built in the middle of
the court. All the great feudatories of the crown derived their tenure from
this tower, and came hither to swear allegiance and pay homage.
<a name="let06fr1"></a>"It was," says St. Foix, "a prison previously prepared
for them, if they violated their oaths."[<a href="#let06f1">1</a>] Three Counts
of Flanders were confined in it at different periods.</p>
<p>The <i>Louvre</i>, far from being cheerful from its construction, received
also from this enormous tower a melancholy and terrifying aspect which rendered
it unworthy of being a royal residence. Charles V. endeavoured to enliven and
embellish this gloomy abode, and made it tolerably commodious for those times.
Several foreign monarchs successively lodged in it; such as Manuel, emperor of
Constantinople; Sigismund, emperor of Germany; and the emperor Charles the
Fifth.</p>
<p>This large tower of the <i>Louvre</i>, which had, at different periods,
served as a palace to the kings of France, as a prison to the great lords, and
as a treasury to the state, was at length taken down in 1528.</p>
<p>The <i>Tower of the Library</i> was famous, among several others, because it
contained that of Charles V. the most considerable one of the time, and in
which the number of volumes amounted to nine hundred.</p>
<p class="center">OLD LOUVRE</p>
<p>The part of this palace which, at the present day, is called the <i>Old
Louvre</i>, was begun under Francis I. from the plan of PIERRE LESCOT, abbot of
Clugny; and the sculpture was executed by JEAN GOUGEON, whose minute
correctness is particularly remarkable in the festoons of the frieze of the
second order, and in the devices emblematic of the amours of Henry II. This
edifice, though finished, was not inhabited during the reign of that king, but
it was by his son Charles IX.</p>
<p>Under him, the <i>Louvre</i> became the bloody theatre of treacheries and
massacres which time will never efface from the memory of mankind, and which,
till the merciless reign of Robespierre, were unexampled in the history of this
country. I mean the horrors of St. Bartholemew's day.</p>
<p>While the alarmed citizens were swimming across the river to escape from
death, Charles IX. from a window of this palace, was firing at them with his
arquebuse. During that period of the revolution, when all means were employed
to excite and strengthen the enmity of the people against their kings, this act
of atrocity was called to their mind by an inscription placed under the very
window, which looks on the <i>Quai du Louvre</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, this instance of Charles's barbarity is fully corroborated by
historians. "When it was day-light," says Brantome, "the king peeped out of his
chamber-window, and seeing some people in the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>
moving about and running away, he took a large arquebuse which he had ready at
hand, and, calling out incessantly: <i>Kill, kill!</i> fired a great many shots
at them, but in vain; for the piece did not carry so far."&mdash;This prince,
according to Masson, piqued himself on his dexterity in cutting off at a single
blow the head of the asses and pigs which he met with on his way. Lansac, one
of his favourites, having found him one day with his sword drawn and ready to
strike his mule, asked him seriously: "What quarrel has then happened between
His Most Christian Majesty and my mule?" Murad Bey far surpassed this
blood-thirsty monarch in address and strength. The former, we are told by
travellers in Egypt, has been known, when riding past an ox, to cut off its
head with one stroke of his scimitar.</p>
<p>The capital was dyed with the blood of Charles's murdered subjects. Into
this very <i>Louvre</i>, into the chamber of Marguerite de Valois, the king's
sister, and even to her bed, in which she was then lying, did the fanatics
pursue the officers belonging to the court itself, as is circumstantially
related by that princess in her Memoirs.</p>
<p>Let us draw the curtain on these scenes of horror, and pass rapidly from
this period of fanaticism and cruelty, when the <i>Louvre</i> was stained by so
many crimes to times more happy, when this palace became the quiet cradle of
the arts and sciences, the school for talents, the <i>arena</i> for genius, and
the asylum of artists and literati.</p>
<p>The centre pavilion over the principal gate of the <i>Old Louvre</i>, was
erected under the reign of Lewis XIII. from the designs of LE MERCIER, as well
as the angle of the left part of the building, parallel to that built by Henry
II. The eight gigantic cariatides which are there seen, were sculptured by
SARRASIN.</p>
<p>The façade towards the <i>Jardin de l'Infante</i>, (as it is called), that
towards the <i>Place du Louvre</i>, and that over the little gate, towards the
river, which were constructed under the reigns of Charles IX. and Henry III. in
the midst of the civil wars of the League, partake of the taste of the time, in
regard to the multiplicity of the ornaments; but the interior announces, by the
majesty of its decorations, the refined taste of Lewis XIV.</p>
<p class="center">NEW LOUVRE.</p>
<p><a name="let06fr2"></a>The part of the <i>Louvre</i>, which, with the two
sides of the old building, forms the perfect square, three hundred and
seventy-eight feet[<a href="#let06f2">2</a>] in extent, called the <i>New
Louvre</i>, consists in two double façades, which are still unfinished. LE
VEAU, and after him D'ORBAY, were the architects under whose direction this
augmentation was made by order of Lewis XIV.</p>
<p>That king at first resolved to continue the <i>Louvre</i> on the plan begun
by Francis I.: for some time he caused it to be pursued, but having conceived a
more grand and magnificent design, he ordered the foundation of the superb
edifice now standing, to be laid on the 17th of October 1665, under the
administration of COLBERT.</p>
<p>Through a natural prejudice, Lewis XIV. thought that he could find no where
but in Italy an artist sufficiently skilful to execute his projects of
magnificence. He sent for the Cavaliere BERNINI from Rome. This artist, whose
reputation was established, was received in France with all the pomp due to
princes of the blood. The king ordered that, in the towns through which he
might pass, he should be complimented and receive presents from the
corporations, &amp;c.</p>
<p>BERNINI was loaded with wealth and honours: notwithstanding the
prepossession of the court in favour of this Italian architect, notwithstanding
his talents, he did not succeed in his enterprise. After having forwarded the
foundation of this edifice, he made a pretext of the impossibility of spending
the winter in a climate colder than that of Italy. "He was promised," says St.
Foix, "three thousand louis a year if he would stay; but," he said, "he would
positively go and die in his <i>own</i> country." On the eve of his departure,
the king sent him three thousand louis, with the grant of a pension of five
hundred. He received the whole with great coolness.</p>
<p>Several celebrated architects now entered the lists to complete this grand
undertaking.&mdash;MANSARD presented his plans, with which COLBERT was
extremely pleased: the king also approved of them, and absolutely insisted on
their being executed without any alteration. MANSARD replied that he would
rather renounce the glory of building this edifice than the liberty of
correcting himself, and changing his design when he thought he could improve
it. Among the competitors was CLAUDE PERRAULT, that physician so defamed by
Boileau, the poet. His plans were preferred, and merited the preference. Many
pleasantries were circulated at the expense of the new medical architect; and
PERRAULT replied to those sarcasms by producing the beautiful colonnade of the
<i>Louvre</i>, the master-piece of French architecture, and the admiration of
all Europe.</p>
<p>The façade of this colonnade, which is of the Corinthian order; is five
hundred and twenty-five feet in length: it is divided into two peristyles and
three avant-corps. The principal gate is in the centre avant-corps, which is
decorated with eight double columns, crowned by a pediment, whose raking
cornices are composed of two stones only, each fifty-four feet in length by
eight in breadth, though no more than eighteen inches in thickness. They were
taken from the quarries of Meudon, and formed but one single block, which was
sawed into two. The other two avant-corps are ornamented by six pilasters, and
two columns of the same order, and disposed in the same manner. On the top, in
lieu of a ridged roof, is a terrace, bordered by a stone balustrade, the
pedestals of which are intended to bear trophies intermixed with vases.</p>
<p>PERRAULT'S enemies disputed with him the invention of this master-piece.
They maintained that it belonged to LE VEAU, the architect; but, since the
discovery of the original manuscript and drawings of PERRAULT, there no longer
remains a doubt respecting the real author of this beautiful production.</p>
<p>In front of this magnificent colonnade, a multitude of salesmen erect their
stalls, and there display quantities of old clothes, rags, &amp;c. This
contrast, as Mercier justly remarks, still speaks to the eye of the attentive
observer. It is the image of all the rest, grandeur and beggary, side by
side.</p>
<p>However, it is not on the <i>outside</i> of these walls only, that beggary
has been so nearly allied to grandeur. At least we have a solitary instance of
this truth of a very sinking nature.</p>
<p>Cardinal de Retz tells us, that going one morning to the <i>Louvre</i> to
see the Queen of England, he found her in the chamber of her daughter,
aftenwards Dutchess of Orleans, and that she said to him: "You see, I come to
keep Henriette company: the poor girl could not leave her bed to-day, for want
of fuel."&mdash;It is true, he adds, that, for six months past Cardinal Mazarin
had not paid her pension; the tradesmen, would no longer give her credit, and
she had not a piece of wood to warm her.</p>
<p>Like St. Paul's in London, the façade of the <i>Louvre</i> cannot be seen to
the best advantage, on account of the proximity of the surrounding buildings;
and, like many other great undertakings too, will, probably, never be
completed, but remain a monument of the fickleness of the nation.</p>
<p>Lewis XIV, after having for a long time made the <i>Louvre</i> his
residence; abandoned it for <i>Versailles</i>: "Sire," said Dufreny once to
that prince, "I never look at the <i>New Louvre</i>, without exclaiming, superb
monument of the magnificence of our greatest kings, you would have been
finished, had you been given to one of the begging orders of friars!" From that
period, the <i>Louvre</i> was wholly consecrated to the sittings of different
academies, and to the accommodation of several men of science and artists, to
whom free apartments were allotted.</p>
<p>I much regret having, for this year at least, lost a sight here, which I
should have viewed with no inconsiderable degree of attention. This is the</p>
<p class="center">PUBLIC EXHIBITION OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF FRENCH INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>Under the directorial government, this exhibition was opened in the <i>Champ
de Mars</i>; but it now takes place, annually, in the square of the
<i>Louvre</i>, during the five complementary days of the republican calendar;
namely, from the 18th to the 22d of September, both inclusive.</p>
<p>The exhibition not only includes manufactures of every sort, but also every
new discovery, invention, and improvement. For the purpose of displaying these
objects to advantage, temporary buildings are erected along the four interior
walls of this square, each of which are subdivided into twenty-five porticoes;
so that the whole square of the <i>Louvre</i>, during that period, represents a
fair with a hundred booths. The resemblance, I am told, is rendered still more
perfect by the prodigious crowd; persons of all ranks being indiscriminately
admitted to view these productions. Precautions, however, are taken to prevent
the indiscreet part of the public from rushing into the porticoes, and
sentinels are posted at certain intervals to preserve order.</p>
<p>This, undoubtedly, is a very laudable institution, and extremely well
calculated to excite emulation in the national manufactures, specimens of which
being sent from all the principal manufacturing towns, the hundred porticoes
may be said to comprise an epitome of the present state of all the flourishing
manufactures of France. Indeed, none but new inventions and articles of
finished workmanship, the fabrication of which is known, are suffered to make
part of the exhibition. Even these are not admitted till after a previous
examination, and on the certificate of a private jury of five members,
appointed for that purpose by the prefect of each department. A new jury,
composed of fifteen members, nominated by the Minister of the Interior, again
examine the different articles admitted; and agreeably to their decision, the
government award premiums and medals to those persons who have made the
greatest improvement in any particular fabric or branch of industry, or
produced any new discovery or invention. The successful candidates are
presented to the Chief Consul by the Minister of the Interior, and have the
honour of dining with him at his public monthly dinner.</p>
<p>From all that I can learn concerning this interesting exhibition, it
appears, that, though the useful arts, in general, cannot at present be put in
competition here with those of a similar description among us, the object of
the French government is to keep up a spirit of rivalship, and encourage, by
every possible means, the improvement of those manufactures in which England is
acknowledged to surpass other countries.</p>
<p>I am reminded that it is time to prepare for going out to dinner. I must
therefore not leave this letter, like the <i>Louvre</i>, unfinished.
Fortunately, my good friend, the prevailing fashion here is to dine very late,
which leaves me a long morning; but for this, I know not when I should have an
opportunity of writing long letters. Restrain then your impatience, and I
promise that you shall very shortly be ushered into the GALLERY OF
ANTIQUES,</p>

<h2><a name="let07">LETTER VII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 28, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Having, in my last letter, described to you the outside of the
<i>Louvre</i>, (with the exception of the Great Gallery, of which I shall speak
more at length in another place), I shall now proceed to give you an account of
some of the principal national establishments contained within its walls.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the <i>Louvre</i> was, as I have said, the seat of
different academies, such as the <i>French Academy</i>, the <i>Academy of
Sciences</i>, the <i>Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres</i>, the
<i>Academy of Painting and Sculpture</i>, and the <i>Academy of
Architecture</i>. All these are replaced by the <i>National Institute of Arts
and Sciences</i>, of which, however, I shall postpone further mention till I
conduct you to one of its public sittings.</p>
<p>At the period to which I revert, there existed in the <i>Louvre</i> a hall,
called the <i>Salle des Antiques</i>, where, besides, some original statues by
French artists, were assembled models in plaster of the most celebrated
master-pieces of sculpture in Italy, together with a small number of antiques.
In another apartment, forming part of those assigned to the Academy of
Painting, and called the <i>Galérie d'Apollon</i>, were seen several pictures,
chiefly of the French school; and it was intended that the Great Gallery should
be formed into a Museum, containing a collection of the finest pictures and
statues at the disposal of the crown.</p>
<p>This plan, which had partly been carried into execution under the old
<i>régime</i>, is now completed, but in a manner infinitely more magnificent
than could possibly have been effected without the advantages of conquest. The
<i>Great Gallery</i> and <i>Saloon</i> of the <i>Louvre</i> are solely
appropriated to the exhibition of pictures of the old masters of the Italian,
Flemish, and French schools; and the <i>Gallery of Apollo</i> to that of their
drawings; while a suite of lofty apartments has been purposely fitted up in
this palace for the reception of original antiques, in lieu of those copies of
them before-mentioned. In other rooms, adjoining to the Great Gallery, are
exhibited, as formerly, that is during one month every year, the productions of
living painters, sculptors, architects, and draughtsmen.</p>
<p>These different exhibitions are placed under the superintendance of a board
of management, or an administration, (as the French term it), composed of a
number of antiquaries, artists, and men of science, inferior to none in Europe
in skill, judgment, taste, or erudition. The whole of this grand establishment
bears the general title of</p>
<p class="center">CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS.</p>
<p>The treasures of painting and sculpture which the French nation have
acquired by the success of their arms, or by express conditions in treaties of
alliance or neutrality, are so immense as to enable them, not only to render
this CENTRAL MUSEUM the grandest collection of master-pieces in the world, but
also to establish fifteen departmental Museums in fifteen of the principal
towns of France. This measure, evidently intended to favour the progress of the
fine arts, will case Paris of a great number of the pictures, statues, &amp;c.
amassed here from different parts of France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy,
Piedmont, Savoy, and the States of. Venice.</p>
<p>If you cast your eye on the annexed <i>Plan of Paris</i>, and suppose
yourself near the exterior south-west angle of the <i>Louvre</i>, or, as it is
more emphatically styled, the NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES, you will be
in the right-hand corner of the <i>Place du Vieux Louvre</i>, in which quarter
is the present entrance to the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS. Here, after passing
through a court, you enter a vestibule, on the left of which is the Hall of the
Administration of the Museum. On the ground-floor, facing the door of this
vestibule, is the entrance to the</p>
<p class="center">GALLERY OF ANTIQUES.</p>
<p>In this gallery, which was, for the first time, opened to the public on the
18th of Brumaire, year ix. of the French republic, (9th of November 1800), are
now distributed no less than one hundred and forty-six statues, busts, and
bas-reliefs. It consists of several handsome apartments, bearing appropriate
denominations, according to the principal subjects which each contains. Six
only are at present completely arranged for public inspection: but many others
are in a state of preparation.</p>
<p>The greater part of the statues here exhibited, are the fruit of the
conquests of the army of Italy. Conformably to the treaty of Tolentino, they
were selected at Rome, from the Capitol and the Vatican, by BARTHÉLEMY,
BERTHOLET, MOITTE, MONGE, THOUIN, and TINET, who were appointed, by the French
government, commissioners for the research of objects appertaining to the Arts
and Sciences.</p>
<p>In the vestibule, for the moderate price of fifteen <i>sous</i>, is sold a
catalogue, which is not merely a barren index, but a perspicuous and
satisfactory explanation of the different objects that strike the eye of the
admiring spectator as he traverses the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. It is by no means
my intention to transcribe this catalogue, or to mention every statue; but,
assisted by the valuable observations with which I was favoured by the learned
antiquary, VISCONTI, long distinguished for his profound knowledge of the fine
arts, I shall describe the most remarkable only, and such as would fix the
attention of the connoisseur.</p>
<p>On entering the gallery, you might, perhaps, be tempted to stop in the first
hall; but we will visit them all in regular succession, and proceed to that
which is now the furthest on the left hand. The ceiling of this apartment,
painted by ROMANELLI, represents the four seasons; whence it is called the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE SEASONS.</p>
<p>In consequence, among other antiques, here are placed the statues of the
rustic divinities, and those relating to the Seasons. Of the whole, I shall
distinguish the following:</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">N&deg; 210.</td><td>DIANA.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Diana, habited as a huntress, in a short tunic without sleeves, is holding
her bow in one hand; while, with the other, she is drawing an arrow from her
quiver, which is suspended at her shoulder. Her legs are bare, and her feet are
adorned with rich sandals. The goddess, with a look expressive of indignation,
appears to be defending the fabulous hind from the pursuit of Hercules, who, in
obedience to the oracle of Apollo, was pursuing it, in order to carry it alive
to Eurystheus; a task imposed on him by the latter as one of his twelve
labours.</p>
<p>To say that, in the opinion of the first-rate connoisseurs, this statue
might serve as a companion to the <i>Apollo of Belvedere</i>, is sufficient to
convey an idea of its perfection; and, in fact, it is reckoned the finest
representation of Diana in existence. It is of Parian marble, and, according to
historians, has been in France ever since the reign of Henry IV. It was the
most perfect of the antiques which adorned the Gallery of Versailles. The parts
wanting have been recently restored with such skill as to claim particular
admiration.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;214.</td><td>ROME.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In this bust, the city of Rome is personified as an Amazon. The helmet of
the female warrior is adorned with a representation of the she-wolf, suckling
the children of Mars.</p>
<p>This antique, of Parian marble, is of a perfect Greek style, and in
admirable preservation. It formerly belonged to the Gallery of
Richelieu-Castle.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.</td><td>ADOLESCENS SPINAM
AVELLENS.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This bronze figure represents a young man seated, who seems employed in
extracting a thorn from his left foot.</p>
<p>It is a production of the flourishing period of the art, but, according to
appearance, anterior to the reign of Alexander the Great. It partakes a little
of the meagre style of the old Greek school; but, at the same time, is finished
with astonishing truth, and exhibits a graceful simplicity of expression. In
what place it was originally discovered is not known. It was taken from the
Capitol, where it was seen in the <i>Palazzo dei Conservatori</i>.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.</td><td>A FAUN, <i>in a resting
posture</i>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This young faun, with no other covering than a deer's skin thrown over his
shoulders, is standing with his legs crossed, and leaning on the trunk of a
tree, as if resting himself.</p>
<p>The grace and finished execution that reign throughout this figure, as well
as the immense number of copies still existing of it, and all antiques,
occasion it to be considered as the copy of the Faun in bronze, (or Satyr as it
is termed by the Greeks), of Praxiteles. That statue was so celebrated, that
the epithet of
<i>&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&zeta;&omicron;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>, or
the famous, became its distinctive appellation throughout Greece.</p>
<p>This Faun is of Pentelic marble: it was found in 1701, near <i>Civita
Lavinia</i>, and placed in the Capitol by Benedict XIV.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.</td><td>ARIADNE, <i>known by the name
of</i> CLEOPATRA.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In this beautiful figure, Ariadne is represented asleep on a rock in the
Isle of Naxos, abandoned by the faithless Theseus, and at the moment when
Bacchus became enamoured of her, as described by several ancient poets.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how the expression of sleep could be mistaken for that of
death, and cause this figure to be called <i>Cleopatra</i>. The serpent on the
upper part of the left arm is evidently a bracelet, of that figure which the
Greek women called <i>&omicron;&phi;&iota;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</i>, or
the little serpent.</p>
<p>For three successive centuries, this statue of Parian marble constituted one
of the principal ornaments of the Belvedere of the Vatican, where it was placed
by Julius II.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190.</td><td>AUGUSTUS.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This head of Augustus, adorned with the civic crown of oak leaves, is one of
the fine portraits of that emperor. It is executed in Parian marble, and comes
from Verona, where it was admired in the <i>Bevilacqua</i> cabinet.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>On quitting the HALL OF THE SEASONS, we return to that through which we
first passed to reach it. This apartment, from being ornamented with the
statues of ZENO, TRAJAN, DEMOSTHENES, and PHOCION, is denominated the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN.</p>
<p>It is decorated with eight antique granite pillars brought from
<i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>, where they stood in the nave of the church, which
contained the tomb of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Among the antiques placed in it, I shall particularize</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">N&deg; 75.</td><td>MENANDER.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This figure represents the poet, honoured by the Greeks with the title of
<i>Prince of the New Comedy</i>, sitting on a hemi-cycle, or semicircular seat,
and resting after his literary labours. He is clad in the Grecian tunic and
<i>pallium</i>.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76.</td><td>POSIDIPPUS.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The dress of Posidippus, who was reckoned among the Greeks one of the best
authors of what was called the <i>New Comedy</i>, is nearly that of Menander,
the poet. Like him, he is represented sitting on a hemi-cycle.</p>
<p>These two statues, which are companions, are admirable for the noble
simplicity of their execution. They are both of Pentelic marble, and were found
in the XVIth century at Rome, in the gardens of the convent of <i>San
Lorenzo</i>, on Mount Viminal. After making part of the baths of Olympius, they
were placed by Sixtus V. at <i>Negroni</i>, whence they were removed to the
Vatican by Pius VI.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>Continuing our examination, after leaving the HALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN, we
next come to the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE ROMANS.</p>
<p>The ceiling of this hall is ornamented with subjects taken from the Roman
history, painted by ROMANELLI; and in it are chiefly assembled such works of
sculpture as have a relation to that people.</p>
<p>Among several busts and statues, representing ADRIAN, PUBLIUS CORNELIUS
SCIPIO, MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, &amp;c. I shall
point out to your notice,</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;209.</td><td><i>The</i> TORSO <i>of</i>
BELVEDERE.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This admirable remnant of a figure seated, though the head, arms, and legs
are wanting, represents the apotheosis of Hercules. The lion's skin spread on
the rock, and the enormous size of the limbs, leave no doubt as to the subject
of the statue. Notwithstanding the muscles are strongly marked, the veins in
the body of the hero are suppressed, whence antiquaries have inferred, that the
intention of the author was to indicate the very moment of his deification.
According to this idea, our countryman FLAXMAN has immortalized himself by
restoring a copy of the <i>Torso</i>, and placing Hebe on the left of Hercules,
in the act of presenting to him the cup of immortality.</p>
<p>On the rock, where the figure is seated, is the following Greek
inscription:</p>

Athenian, the son of Nestor</i>, who, probably, flourished in the time of
Pompey the Great.</p>
<p>This valuable antique is of Pentelic marble, and sculptured in a most
masterly style. It was found at Rome, near Pompey's theatre, now <i>Campo di
Fiore</i>. Julius II. placed it in the garden of the Vatican, where it was long
the object of the studies of MICHAEL ANGELO, RAPHAEL, &amp;c. those illustrious
geniuses, to whom we are indebted for the improvement of the fine arts. Among
artists, it has always been distinguished by the appellation of the <i>Torso of
Belvedere</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="let08">LETTER VIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 29, 1801.</i></p>
<p>If the culture of the arts, by promoting industry and increasing commerce,
improves civilization, and refines manners, what modern people can boast of
such advantages as are now enjoyed by the French nation? While the sciences
keep pace with the arts, good taste bids fair to spread, in time, from the
capital throughout the country, and to become universal among them. In
antiquity, Athens attests the truth of this proposition, by rising, through the
same means, above all the cities of Greece; and, in modern times, have we not
seen in Florence, become opulent, the darkness of ignorance vanish, like a fog,
before the bright rays of knowledge, diffused by the flourishing progress of
the arts and sciences?</p>
<p>When I closed my letter yesterday, we had just terminated our examination of
the HALL OF THE ROMANS. On the same line with it, the next apartment we reach,
taking its name from the celebrated group here placed, is styled the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE LAOCOON.</p>
<p>Here are to be admired four pillars of <i>verde antico</i>, a species of
green marble, obtained by the ancients, from the environs of Thessalonica. They
were taken from the church of <i>Montmorency</i>, where they decorated the tomb
of Anne, the constable of that name. The first three apartments are floored
with inlaid oak; but this is paved with beautiful marble.</p>
<p>Of the <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> exhibited in this hall, every person of
taste cannot but feel particular gratification in examining the
undermentioned;</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">N&deg; 108.</td><td>LAOCOON.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The pathetic story which forms the subject of this admirable group is known
to every classic reader. It is considered as one of the most perfect works that
ever came from the chisel; being at once a master-piece of composition, design,
and feeling. Any sort of commentary could but weaken the impression which it
makes on the beholder.</p>
<p>It was found in 1506, under the pontificate of Julius II, at Rome, on Mount
Esquiline, in the ruins of the palace of Titus. The three Rhodian artists,
AGESANDER, POLYDORUS, and ATHENOPORUS, mentioned by Pliny, as the sculptors of
this <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> flourished during the time of the Emperors, in
the first century of the Christian era.</p>
<p>The group is composed of five blocks, but joined in so skilful a manner,
that Pliny thought them of one single piece. The right arm of the father and
two arms of the children are wanting.</p>

<p>This uncommonly beautiful figure of Parian marble represents a woman, whose
feminine features and form seem to have contracted the impression of the
masculine habits of warfare. Clad in a very fine tunic, which, leaving the left
breast exposed, is tucked up on the hips, she is in the act of bending a large
bow. No attitude could be better calculated for exhibiting to advantage the
finely-modelled person of this heroine.</p>
<p>For two centuries, this statue was at the <i>Villa-Mattei</i>, on Mount
C&oelig;lius at Rome, whence it was removed to the Museum of the Vatican by
Clement XIV.</p>

ravaging his dominions; at his side is the head of the animal, and near him
sits his faithful dog.</p>
<p>The beauty of this group is sublime, and yet it is of a different cast, from
either that of the <i>Apollo of Belvedere</i>, or that of the <i>Mercury</i>,
called Antinoüs, of which we shall presently have occasion to speak.</p>
<p>This group is of Greek marble of a cinereous colour: there are two different
traditions respecting the place where it was found; but the preference is given
to that of Aldroandi, who affirms that it was discovered in a vineyard
bordering on the Tiber. It belonged to Fusconi, physician to Paul III, and was
for a long time in the <i>Pighini</i> palace at Rome, whence Clement XIV had it
conveyed to the Vatican.</p>

<p>Whichever it may be, it is of Pentelic marble, and unquestionably one of the
most sublime productions of the chisel, in point of <i>ideal</i> beauty.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>From the HALL OF THE LAOCOON, we pass into the apartment, which, from the
famous statue, here erected, and embellished in the most splendid manner, takes
the appellation of the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE APOLLO.</p>
<p>This hall is ornamented with four pillars of red oriental granite of the
finest quality: those which decorate the niche of the Apollo were taken from
the church that contained the tomb of Charlemagne at <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>.
The floor is paved with different species of scarce and valuable marble, in
large compartments, and, in its centre, is placed a large octagonal table of
the same substance.</p>
<p>In proportion to the dimensions of this apartment, which is considerably
larger than any of the others, a greater number of antiques are here placed, of
which the following are the most pre-eminent.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">N&deg; 145.</td><td>APOLLO PYTHIUS, <i>commonly called
the</i> APOLLO OF BELVEDERE.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The name alone of this <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> might be said to contain
its eulogium. But as you may, probably, expect from me some remarks on it, I
shall candidly acknowledge that I can do no better than communicate to you the
able and interesting description given of it by the Administration of the
Museum, of which the following is a fair abridgment.</p>
<p>"Apollo has just discharged the mortal arrow which has struck the serpent
Python, while ravaging Delphi. In his left hand is held his formidable bow; his
right has but an instant quitted it: all his members still preserve the
impression given them by this action. Indignation is seated on his lips; but in
his looks is the assurance of success. His hair, slightly curled, floats in
long ringlets round his neck, or is gracefully turned up on the crown of his
head, which is encircled by the <i>strophium</i>, or fillet, characteristic of
kings and gods. His quiver is suspended by a belt to the right shoulder: his
feet are adorned with rich sandals. His <i>chlamis</i> fastened on the
shoulder, and tucked up only on the left arm, is thrown back, as if to display
the majesty of his divine form to greater advantage.</p>
<p>"An eternal youth is spread over all his beautiful figure, a sublime mixture
of nobleness and agility, of vigour and elegance, and which holds a happy
medium between the delicate form of Bacchus, and the more manly one of
Mercury."</p>
<p>This inimitable master-piece is of Carrara marble, and, consequently, was
executed by some Greek artist who lived in the time of the Romans; but the name
of its author is entirely unknown. The fore-arm and the left hand, which were
wanting, were restored by GIOVANNI ANGELO DE MONTORSOLI, a sculptor, who was a
pupil of Michael Angelo.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century, it was discovered at <i>Capo
d'Anzo</i>, twelve leagues from Rome, on the sea-shore, near the ruins of the
ancient <i>Antium</i>. Julius II, when cardinal, purchased this statue, and
placed it in his palace; but shortly after, having arrived at the pontificate,
he had it conveyed to the Belvedere of the Vatican, where, for three centuries,
it was the admiration of the world.</p>
<p>On the 16th of Brumaire, year IX, (7th of November, 1801) BONAPARTE, as
First Consul, celebrated, in great pomp, the inauguration of the Apollo; on
which occasion he placed between the plinth of the statue, and its pedestal, a
brass tablet bearing a suitable inscription.</p>
<p>The Apollo stands facing the entrance-door of the apartment, in an elevated
recess, decorated, as I have before observed, with beautiful granite pillars.
The flight of steps, leading to this recess, is paved with the rarest marble,
inlaid with squares of curious antique mosaic, and on them are placed two
Egyptian sphynxes of red oriental granite, taken from the Museum of the
Vatican.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;142.</td><td>VENUS OF THE
CAPITOL.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This figure of Parian marble represents the goddess of beauty issuing from
the bath. Her charms are not concealed by any veil or garment. She is slightly
turning her head to the left, as if to smile on the Graces, who are supposed to
be preparing to attire her.</p>
<p>In point of execution, this is allowed to be the most beautiful of all the
statues of Venus which we have remaining. The <i>Venus of Medicis</i> surpasses
it in sublimity of form, approaching nearer to <i>ideal</i> beauty.</p>
<p>Bupalus, a sculptor of the Isle of Scio, is said to have produced this
master-piece. He lived 600 years before Christ, so that it has now been in
existence upwards of two thousand four hundred years. It was found about the
middle of the eighteenth century, near <i>San-Vitale</i>, at Rome. Benedict XIV
having purchased it of the <i>Stati</i> family, placed it in the Capitol.</p>

<p>This statue, also of the finest Parian marble, is one of the most beautiful
that can be imagined. More robust in form than either that of the <i>Apollo</i>
or of the <i>Meleager</i>, it loses nothing by being contemplated after the
former. In short, the harmony which reigns between its parts is such, that the
celebrated POUSSIN, in preference to every other, always took from it the
<i>proportions of the human figure</i>.</p>
<p>It was found at Rome, on Mount Esquiline, under the pontificate of Paul III,
who placed it in the Belvedere of the Vatican, near the Apollo and the
Laocoon.</p>

<tr><td width="20%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;151.</td><td><i>The Egyptian</i>
ANTINOÜS.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In this statue, Antinoüs is represented as a divinity of Egypt. He is
standing in the usual attitude of the Egyptian gods, and is naked, with the
exception of his head and wrist, which are covered with a species of drapery in
imitation of the sacred garments.</p>
<p>This beautiful figure is wrought with superior excellence. It is of white
marble, which leads to a conjecture that it might have been intended to
represent Orus, the god of light, it having been the custom of the Egyptians to
represent all their other divinities in coloured marble. It was discovered in
1738, at Tivoli, in the <i>Villa-Adriana</i>, and taken from the Museum of the
Capitol.</p>
<p>To judge from the great number of figures of Antinoüs, sculptured by order
of Adrian to perpetuate the memory of that favourite, the emperor's gratitude
for him must have been unbounded. Under the form of different divinities, or at
different periods of life, there are at present in the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES no
less than five portraits of him, besides three statues and two busts. Three
other statues of Antinoüs, together with a bust, and an excellent bass-relief,
in which he is represented, yet remain to be placed.</p>

of the finest extant of the mirth-inspiring deity.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>Having surveyed every object deserving of notice in the HALL OF THE APOLLO,
we proceed, on the right hand, towards its extremity, and reach the last
apartment of the gallery, which, from being consecrated to the tuneful Nine, is
called the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE MUSES.</p>
<p>It is paved with curious marble, and independently of the Muses, and their
leader, Apollo, here are also assembled the antique portraits of poets and
philosophers who have rendered themselves famous by cultivating them. Among
these we may perceive HOMER and VIRGIL; but the most remarkable specimen of the
art is</p>

<tr><td width="20%">N&deg; 177.</td><td>EURIPIDES.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In this hermes we have a capital representation of the features of the rival
of Sophocles. The countenance is at once noble, serious, and expressive. It
bears the stamp of the genius of that celebrated tragic poet, which was
naturally sublime and profound, though inclined to the pathetic.</p>
<p>This hermes is executed in Pentelic marble, and was taken from the academy
of <i>Mantua</i>.</p>
<p>Since the revival of the arts, the lovers of antiquity have made repeated
attempts to form a collection of antique statues of the Muses; but none was
ever so complete as that assembled in the Museum of the Vatican by Pius VI, and
which the chance of war has now transferred to the banks of the Seine. Here the
bard may offer up to them a solemn invocation, and compose his lay, as it were,
under their very eyes.</p>
<p>The statues of CLIO, THALIA, TERPSICHORE, ERATO, POLYHYMNIA, and CALLIOPE,
together with the APOLLO MUSAGETES, were discovered in 1774, at <i>Tivoli</i>,
among the ruins of the villa of Cassius. To complete the number, Pius VI
obtained the EUTERPE and the URANIA from the <i>Lancellotti</i> palace at
<i>Veletri</i>. They are supposed to be antique copies of the statues of the
Nine Muses by Philiscus, which, according to Pliny, graced the portico of
Octavia.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>The air of grandeur that reigns in the general arrangement of the gallery is
very striking: and the tasteful and judicious distribution of this matchless
assemblage of antiques does great honour to the Council of the CENTRAL MUSEUM.
Among the riches which Rome possessed, the French commissioners also, by their
choice selection, have manifested the depth of their knowledge, and the
justness of their discrimination.</p>
<p>The alterations and embellishments made in the different apartments of the
GALLERY OF ANTIQUES have been executed under the immediate direction of their
author, M. RAYMOND, member of the National Institute, and architect to the
NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES. In winter, the apartments are kept warm
by means of flues, which diffuse a genial vapour. Here, without the expense of
a single <i>liard</i>, the young draughtsman may form his taste by studying the
true antique models of Grecian sculpture; the more experienced artist may
consult them as he finds occasion in the composition of his subjects; while the
connoisseur, the amateur, or the simple observer may spend many an agreeable
hour in contemplating these master-pieces which, for centuries, have inspired
universal admiration.</p>
<p>These are the materials on which Genius ought to work, and without which the
most promising talent may be greatly misapplied, if not entirely lost. It was
by studying closely these correct models, that the great MICHAEL ANGELO, the,
sublime RAPHAEL, and other eminent masters, acquired that idea of excellence
which is the result of the accumulated experience of successive ages. Here, in
one visit, the student may imbibe those principles to ascertain which many
artists have consumed the best part of their days; and penetrated by their
effect, he is spared the laborious investigation by which they came to be known
and established. It is unnecessary to expatiate on the advantages which the
fine arts may expect to derive from such a repository of antiques in a capital
so centrical as Paris. The contemplation of them cannot fail to fire the genius
of any artist of taste, and prompt his efforts towards the attainment of that
grand style, which, disdaining the minute accidental particularities of
individual objects, improves partial representation by the general and
invariable ideas of nature.</p>
<p>A vast collection of antiquities of every description is still expected from
Italy, among which are the <i>Venus of Medicis</i> and the <i>Pallas of
Veletri</i>, a finely-preserved statue, classed by artists among those of the
first rank, dug up at <i>Veletri</i> in 1799, in consequence of the researches
made there by order of the French commissioners. Upwards of five hundred cases
were lying on the banks of the Tiber, at Rome, ready to be sent off to France,
when the Neapolitans entered that city. They carried them all away: but by the
last article of the treaty of peace with the king of Naples, the whole of them
are to be restored to the French Republic. For the purpose of verifying their
condition, and taking measures for their conveyance to Paris, two commissioners
have been dispatched to Italy: one is the son of CHAPTAL, Minister of the
Interior, and the other is DUFOURNY, the architect. On the arrival of these
cases, even after the fifteen departmental Museums have been supplied, it is
asserted that there will yet remain in the French capital, antiquities in
sufficient number to form a museum almost from Paris to Versailles.</p>
<p><a name="let08fr1"></a>The CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS is open to the public
in general on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of each decade;[<a href="#let08f1">1</a>]
the other days are appropriated to the study of young pupils; but a foreigner
has only to produce his <i>permis de séjour</i> to gain admission <i>gratis</i>
every day from the hour of ten o'clock to four. To the credit of the nation, I
must observe that this exception in favour of foreigners excites no jealousy
whatever.</p>
<p>It is no more than a justice due to the liberality of the French republican
government to add, that they set a noble example which is worthy of being
followed, not only in England, but in every other country, where the arts and
sciences are honoured, or the general interests of mankind held in estimation.
From persons visiting any national establishment, whether museum, library,
cabinet, or garden, in this capital, no sort of fee or perquisite is now
expected, or allowed to be taken. Although it was not a public day when I paid
my first visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM, no sooner did I shew my <i>permis de
séjour</i>, than the doors were thrown open; and from M. VISCONTI, and other
members of the Council, who happened to be present, I experienced the most
polite and obliging attention. As an Englishman, I confess that I felt a degree
of shame on reflecting to what pitiful exaction a foreigner would be subject,
who might casually visit any public object of curiosity in our metropolis.</p>

<h2><a name="let10">LETTER IX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, October 31, 1801.</i></p>
<p>In answer to your question, I shall begin by informing you that I have not
set eyes on the <i>petit caporal</i>, as some affect to style the Chief Consul.
He spends much of his time, I am told, at <i>Malmaison</i>, his country-seat;
and seldom appears in public, except in his box at the Opera, or at the French
theatre; but at the grand monthly parade, I shall be certain to behold him, on
the 15th of the present month of Brumaire, according to the republican
calendar, which day answers to the 6th of November. I have therefore to check
my impatience for a week longer.</p>
<p>However, if I have not yet seen BONAPARTE himself, I have at least seen a
person who has seen him, and will take care that I shall have an opportunity of
seeing him too: this person is no less than a general&mdash;who accompanied him
in his expedition to Egypt&mdash;who was among the chosen few that returned
with him from that country&mdash;who there surveyed the mouths of the
Nile&mdash;who served under him in the famous campaign of Syria; and who at
this day is one of the first military engineers in Europe. In a word, it is
General A----y, of the artillery, at present Director of that scientific
establishment, called the DÉPÔT DE LA GUERRE. He invited me the day before
yesterday to breakfast, with a view of meeting some of his friends whom he had
purposely assembled.</p>
<p>I am not fond of breakfasting from home; <i>mais il faut vivre à Rome comme
à Rome</i>. Between ten and eleven o'clock I reached the <i>Dépôt</i>, which is
situated in the <i>Rue de l'Université</i>, <i>Faubourg St, Germain</i>, at the
<i>ci-devant Hôtel d'Harcourt</i>, formerly belonging to the duke of that name.
Passing through the gate-way, I was proceeding boldly to the principal entrance
of the hotel, when a sentinel stopped me short by charging his bayonet.
"Citizen," said he fiercely, at the same time pointing to the lodge on the
right, "you must speak to the porter." I accordingly obeyed the mandate.
"What's your business, citizen?" inquired the porter gruffly.&mdash;"My
business, citizen," replied I, "is only to breakfast with the
general."&mdash;"Be so good, citizen," rejoined he in a milder tone, "as to
take the trouble to ascend the grand stair-case, and ring the bell on the
first-floor."</p>
<p>Being introduced into the general's apartments, I there found eight or ten
persons of very intelligent aspect, seated at a round table, loaded with all
sorts of good things, but, in my mind, better calculated for dinner than
breakfast. Among a great variety of delicacies, were beef-steaks, or, as they
are here termed, <i>bif-ticks à l'Anglaise</i>. Oysters too were not forgotten:
indeed, they compose an essential part of a French breakfast; and the ladies
seem particularly partial to them, I suppose, because they are esteemed
strengthening to a delicate constitution.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more pleasant than this party. Most of the guests were
distinguished literati, or military men of no ordinary stamp. One of the
latter, a <i>chef de brigade</i> of engineers, near whom I considered myself
fortunate in being placed, spoke to me in the highest terms of Mr. SPENCER
SMITH, Sir Sidney's brother, to whose interference at <i>Constantinople</i>, he
was indebted for his release from a Turkish prison.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the continual clatter of knives and forks, and the
occasional gingle of glasses, the conversation, which suffered no interruption,
was to me extremely interesting: I never heard any men express opinions more
liberal on every subject that was started. It was particularly gratifying to my
feelings, as an Englishman, to hear a set of French gentlemen, some of whom had
participated in the sort of disgrace attached to the raising of the siege of
<i>St. Jean d'Acre</i>, generously bestow just encomiums on my brother-officer,
to whose heroism they owed their failure. Addison, I think, says, somewhere in
the Spectator, that national prejudice is a laudable partiality; but, however
laudable it may be to indulge such a partiality, it ought not to render us
blind to the merit of individuals of a rival nation.</p>
<p>General A----y, being one of those whose talents have been found too useful
to the State to be suffered to remain in inaction, was obliged to attend at the
<i>Conseil des Mines</i> soon after twelve o'clock, when the party separated.
Just as I was taking leave, he did me the favour to put into my hand a copy of
his <i>Histoire du Canal du Midi</i>, of which I shall say more when I have had
leisure to peruse it.</p>
<p>I do not know that a man in good health, who takes regular exercise, is the
worse for breakfasting on a beef-steak, in the long-exploded style of Queen
Bess; but I am no advocate for all the accessories of a French <i>déjeûner à la
fourchette</i>. The strong Mocha coffee which I swallowed, could not check the
more powerful effect of the Madeira and <i>crème de rose</i>. I therefore
determined on taking a long walk, which, when saddle-horses are not to be
procured, I have always found the best remedy for the kind of restlessness
created by such a breakfast.</p>
<p>I accordingly directed my steps across the <i>Pont &amp; Place de la
Concorde</i>, traversed the street of the same name; and, following the
<i>Boulevard</i> for a certain distance, struck off to the left, that is,
towards the north, in order to gain the summit of</p>
<p class="center">MONTMARTRE.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there stood on this hill a temple dedicated to Mars,
whence the name <i>Mons Martis</i>, of which has been made <i>Montmartre</i>.
At the foot of it, was the <i>Campus Martius</i>, or <i>Champ de Mars</i>,
where the French kings of the first race caused their throne to be erected
every year on the first of May. They came hither in a car, decorated with green
boughs and flowers, and drawn by four oxen. Such, indeed, was the town-equipage
of king DAGOBERT.</p>
<p class="bq">"Quatre b&oelig;ufs attelés, d'un pas tranquil et lent,<br />
Promenaient dans Paris le monarque indolent."</p>
<p>Having seated themselves on the throne, they gave a public audience to the
people, at the same time giving and receiving presents, which were called
<i>estrennes</i>. Hence annual presents were afterwards termed <i>étrennes</i>,
and this gave rise to the custom of making them.</p>
<p>On this hill too fell the head of
<i>&Delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i> or
<i>St. Denis</i>; and in latter times, this was the spot chosen by the Marshal
DE BROGLIE, who commanded the thirty-five thousand troops by which the French
capital was surrounded in May 1789, for checking the spirit of the turbulent
Parisians, by battering their houses' about their ears, and burying them under
the ruins.</p>
<p>On the summit of <i>Montmartre</i>, is a circular terrace, in the centre of
which stands a windmill, and not far from it, are several others. Round its
brow are several <i>maisonettes</i>, or little country boxes, and also some
public gardens with bowers, where lovers often regale their mistresses. Hence
you command a full view of the city of Paris. You behold roof rising above
roof; and the churches towering above the houses have, at this distance,
somewhat the appearance of lofty chimnies. You look down on the capital as far
as the Seine, by which it is intersected: beyond that river, the surface of the
land rises again in the form of an amphitheatre. On all sides, the prospect is
bounded by eminences of various degrees of elevation, over which, as well as
over the plains, and along the banks of the river, are scattered villas,
windmills, country-seats, hamlets, villages, and coppices; but, from want of
enclosures, the circumjacent country has not that rich and variegated aspect
which delights the eye in our English rural scenery. This was always one of my
favourite walks during my residence in Paris before the revolution; and I doubt
not, when you visit the French capital, that you will have the curiosity to
scale the heights of <i>Montmartre</i>.</p>
<p>As to the theatres, concerning which you interrogate me, I shall defer
entering into any particular detail of them, till I have made myself fully
acquainted with the attractions of each: this mode of proceeding will not
occasion any material delay, as I generally visit one of them every evening,
but always endeavour to go to that house where the <i>best</i> performers are
to be seen, in their <i>best</i> characters, and in the <i>best</i> pieces. I
mention this, in order that you may not think me inattentive to your request,
by having hitherto omitted to point out to you the difference between the
theatrical amusements here under the monarchy, and those of the republic.</p>
<p>The <i>thèâtre des arts</i> or grand French opera, the <i>opera buffa</i> or
Italian comic opera, the <i>théâtre Feydeau</i> or French comic opera, and the
<i>théâtre Français</i>, chiefly engage my attention. Yesterday evening I went
to the last-mentioned theatre purposely to see Mademoiselle CONTAT, who played
in both pieces. The first was <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>, a comedy, in which
Molière, wishing to aim a blow at female pedantry, has, perhaps, checked, in
some French women, a desire for improvement; the second was <i>La fausse
Agnès</i>, a laughable afterpiece. Notwithstanding the enormous
<i>embonpoint</i> which this celebrated comic actress has acquired since I saw
her last on the Parisian stage upwards of ten years ago, she acquitted herself
with her accustomed excellence. I happened to sit next to a very warm admirer
of her superior talents, who told me that, bulky as she was become, he had been
highly gratified in seeing her perform at <i>Rouen</i> not long since, in her
favourite character of <i>Roxalane</i>, in <i>Les Trois Sultanes</i>. "She was
much applauded, no doubt." observed I.&mdash;"Not at all," replied he, "for the
crowd was so great, that in no part of the house was it possible for a man to
use his hands."</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let10">LETTER X.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 2, 1801.</i></p>
<p>On reaching Paris, every person, whether Jew or Gentile, foreigner or not,
coming from any department of the republic, except that of <i>La Seine</i>, in
which the capital is situated, is now bound to make his appearance at the
<i>Préfecture de Police</i>.</p>
<p>The new-comer, accompanied by two housekeepers, first repairs to the
Police-office of the <i>arrondissement</i>, or district, in which he has taken
up his residence, where he delivers his travelling passport; in lieu of which
he receives a sort of certificate, and then he shews himself at the
<i>Préfecture de Police</i>, or General Police-office, at present established
in the <i>Cité</i>.</p>
<p>Here, his name and quality, together with a minute description of his person
and his place of abode, are inserted in a register kept for that purpose, to
which he puts his signature; and a printed paper, commonly called a <i>permis
de séjour</i>, is given to him, containing a duplicate of all these matters,
filled up in the blanks, which he also signs himself. It is intended that he
should always carry this paper about him, in order that he may produce it when
called on, or, in case of necessity, for verifying his person, on any
particular occasion, such as passing by a guard-house on foot after eleven
o'clock at night, or being unexpectedly involved in any affray. In a word, it
answers to a stranger the same end as a <i>carte de sureté</i>, or ticket of
safety, does to an inhabitant of Paris.</p>
<p>I accordingly went through this indispensable ceremony in due form on my
arrival here; but, having neglected to read a <i>nota bene</i> in the margin of
the <i>permis de séjour</i>, I had not been ten hours in my new apartments
before I received a visit from an Inspector of Police of the
<i>arrondissement</i>, who, very civilly reminding me of the omission, told me
that I need not give myself the trouble of going to the Central Police-office,
as he would report my removal. However, being determined to be strictly <i>en
règle</i>, I went thither myself to cause my new residence to be inserted in
the paper.</p>
<p>I should not have dwelt on the circumstance, were it not to shew you the
precision observed in the administration of the police of this great city.</p>
<p>Under the old <i>régime</i>, every master of a ready-furnished hotel was
obliged to keep a register, in which he inserted the name and quality of his
lodgers for the inspection of the police-officers whenever they came: this
regulation is not only strictly adhered to at present; but every person in
Paris, who receives a stranger under his roof as an inmate, is bound, under
penalty of a fine, to report him to the police, which is most vigilantly
administered by Citizen FOUCHÉ.</p>
<p>Last night, not being in time to find good places at the <i>Théâtre des
Arts</i>, or Grand French Opera, I went to the <i>Théâtre Louvois</i>, which is
within a few paces of it, in hopes of being more successful. I shall not at
present attempt to describe the house, as, from my arriving late, I was too ill
accommodated to be able to view it to advantage.</p>
<p>However, I was well seated for seeing the performance. It consisted of three
<i>petites pièces</i>: namely, <i>Une heure d'absence</i>, <i>La petite
ville</i>, and <i>Le café d'une petite ville</i>. The first was entertaining;
but the second much more so; and though the third cannot claim the merit of
being well put together, I shall say a few words of it, as it is a production
<i>in honour of peace</i>, and on that score alone, would, at this juncture,
deserve notice.</p>
<p>After a few scenes somewhat languid, interspersed with common-place, and
speeches of no great humour, a <i>dénouement</i>, by no means interesting,
promised not to compensate the audience for their patience. But the author of
the <i>Café d'une petite ville</i>, having eased himself of this burden,
revealed his motive, and took them on their weak side, by making a strong
appeal to French enthusiasm. This cord being adroitly struck, his warmth became
communicative, and animating the actors, good humor did the rest. The
accessories were infinitely more interesting than the main subject. An
allemande, gracefully danced by two damsels and a hero, in the character of a
French hussar, returned home from the fatigues of war and battle, was much
applauded; and a Gascoon poet, who declares that, for once in his life, he is
resolved to speak truth, was loudly encored in the following couplets, adapted
to the well-known air of <i>"Gai, le c&oelig;ur à la danse."</i></p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Celui qui nous donne la paix,<br />
Comme il fit bien la guerre!<br />
Sur lui déjà force conplets....<br />
Mai il en reste à faire:<br />
Au diable nous nous donnions,<br />
Il revient, nous respirons....<br />
Il fait changer la danse;<br />
Par lui chez nous plus de discord;<br />
Il regle la cadence,<br />
Et nous voilà d'accord."</i></p>
<p>True it is, that BONAPARTE, as principal ballet-master, has changed the
dance of the whole nation; he regulates their step to the measure of his own
music, and <i>discord</i> is mute at the moment: but the question is, whether
the French are bona-fide <i>d'accord</i>, (as the Gascoon affirms,) that is,
perfectly reconciled to the new tune and figure? Let us, however, keep out of
this maze; were we to enter it, we might remain bewildered there, perhaps, till
old Father Time came to extricate us.</p>
<p>The morning is inviting: suppose we take a turn in the <i>Tuileries</i>, not
with a view of surveying this garden, but merely to breathe the fresh air, and
examine the</p>
<p class="center">PALAIS DU GOUVERNEMENT.</p>
<p>Since the Chief Consul has made it his town-residence, this is the new
denomination given to the <i>Palais des Tuileries</i>, thus called, because a
tile-kiln formerly stood on the site where it is erected. At that time, this
part of Paris was not comprised within its walls, nothing was to be seen here,
in the vicinity of the tile-kiln, but a few coppices and scattered
habitations.</p>
<p>Catherine de Medicis, wishing to enlarge the capital on this side, visited
the spot, and liking the situation, directed PHILIBERT DE L'ORME and JEAN
BULLAN, two celebrated French architects, to present her with a plan, from
which the construction of this palace was begun in May 1564. At first, it
consisted only of the large square pavilion in the centre of the two piles of
building, which have each a terrace towards the garden, and of the two
pavilions by which they are terminated.</p>
<p>Henry IV enlarged the original building, and, in 1600, began the grand
gallery which joins it to the <i>Louvre</i>, from the plan of DU CERCEAU. Lewis
XIII made some alterations in the palace; and in 1664, exactly a century from
the date of its construction being begun, Lewis XIV directed LOUIS DE VEAU to
finish it, by making the additions and embellishments which have brought it to
its present state. These deviations from the first plan have destroyed the
proportions required by the strict rules of art; but this defect would,
probably, be overlooked by those who are not connoisseurs, as the architecture,
though variously blended, presents, at first sight, an <i>ensemble</i> which is
magnificent and striking.</p>
<p>The whole front of the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i> consists of five
pavilions, connected by four piles of building, standing on the same line, and
extending for the space of one thousand and eleven feet. The first order of the
three middle piles is Ionic, with encircled columns. The two adjoining
pavilions are also ornamented with Ionic pillars; but fluted, and embellished
with foliage, from the third of their height to the summit. The second order of
these two pavilions is Corinthian. The two piles of building, which come next,
as well as the two pavilions of the wings, are of a Composite order with fluted
pillars. From a tall iron spindle, placed on the pinnacle of each of the three
principal pavilions is now seen floating a horizontal tri-coloured streamer.
Till the improvements made by Lewis XIV, the large centre pavilion had been
decorated with the Ionic and Corinthian orders only, to these was added the
Composite.</p>
<p>On the façade towards the <i>Place du Carrousel</i>, the pillars of all
these orders are of brown and red marble. Here may be observed the marks of
several cannon-balls, beneath each of which is inscribed, in black, 10
AOÛT.</p>
<p>This tenth of August 1792, a day ever memorable in the history of France,
has furnished many an able writer with the subject of an episode; but, I
believe, few of them were, any more than myself, actors in that dreadful scene.
While I was intently remarking the particular impression of a shot which struck
the edge of one of the casements of the first floor of the palace, my <i>valet
de place</i> came up to know at which door I would have the carriage remain in
waiting.</p>
<p>On turning round, I fancied I beheld the man who "drew Priam's curtain in
the dead of night." That messenger, I am sure, could not have presented a
visage more pale, more spiritless than my Helvetian. Recollecting that he had
served in the Swiss guards, I was the less at a loss to account for his extreme
agitation. "In what part of the <i>château</i> were you, Jean," said I, "when
these balls were aimed at the windows?"----"There was my post," replied he,
recovering himself, and pointing to one of the centre casements.&mdash;"Is it
true," continued I, "that, by way of feigning a reconciliation, you threw down
cartridges by handfuls to the Marseillese below, and called out; <i>vive la
nation?"</i>----"It is but too true," answered Jean; "we then availed ourselves
of the moment when they advanced under the persuasion that they were to become
our friends, and opened on them a tremendous fire, by which we covered the
place with dead and dying. But we became victims of our own treachery: for our
ammunition being, by this <i>ruse de guerre</i>, the sooner expended, we
presently had no resource left but the bayonet, by which we could not prevent
the mob from closing on us."&mdash;"And how did you contrive to escape," said
I?&mdash;"Having thrown away my Swiss uniform," replied he, "in the general
confusion, I fortunately possessed myself of the coat of a national volunteer,
which he had taken off on account of the hot weather. This garment, bespattered
with blood, I instantly put on, as well as his hat with a tri-coloured
cockade."&mdash;"This disguise saved your life," interrupted I.&mdash;"Yes,
indeed;" rejoined he. "Having got down to the vestibule, I could not find a
passage into the garden; and, to prevent suspicion, I at once mixed with the
mob on the place where we are now standing."&mdash;"How did you get off at
last," said I?&mdash;"I was obliged," answered he, "to shout and swear with the
<i>poissardes</i>, while the heads of many of my comrades were thrown out of
the windows."&mdash;"The <i>poissardes</i>," added I, "set no bounds to their
cruelty?"&mdash;"No," replied he, "I expected every moment to feel its effects;
my disguise alone favoured my escape: on the dead bodies of my countrymen they
practised every species of mutilation." Here Jean drew a picture of a nature
too horrid to be committed to paper. My pen could not trace it.----In a word,
nothing could exceed the ferocity of the infuriate populace; and the sacking of
the palace of the Trojan king presents but a faint image of what passed here on
the day which overset the throne of the Bourbons.</p>
<p>According to a calculation, founded as well on the reports of the police as
on the returns of the military corps, it appears that the number of men killed
in the attack of the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i> on the 10th of August 1792,
amounted in the whole to very near six thousand, of whom eight hundred and
fifty-two were on the side of the besieged, and three thousand seven hundred
and forty on the side of the besiegers.</p>
<p>The interior of this palace is not distinguished by any particular style of
architecture, the kings who have resided here having made such frequent
alterations, that the distribution throughout is very different from that which
was at first intended. Here it was that Catherine de Medicis shut herself up
with the Guises, the Gondis, and Birague, the chancellor, in order to plan the
horrible massacre of that portion of the French nation whose religious tenets
trenched on papal power, and whose spirit of independence alarmed regal
jealousy.</p>
<p>Among the series of entertainments, given on the marriage of the king of
Navarre with Marguerite de Valois, was introduced a ballet, in which the
papists, commanded by Charles IX and his brothers, defended paradise against
the huguenots, who, with Navarre at their head, were all repulsed and driven
into hell. Although this pantomime, solely invented by Catherine, was evidently
meant as a prelude to the dreadful proscription which awaited the protestants,
they had no suspicion of it; and four days after, was consummated the massacre,
where that monster to whom nature had given the form of a woman, feasted her
eyes on the mangled corpses of thousands of bleeding victims!</p>
<p>No sooner was the Pope informed of the horrors of St. Bartholemew's day; by
the receipt of Admiral de Coligny's head which Catherine embalmed and sent to
him, than he ordered a solemn procession, by way of returning thanks to heaven
for the <i>happy event</i>. The account of this procession so exasperated a
gentlemen of Anjou, a protestant of the name of Bressaut de la Rouvraye, that
he swore he would make eunuchs of all the monks who should fall into his hands;
and he rendered himself famous by keeping his word, and wearing the trophies of
his victory.</p>
<p>The <i>Louvre</i> and the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i> were alternately
the residence of the kings of France, till Lewis XIV built that of Versailles,
after which it was deserted till the minority of Lewis XV, who, when a little
boy, was visited here by Peter the Great, but, in 1722, the court quitted Paris
altogether for Versailles, where it continued fixed till the 5th of October
1789.</p>
<p>During this long interval, the palace was left under the direction of a
governor, and inhabited only by himself, and persons of various ranks dependent
on the bounty of the crown. When Lewis XVI and his family were brought hither
at that period, the two wings alone were in proper order; the remainder
consisted of spacious apartments appointed for the king's reception when he
came occasionally to Paris, and ornamented with stately, old-fashioned
furniture, which had not been deranged for years. The first night of their
arrival, they slept in temporary beds, and on the king being solicited the next
day to choose his apartments, he replied: "Let everyone shift for himself; for
my part, I am very well where I am." But this fit of ill-humor being over, the
king and queen visited every part of the palace, assigning particular rooms to
each person of their suite, and giving directions for sundry repairs and
alterations.</p>
<p>Versailles was unfurnished, and the vast quantity of furniture collected in
that palace, during three successive reigns, was transported to the
<i>Tuileries</i> for their majesties' accommodation. The king chose for himself
three rooms on the ground-floor, on the side of the gallery to the right as you
enter the vestibule from the garden; on the entresol, he established his
geographical study; and on the first floor, his bed-chamber: the apartments of
the queen and royal family were adjoining to those of the king; and the
attendants were distributed over the palace to the number of between six and
seven hundred persons.</p>
<p>The greater part of the furniture, &amp;c. in the palace of the
<i>Tuileries</i> was sold in the spring of 1793. The sale lasted six months,
and, had it not been stopped, would have continued six months longer. Some of
the king's dress-suits which had cost twelve hundred louis fetched no more than
five. By the inventory taken immediately after the 10th of August 1792, and
laid before the Legislative Assembly, it appears that the moveables of every
description contained in this palace were valued at 12,540,158 livres
(<i>circa</i> £522,560 sterling,) in which was included the amount of the
thefts, committed on that day, estimated at 1,000,000 livres, and that of the
dilapidations, at the like sum, making together about £84,000 sterling.</p>
<p>When Catherine de Medicis inhabited the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, it
was connected to the <i>Louvre</i> by a garden, in the middle of which was a
large pond, always well stocked with fish for the supply of the royal table.
Lewis XIV transformed this garden into a spacious square or <i>place</i>, where
in the year 1662, he gave to the queen dowager and his royal consort a
magnificent fête, at which, were assembled princes, lords, and knights, with
their ladies, from every part of Europe. Hence the square was named</p>
<p class="center">PLACE DU CARROUSEL.</p>
<p>Previously to the revolution, the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, on this
side, was defended by a wall, pierced by three gates opening into as many
courts, separated by little buildings, which, in part, served for lodging a few
troops and their horses. All these buildings are taken down; the <i>Place du
Carrousel</i> is considerably enlarged by the demolition of various
circumjacent edifices; and the wall is replaced by a handsome iron railing,
fixed on a parapet about four feet high. In this railing are three gates, the
centre one of which is surmounted by cocks, holding in their beak a civic crown
over the letters R. F. the initials of the words <i>République Française</i>.
On each side of it are small lodges, built of stone; and at the entrance are
constantly posted two <i>vedettes</i>, belonging to the horse-grenadiers of the
consular guard.</p>
<p>On the piers of the other two gates are placed the four famous horses of
gilt bronze, brought from St. Mark's place at Venice, whither they had been
carried after the capture of Byzantium. These productions are generally
ascribed to the celebrated Lysippus, who flourished in the reign of Alexander
the Great, about 325 years before the christian era; though this opinion is
questioned by some distguished antiquaries and artists. Whoever may be the
sculptor, their destiny is of a nature to fix attention, as their removal has
always been the consequence of a political revolution. After, the conquest of
Greece by the Romans, they were transported from Corinth to Rome, for the
purpose of adorning the triumphal arch of Septimius Severus. Hence they were
removed to Byzantium, when that city became the seat of the eastern empire.
From Byzantium, they were conveyed to Venice, and from Venice they have at last
reached Paris.</p>
<p>As on the plain of Pharsalia the fate of Rome was decided by Cæsar's triumph
over Pompey, so on the <i>Place du Carrousel</i> the fate of France by the
triumph of the Convention over Robespierre and his satellites. Here, Henriot,
one of his most devoted creatures, whom he had raised to the situation of
commandant general of the Parisian guard, after having been carried prisoner
before the Committee of Public Safety, then sitting in the palace of the
<i>Tuileries</i>, was released by Coffinhal, the President of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, who suddenly made his appearance at the head of a large body of horse
and foot, supported by four pieces of cannon served by gunners the most devoted
to Robespierre.</p>
<p>It was half past seven o'clock in the evening, where Coffinhal, decorated
with his municipal scarf, presented himself before the Committee: all the
members thought themselves lost, and their fright communicating to the very
bosom of the Convention, there spread confusion and terror. But Coffinhal's
presence of mind was not equal to his courage: he availed himself only in part
of his advantage. After having, without the slightest resistance, disarmed the
guards attached to the Convention, he loosened the fettered hands of Henriot
and his aides-de-camp, and conducted them straight to the <i>Maison
Commune</i>.</p>
<p>It is an incontestable fact that had either Coffinhal or Henriot imitated
the conduct of Cromwell in regard to the Levellers, and marched at the head of
their troops into the hall of the Convention, he might have carried all before
him, and Robespierre's tyranny would have been henceforth established on a
basis not to be shaken.</p>
<p>But, when Henriot soon after appeared on the <i>Place du Carrousel</i>, with
his staff and a number of followers, he in vain endeavoured by haranguing the
people to stir them up to act against the Convention; his voice was drowned in
tumultuous clamours, and he was deserted by his hitherto-faithful gunners. The
Convention had had time to recover from their panic, and to enlighten the
Sections. Henriot was outlawed by that assembly, and, totally disconcerted by
this news, he fled for refuge to the <i>Maison Commune</i>, where Robespierre
and all his accomplices were soon surrounded, and fell into the hands of those
whom but an instant before, they had proscribed as conspirators deserving of
the most exemplary punishment.</p>
<p>Henriot, confused and terrified, sought his safety in flight, and was
stealing along one of the galleries of the <i>Maison Commune</i> when he met
Coffinhal, who was also flying. At the sight of Henriot, who on coming from the
Committee, had pledged his life on the success of his measures, Coffinhal was
unable to check his rage. "Coward!" said he to him, "to this then has led your
certain means of defence! Scoundrel! you shall not escape the death you are
endeavouring to avoid!" Saying these words, he seized Henriot by the middle,
and threw him out of a window of the second story of the <i>Maison Commune</i>.
Henriot falling on the roof of a building in a narrow street adjoining, was not
killed; but he had scarcely recovered himself before he was recognized by some
soldiers in quest of him: he then crawled into a sewer, close to the spot where
he had fallen; when a soldier thrusting his bayonet into the sewer, put out one
of his eyes, and forced him to surrender.</p>
<p>Thus, the destiny of France, as is seen, hung by the thread of the moment.
It will be recollected that Henriot had the arsenal at his disposal; he
commanded the Parisian guard, and six thousand men encamped on the <i>Plaine
des Sablons</i>, close to the capital: in a word, all the springs of the public
force were in his hands. Had he seized the critical minute, and attacked the
Convention at the instant of his release, the scene of the 10th of August would
have been renewed, and the <i>Place du Carrousel</i> again stained with the
blood of thousands.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let11">LETTER XI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 5, 1801.</i></p>
<p>I rise much later to-day than usual, in consequence of not having gone to
bed till near seven o'clock this morning. Happening to call yesterday on a
French lady of my acquaintance, I perceived some preparations which announced
that she expected company. She did not leave me long in suspense, but invited
me to her party for that evening.</p>
<p>This good lady, who is no longer in the flower of her age, was still in bed,
though it was four o'clock when I paid my visit. On expressing my fears that
she was indisposed, she assured me of the contrary, at the same time adding
that she seldom rose till five in the afternoon, on account of her being under
the necessity of keeping late hours. I was so struck by the expression, that I
did not hesitate to ask her what was the <i>necessity</i> which compelled her
to make a practice of turning day into night? She very courteously gave me a
complete solution of this enigma, of which the following is the substance.</p>
<p>"During the reign of terror," said she, "several of us <i>ci-devant
noblesse</i> lost our nearest relatives, and with them our property, which was
either confiscated, or put under sequestration, so that we were absolutely
threatened by famine. When the prisoners were massacred in September 1792, I
left nothing unattempted to save the life of my uncle and grandfather, who were
both in confinement in the <i>Abbaye</i>. All my efforts were unavailing. My
interference served only to exasperate their murderers and contributed, I fear,
to accelerate their death, which it was my misfortune to witness. Their inhuman
butchers, from whom I had patiently borne every species of insult, went so far
as to present to me, on the end of a pike, a human heart, which had the
appearance of having been broiled on the embers, assuring me that, as it was
the heart of my uncle, I might eat it with safety."&mdash;Here an ejaculation,
involuntarily escaping me, interrupted her for a moment.</p>
<p>"For my part," continued she, "I was so overwhelmed by a conflict of rage,
despair, and grief, that I scarcely retained the use of my senses. The excess
of my horror deprived me of utterance.&mdash;What little I was able to save
from the wreck of my fortune, not affording me sufficient means of subsistence,
I was, however reluctantly, at length compelled to adopt a plan of life, by
which I saw other women, in my forlorn situation, support a decent appearance.
I therefore hired suitable apartments, and twice in each decade, I receive
company. On one of these two nights I give a ball and supper, and on the other,
under the name of <i>société</i>, I have cards only.</p>
<p>"Having a numerous circle of female acquaintance," concluded she, "my balls
are generally well attended: those who are not fond of dancing, play at the
<i>bouillotte</i>; and the card-money defrays the expenses of the
entertainment, leaving me a handsome profit. In short, these six parties,
during the month, enable me to pay my rent, and produce me a tolerable
pittance."</p>
<p>This meloncholy recital affected me so much, that, on its being terminated,
I was unable to speak; but I have reason to think that a favourable
construction was put on my silence. A volume, of the size of a family bible,
would not be sufficient to display half the contrasts engendered by the
revolution. Many a <i>Marquise</i> has been obliged to turn sempstress, in
order to gain a livelihood; but my friend the <i>Comtesse</i> had much ready
wit, though no talents of that description. Having soothed her mind by venting
a few imprecations against the murderers of her departed relatives, she
informed me that her company began to assemble between the hours of eleven and
twelve, and begged that I would not fail to come to her</p>
<p class="center">PRIVATE BALL.</p>
<p>About twelve o'clock, I accordingly went thither, as I had promised, when I
found the rooms perfectly crowded. Among a number of very agreeable ladies,
several were to be distinguished for the elegance of their figure, though there
were no more than three remarkable for beauty. These terrestrial divinities
would not only have embarrassed the Grand Signior for a preference, but even
have distracted the choice of the Idalian shepherd himself. The dancing was
already begun to an excellent band of music, led by Citizen JULIEN, a mulatto,
esteemed the first player of country-dances in Paris. Of the dancers, some of
the women really astonished me by the ease and gracefulness of their movements:
steps, which are known to be the most difficult, seemed to cost them not the
smallest exertion. Famous as they have ever been for dancing, they seem now, in
Cibber's words, "to outdo their usual outdoings."</p>
<p>In former times, an extraordinary degree of curiosity was excited by any
female who excelled in this pleasing accomplishment. I remember to have read
that Don Juan of Austria, governor of the Low Countries, set out post from
Brussels, and came to Paris <i>incog.</i> on purpose to see Marguerite de
Valois dance at a dress-ball, this princess being reckoned, at that time, the
best dancer in Europe. What then would be the admiration of such an
<i>amateur</i>, could he now behold the perfection attained here by some of the
beauties of the present day?</p>
<p>The men, doubtless, determined to vie with the women, seemed to pride
themselves more on agility than grace, and, by attempting whatever required
extraordinary effort, reminded me of <i>figurans</i> on the stage, so much have
the Parisian youth adopted a truly theatrical style of dancing.</p>
<p>The French country-dances (or cotilions, as we term them in England) and
waltzes, which are as much in vogue here as in Germany, were regularly
interchanged. However, the Parisians, in my opinion, cannot come up to the
Germans in this, their native dance. I should have wished to have had Lavater
by my side, and heard his opinion of the characters of the different female
waltzers. It is a very curious and interesting spectacle to see one woman
assume a languishing air, another a vacant smile, a third an aspect of stoical
indifference; while a fourth seems lost in a voluptuous trance, a fifth
captivates by an amiable modesty, a sixth affects the cold insensibility of a
statue, and so on in ever-varying succession, though all turning to the
animating changes of the same lively waltz. In short I observed that, in this
species of dance, the eyes and feet of almost every woman appeared to be
constantly at variance.</p>
<p>Without assuming the part of a moralist, I cannot help thinking that Werter
was not altogether in the wrong when he swore, that, were it to cost him his
life, no woman on whom he had set his affections, should ever waltz with any
one but himself. I am not singular in this opinion; for I recollect to have met
with the same ideas in a book written by M. JACOBI, I think, a German
author.</p>
<p>Speaking of the waltz, "We either ought," says he, "not to boast so much of
the propriety of our manners, or else not suffer that our wives and daughters,
in a complete delirium, softly pressed in the arms of men, bosom to bosom,
should thus be hurried away by the sound of intoxicating music. In this
<i>whirligig</i> dance, every one seems to forget the rules of decorum; and
though an innocent, young creature, exposed in this manner, were to remain pure
and spotless, can she, without horror, reflect that she becomes, the sport of
the imagination of the licentious youths to whom she so abandons herself? It
were to be wished," adds he, "that our damsels (I mean those who preserve any
vestige of bashfulness), might, concealed in a private corner, hear sometimes
the conversation of those very men to whom they yield themselves with so little
reserve and caution."</p>
<p>To the best of my recollection, these are the sentiments of M. JACOBI,
expressed twelve or fourteen years ago; yet I do not find that the waltz is
discontinued, or even less practised, in Germany, than it was at the time when
his work first appeared. This dance, like every other French fashion, has now
found its way into England, and is introduced between the acts, by way of
interlude I presume, at some of our grand private balls and assemblies. But,
however I may be amused by the waltzing of the Parisian belles, I feel too much
regard for my fair country-women to wish to see them adopt a dance, which, by
throwing them off their guard, lays them completely open to the shafts of
ridicule and malice.</p>
<p>Leaving this point to be settled by the worthy part of our British matrons,
let us return to the Parisian ball, from which I have been led into a little
digression.</p>
<p>The dancing continued in this manner, that is, French country-dances and
waltzes alternately, till four o'clock, when soup was brought round to all the
company. This was dispatched <i>sans façon</i>, as fast as it could be
procured. It was a prelude to the cold supper, which was presently served in
another spacious apartment. No sooner were the folding-doors of an adjoining
room thrown open, than I observed that, large as it was, it could not possibly
afford accommodation to more than half of the number present. I therefore
remained in the back-ground, naturally supposing that places would first be
provided for all the women. Not so, my friend; several men seated themselves,
and, in the twinkling of an eye, deranged the economy of the whole table; while
the female bystanders were necessitated to seek seats at some temporary tables
placed in the ballroom. Here too were they in luck if they obtained a few
fragments from the grand board; for, such determined voracity was there
exhibited, that so many vultures or cormorants could not have been more
expeditious in clearing the dishes.</p>
<p>For instance, an enormous salmon, which would have done honour to the Tweed
or the Severn, graced the middle of the principal table. In less than five
minutes after the company were seated, I turned round, and missing the fish,
inquired whether it had proved tainted. No: but it is all devoured, was the
reply of a young man, who, pointing to the bone, offered me a pear and a piece
of bread, which he shrewdly observed was all that I might probably get to
recruit my strength at this entertainment. I took the hint, and, with the
addition of a glass of common wine, at once made my supper.</p>
<p>In half an hour, the tables being removed, the ball was resumed, and
apparently with renewed spirit. The card-room had never been deserted. <i>Mind
the main chance</i> is a wholesome maxim, which the good lady of the house
seemed not to have forgotten. Assisted by a sort of <i>croupier</i>, she did
the honours of the <i>bouillotte</i> with that admirable sang-froid which you
and I have often witnessed in some of our hostesses of fashion; and, had she
not communicated to me the secret, I should have been the last to suspect,
while she appeared so indifferent, that she, like those ladies, had so great an
interest in the card-party being continued till morning.</p>
<p>As an old acquaintance, she took an opportunity of saying to, me, with joy
in her eyes: "<i>Le jeu va bien</i>;" but, at the same time, expressed her
regret that the supper was such a scramble. While we were in conversation, I
inquired the name and character of the most striking women in the room, and
found that, though a few of them might be reckoned substantial in fortune, as
well as in reputation, the female part of the company was chiefly composed of
ladies who, like herself, had suffered by the revolution; several were divorced
from their husbands, but as incompatibility of temper was the general plea for
such a disunion, that alone could not operate as a blemish.</p>
<p>To judge of the political predilection of these belles from their exterior,
a stranger would, nine times out of ten, be led into a palpable error. He might
naturally conclude them to be attached to a republican system, since they have,
in general, adopted the Athenian form of attire as their model; though they
have not, in the smallest degree, adopted the simple manners of that people.
Their arms are bare almost to the very shoulder; their bosom is, in a great
measure, uncovered; their ankles are encircled by narrow ribbands in imitation
of the fastenings of sandals; and their hair, turned up close behind, is
confined on the crown of the head in a large knot, as we see it in the antique
busts of Grecian beauties.</p>
<p>The rest of their dress is more calculated to display, than to veil the
contours of their person. It was thus explained to me by my friend, the
<i>ci-devant Comtesse</i>, who at the same time assured  me that young French
women, clad in this airy manner, brave all the rigour of winter. "A simple
piece of linen, slightly laced before," said she, "while it leaves the waist
uncompressed, answers the purpose of a corset. If they put on a robe, which is
not open in front, they dispense with petticoats altogether; their cambric
<i>chemise</i> having the semblance of one, from its skirt being trimmed with
lace. When attired for a ball, those who dance, as you may observe, commonly
put on a tunic, and then a petticoat becomes a matter of necessity, rather than
of choice. Pockets being deemed an incumbrance, they wear none: what money they
carry, is contained in a little morocco leather purse; this is concealed in the
centre of the bosom, whose form, in our well-shaped women, being that of the
Medicean Venus, the receptacle occasionally serves for a little gold watch, or
some other trinket, which is suspended to the neck by a collar of hair,
decorated with various ornaments. When they dance, the fan is introduced within
the zone or girdle; and the handkerchief is kept in the pocket of some sedulous
swain, to whom the fair one has recourse when she has occasion for it. Some of
the elderly ladies, like myself," added she, "carry these appendages in a sort
of work-bag, denominated a <i>ridicule</i>. Not long since, this was the
universal fashion first adopted as a substitute for pockets; but, at present,
it is totally laid aside by the younger classes."</p>
<p>The men at this ball, were, for the most part, of the military class, thinly
interspersed with returned emigrants. Some of the generals and colonels were in
their hussar dress-uniform, which is not only exceedingly becoming to a
well-formed man, but also extremely splendid and costly. All the seams of the
jacket and pantaloons of the generals are covered with rich and tasteful
embroidery, as well as their sabre-tash, and those of the colonels with gold or
silver lace: a few even wore boots of red morocco leather.</p>
<p>Most of the Gallic youths, having served in the armies, either a few years
ago under the requisition, or more recently under the conscription, have
acquired a martial air, which is very discernible, in spite of their <i>habit
bourgeois</i>. The brown coat cannot disguise the soldier. I have met with
several young merchants of the first respectability in Paris, who had served,
some two, others four years in the ranks, and constantly refused every sort of
advancement. Not wishing to remain in the army, and relinquish the mercantile
profession in which they had been educated, they cheerfully passed through
their military servitude as privates, and, in that station, like true soldiers,
gallantly fought their country's battles.</p>
<p>The hour of six being arrived, I was assailed, on all sides, by applications
to set down this or that lady, as the morning was very rainy, and,
independently of the long rank of hackney-coaches, which had been drawn up at
the door, every vehicle that could be procured, had long been in requisition.
The mistress of the house had informed two of her particular female friends
that I had a carriage in waiting; and as I could accommodate only a certain
number at a time, after having consented to take those ladies home first; I
conceived myself at liberty, on my return, to select the rest of my convoy. To
relieve beauty in distress was one of the first laws of ancient chivalry; and
no knight ever accomplished that vow with greater ardour than I did on this
occasion.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="letr12">LETTER XII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 7, 1801.</i></p>
<p>My impatience is at length gratified. I have seen BONAPARTE. Yesterday, the
6th, as I mentioned in a former letter, was the day of the grand parade, which
now takes place on the fifteenth only of every month of the Republican
Calendar. The spot where this military spectacle is exhibited, is the
court-yard of the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, which, as I have before
observed, is enclosed by a low parapet wall, surmounted by a handsome iron
railing.</p>
<p>From the kind attention of friend, I had the option of being admitted into
the palace, or introduced into the hotel of Cn. MARET, the Secretary of State,
which adjoins to the palace, and standing at right angles with it, commands a
full view of the court where the troops are assembled. In the former place, I
was told, I should not, on account of the crowd, have an opportunity to see the
parade, unless I took my station at a window two or three hours before it
began; while from the latter, I should enjoy the sight without any annoyance or
interruption.</p>
<p>Considering that an interval of a month, by producing a material change in
the weather, might render the parade far less brilliant and attractive, and
also that such an offer might not occur a second time, I made no hesitation in
preferring Cn. MARET'S hotel.</p>
<p>Accompanied by my introducer, I repaired thither about half past eleven
o'clock, and certainly I had every reason to congratulate myself on my
election. I was ushered into a handsome room on the first-floor, where I found
the windows partly occupied by some lovely women. Having paid my devoirs to the
ladies, I entered into conversation with an officer of rank of my acquaintance,
who had introduced me to them; and from him I gathered the following
particulars respecting the</p>
<p class="center">GRAND MONTHLY PARADE.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of every month, the First Consul in person reviews all the
troops of the consular guard, as well as those quartered in Paris, as a
garrison, or those which may happen to be passing through this city.</p>
<p>The consular guard is composed of two battalions of foot-grenadiers, two
battalions of light infantry, a regiment of horse-grenadiers, a regiment of
mounted chasseurs or guides, and two companies of flying artillery. All this
force may comprise between six and seven thousand men; but it is in
contemplation to increase it by a squadron of Mamalûks, intermixed with Greeks
and Syrians, mounted on Arabian horses.</p>
<p>This guard exclusively does duty at the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, and
at <i>Malmaison</i>, BONAPARTE's country-seat: it also forms the military
escort of the Consuls. At present it is commanded by General LASNES; but,
according to rumour, another arrangement is on the point of being made. The
consular guard is soon to have no other chief than the First Consul, and under
him are to command, alternately, four generals; namely, one of infantry, one of
cavalry, one of artillery, and one of engineers; the selection is said to have
fallen on the following officers, BESSIÈRES, DAVOUST, SOULT, and SONGIS.</p>
<p>The garrison (as it is termed) of Paris is not constantly of the same
strength. At this moment it consists of three demi-brigades of the line, a
demi-brigade of light infantry, a regiment of dragoons, two demi-brigades of
veterans, the horse <i>gendarmerie</i>, and a new corps of choice
<i>gendarmerie</i>, comprising both horse and foot, and commanded by the
<i>Chef de brigade</i> SAVABY, aide-de-camp to the First Consul. This garrison
may amount to about 15,000 effective men.</p>
<p>The consular guard and all these different corps, equipped in their best
manner, repair to the parade, and, deducting the troops on duty, the number of
men assembled there may, in general be from twelve to fifteen thousand.</p>
<p>By a late regulation, no one, during the time of the parade, can remain
within the railing of the court, either on foot or horseback, except the field
and staff officers on duty; but persons enter the apartments of the
<i>Tuileries</i>, by means of tickets, which are distributed to a certain
number by the governor of the palace.</p>
<p>While my obliging friend was communicating to me the above information, the
troops continued marching into the court below, till it was so crowded that, at
first sight, it appeared impracticable for them to move, much less to
man&oelig;uvre. The morning was extremely fine; the sun shone in full
splendour, and the gold and silver lace and embroidery on the uniforms of the
officers and on the trappings of their chargers, together with their naked
sabres, glittered with uncommon lustre. The concourse of people without the
iron railing was immense: in short, every spot or building, even to the walls
and rafters of houses under demolition, whence a transient view of the parade
could be obtained, was thronged with spectators.</p>
<p>By twelve o'clock, all the troops were drawn up in excellent order, and, as
you may suppose, presented a grand <i>coup d'&oelig;il.</i> I never beheld a
finer set of men than the grenadiers of the consular guard; but owing, perhaps,
to my being accustomed to see our troops with short skirts, I thought that the
extreme length of their coats detracted from their military air. The horses
mostly of Norman breed, could not be compared to our English steeds, either for
make or figure; but, sorry and rough as is their general appearance, they are,
I am informed, capable of bearing much fatigue, and resisting such privations
as would soon render our more sleek cavalry unfit for service. That they are
active, and surefooted, I can vouch; for, in all their sudden wheelings and
evolutions in this confined space, not one of them stumbled. They formed,
indeed, a striking contrast to the beautiful white charger that was led about
in waiting for the Chief Consul.</p>
<p>The band of the consular guard, which is both numerous and select, continued
playing martial airs, till the colours having been brought down from the
palace, under the escort of an officer and a small detachment, the drums beat
<i>aux champs</i>, and the troops presented arms, when they were carried to
their respective stations. Shortly after, the impatient steed, just mentioned,
was conducted to the foot of the steps of the grand vestibule of the palace. I
kept my eye stedfastly fixed on that spot; and such was the agility displayed
by BONAPARTE in mounting his horse, that, to borrow the words of Shakspeare, he
seemed to</p>
<p class="bq">"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,<br />
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,<br />
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds<br />
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,<br />
And witch the world with noble horsemanship."</p>
<p>Off he went at a hand canter, preceded by his aides-de-camp, and attended,
on his right, by General LASNES and followed by other superior officers,
particularly the general commanding the garrison of Paris, and him at the head
of the district.</p>
<p>BONAPARTE was habited in the consular dress, scarlet velvet embroidered with
gold, and wore a plain cocked hat with the national cockade. As I purpose to
obtain a nearer view of him, by placing myself in the apartments of the palace
on the next parade day, I shall say nothing of his person till that opportunity
offers, but confine myself to the military show in question.</p>
<p>Having rid rapidly along the several lines of infantry and cavalry, and
saluted the colours as he passed, BONAPARTE (attended by all his retinue,
including a favourite Mamalûk whom he brought from Egypt), took a central
position, when the different corps successively filed off before him with most
extraordinary briskness; the corps composing the consular guard preceded those
of the garrison and all the others: on inquiry, however, I find, that this
order is not always observed.</p>
<p>It is no less extraordinary than true, that the news of the establishment of
this grand parade produced on the mind of the late emperor of Russia the first
impression in favour of the Chief Consul. No sooner did Paul I. hear of the
circumstance, than he exclaimed: "BONAPARTE is, however, a great man."</p>
<p>Although the day was so favourable, the parade was soon over, as there was
no distribution of arms of honour, such as muskets, pistols, swords,
battle-axes, &amp;c. which the First Consul presents with his own hand to those
officers and soldiers who have distinguished themselves by deeds of valour or
other meritorious service.</p>
<p>The whole ceremony did not occupy more than half an hour, when BONAPARTE
alighted at the place where he had taken horse, and returned to his
audience-room in the palace, for the purpose of holding his levee. I shall
embrace a future opportunity to speak of the interior etiquette observed on
this occasion in the apartments, and close this letter with an assurance that
you shall have an early account of the approaching <i>fête</i>.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let13">LETTER XIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 8, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Great preparations for the <i>fête</i> of to-morrow have, for several days,
employed considerable numbers of people: it therefore becomes necessary that I
should no longer delay to give you an idea of the principal scene of action.
For that purpose, we must direct our steps to the</p>
<p class="center">JARDIN DES TUILERIES.</p>
<p>This garden, which is the most magnificent in Paris, was laid out by the
celebrated LE NOTRE in the reign of Lewis XIV. <a name="let13fr1"></a>It covers
a space of three hundred and sixty toises[<a href="#let13f1">1</a>] long by one
hundred and sixty-eight broad. To the north and south, it is bordered,
throughout its length, by two terraces, one on each side, which, with admirable
art, conceal the irregularity of the ground, and join at the farther end in the
form of a horse-shoe. To the east, it is limited by the palace of the
<i>Tuileries</i>; and to the west, by the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>.</p>
<p>From the vestibule of the palace, the perspective produces a most striking
effect: the eye first wanders for a moment over the extensive parterre, which
is divided into compartments, planted with shrubs and flowers, and decorated
with basins, <i>jets-d'eau</i>, vases, and statues in marble and bronze; it
then penetrates through a venerable grove which forms a beautiful vista; and,
following the same line, it afterwards discovers a fine road, bordered with
trees, leading by a gentle ascent to <i>Pont de Neuilly</i>, through the
<i>Barrière de Chaillot</i>, where the prospect closes.</p>
<p>The portico of the palace has been recently decorated with several statues.
On each side of the principal door is a lion in marble.</p>
<p>The following is the order in which the copies of antique statues, lately
placed in this garden, are at present disposed.</p>
<p>On the terrace towards the river, are: 1. Venus <i>Anadyomene</i>. 2. An
Apollo of Belvedere. 3. The group of Laocoon. 4. Diana, called by antiquaries,
<i>Succincta</i>. 5. Hercules carrying Ajax.</p>
<p>In front of the palace: 1. A dying gladiator. 2. A fighting gladiator. 3.
The flayer of Marsyas. 4. VENUS, styled <i>à la coquille</i>, crouched and
issuing from the bath. N. B. All these figures are in bronze.</p>
<p>In the alley in front of the parterre, in coming from the terrace next the
river: 1. Flora Farnese. 2. Castor and Pollux. 3. Bacchus instructing young
Hercules. 4. Diana.</p>
<p>On the grass-plot, towards the <i>manège</i> or riding-house, Hippomenes and
Atalanta. At the further end is an Apollo, in front of the horse-shoe walk,
decorated with a sphynx at each extremity.</p>
<p>In the corresponding gras-plot towards the river, Apollo and Daphne; and at
the further end, a Venus <i>Callypyga</i>, or (according to the French term)
<i>aux belles fesses</i>.</p>
<p>In the compartment by the horse-chesnut trees, towards the riding-house, the
Centaur. On the opposite side, the Wrestlers. Farther on, though on the same
side, an Antinoüs.</p>
<p>In the niche, under the steps in the middle of the terrace towards the
river, a Cleopatra.</p>
<p>In the alley of orange-trees, near the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>,
Meleager; and on the terrace, next to the riding-house, Hercules Farnese.</p>
<p>In the niche to the right, in front of the octagonal basin, a Faun carrying
a kid. In the one to the left, Mercury Farnese.</p>
<p>Independently of these copies after the antique, the garden is decorated
with several other modern statues, by COYZEVOX, REGNAUDIN, COSTOU, LE GROS, LE
PAUTRE, &amp;c. which attest the degree of perfection that had been attained,
in the course of the last century, by French sculptors. For a historical
account of them, I refer you to a work, which I shall send you by the first
opportunity, written by the learned MILLIN.</p>
<p>Here, in summer, the wide-spreading foliage of the lofty horse-chesnut trees
afford a most agreeable shade; the air is cooled by the continual play of the
<i>jets-d'eau</i>; while upwards of two hundred orange-trees, which are then
set out, impregnate it with a delightful perfume. The garden is now kept in
much better order than it was under the monarchy. The flower-beds are carefully
cultivated; the walks are well gravelled, rolled, and occasionally watered; in
a word, proper attention is paid to the convenience of the public.</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding these attractions, as long as it was necessary for
every person entering this garden to exhibit to the sentinels the national
cockade, several fair royalists chose to relinquish its charming walks, shaded
by trees of a hundred years' growth, rather than comply with the republican
mandate. Those anti-revolutionary <i>élégantes</i> resorted to other
promenades; but, since the accession of the consular government, the wearing of
this doubtful emblem of patriotism has been dispensed with, and the garden of
the <i>Tuileries</i> is said to be now as much frequented in the fine season as
at any period of the old <i>régime</i>.</p>
<p>The most constant visiters are the <i>quidnuncs</i>, who, according to the
difference of the seasons, occupy alternately three walks; the <i>Terrasse des
Feuillans</i> in winter; that which is immediately underneath in spring; and
the centre or grand alley during the summer or autumn.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, this garden was not open to the populace, except on
the festival of St. Lewis, and the eve preceding, when there was always a
public concert, given under a temporary amphitheatre erected against the west
façade of the palace: at present no person whatever is refused admittance.</p>
<p>There are six entrances, at each of which sentinels are regularly mounted
from the grenadiers of the consular guard; and, independently of the grand
guard-room over the vestibule of the palace, there is one at the end of the
garden which opens on the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>, and another on the
<i>Terrasse des Feuillans</i>.</p>
<p>But what is infinitely more interesting, on this terrace, is a new and
elegant building, somewhat resembling a <i>casino</i>, which at once unites
every accommodation that can be wished for in a coffee-house, a tavern, or a
confectioner's. Here you may breakfast <i>à l'Anglaise</i> or <i>à la
fourchette</i>, that is in the most substantial manner, in the French fashion,
read the papers, dine, or sup sumptuously in any style you choose, or drink
coffee and liqueurs, or merely eat ices. While thus engaged, you enjoy a full
view of the company passing and repassing, and what adds beyond measure to the
beauty of the scene, is the presence of the ladies, who not unfrequently come
hither with their admirers to indulge in a <i>téte-à-téte</i>, or make larger
parties to dine or sup at these fashionable rendezvous of good cheer.</p>
<p>According to the scandalous chronicle, Véry, the master of the house, is
indebted to the charms of his wife for the occupation of this tasteful edifice,
which had been erected by the government on a spot of ground that was national
property, and, of course, at its disposal. Several candidates were desirous to
be tenants of a building at once so elegant and so centrical. Véry himself had
been unsuccessful, though he had offered a <i>pot de vin</i> (that is the
Parisian term for <i>good-will</i>) of five hundred louis, and six thousand
francs a year rent. His handsome wife even began to apprehend that her mission
would be attended with no better fortune. She presented herself, however, to
the then Minister of the Interior, who, unrelenting as he had hitherto been to
all the competitors, did not happen to be a Scipio. On the contrary, he is said
to have been so struck by the person of the fair supplicant, that he at once
declared his readiness to accede to her request, on condition that she would
favour him with her company to supper, and not forget to put her night-cap in
her pocket. <i>Relata refero</i>.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, I assure you that Madame Véry, without being a perfect
beauty, is what the French call a <i>beau corps de femme</i>, or, in plain
English, a very desirable woman, and such as few ministers of L'n.
B--------te's years would choose to dismiss unsatisfied. This is not the age of
continence, and I am persuaded that any man who sees and converses with the
amiable Madame Véry, if he do not envy the Minister the nocturnal sacrifice,
will, on contemplating the elegance of her arrangements, at least allow that
this spot of ground has not been disposed of to disadvantage.</p>
<p>Every step we take, in this quarter of Paris, calls to mind some remarkable
circumstance of the history of the revolution. As the classic reader, in
visiting <i>Troas</i>, would endeavour to trace the site of those interesting
scenes described in the sublime numbers of the prince of poets; so the calm
observer, in perambulating this garden, cannot but reflect on the great
political events of which it has been the theatre. In front of the west façade
of the palace, the unfortunate Lewis XVI, reviewed the Swiss, and some of the
national guards, very early in the morning of the 10th of August 1792. On the
right, close to the <i>Terrasse des Feuillans</i>, still stands the
<i>manège</i> or riding-house, where the National Assembly at that time held
their sittings, and whither the king, with his family, was conducted by
ROEDERER, the deputy. That building, after having since served for various
purposes, is at present shut up, and will, probably, be taken down, in
consequence of projected improvements in this quarter.</p>
<p>In the centre of the west end of the garden, was the famous <i>Pont
tournant</i>, by which, on the 11th of July 1789, the Prince de Lambesc entered
it at the head of his regiment of cavalry, and, by maltreating some peaceable
saunterers, gave the Parisians a specimen of what they were to expect from the
disposition of the court. This inconsiderate <i>galopade</i>, as the French
term it, was the first signal of the general insurrection.</p>
<p>The <i>Pont tournant</i> is destroyed, and the ditch filled up. Leaving the
garden of the <i>Tuileries</i> by this issue, we enter the</p>
<p class="center">PLACE DE LA CONCORDE.</p>
<p>This is the new name given to the <i>Place de Louis XV</i>. After the
abolition of royalty in France, it was called the <i>Place de la
Révolution</i>. When the reign of terror ceased, by the fall of Robespierre, it
obtained its present appellation, which forms a strong contrast to the number
of victims that have here been sacrificed to the demon of faction.</p>
<p>This square, which is seven hundred and eighty feet in length by six hundred
and thirty in breadth, was planned after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and
finished in 1763. It forms a parallelogram with its angles cut off, which are
surrounded by ditches, guarded by balustrades, breast high. To repair from the
<i>Tuileries</i> to the <i>Champs Elysées</i>, you cross it in a straight line
from east to west, and from north to south, to proceed from the <i>Rue de la
Concorde (ci-devant Rue Royale)</i> to the <i>Pont de la Concorde (ci-devant
Pont de Louis XVI.)</i></p>
<p>Near the intersection of these roads stood the equestrian statue in bronze
of Lewis XV, which caught the eye in a direct line with the centre of the grand
alley of the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>. It has since been replaced by a
statue of Liberty. This colossal figure was removed a few days ago, and, by all
accounts, will not be re-erected.</p>
<p>The north part of this square, the only one that is occupied by buildings,
presents, on each side of the <i>Rue de la Concorde</i>, two edifices, each two
hundred and forty-eight feet in front, decorated with insulated columns of the
Corinthian order, to the number of twelve, and terminated by two pavilions,
with six columns, crowned by a pediment. On the ground-floor of these edifices,
one of which, that next the <i>Tuileries</i>, was formerly the <i>Garde-Meuble
de la Couronne</i>, are arcades that form a gallery, in like manner as the
colonnade above, the cornice of which is surmounted by a balustrade. I have
been thus particular in describing this façade, in order to enable you to judge
of the charming effect which it must produce, when illuminated with thousands
of lamps on the occasion of the grand <i>fête</i> in honour of peace, which
takes place to-morrow.</p>
<p>It was in the right hand corner of this square, as you come out of the
garden of the <i>Tuileries</i> by the centre issue, that the terrible
guillotine was erected. From the window of a friend's room, where I am now
writing, I behold the very spot which has so often been drenched with the mixed
blood of princes, poets, legislators, philosophers, and plebeians. On that spot
too fell the head of one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe.</p>
<p>I have heard much regret expressed respecting this execution; I have
witnessed much lamentation excited by it both in England and France; but I
question whether any of those loyal subjects, who deserted their king when they
saw him in danger, will ever manifest the sincere affection, the poignant
sensibility of DOMINIQUE SARRÈDE.</p>
<p>To follow Henry IV to the battle of Ivry in 1533, SARRÈDE had his wounded
leg cut off, in order that he might be enabled to sit on horseback. This was
not all. His attachment to his royal master was so great, that, in passing
through the <i>Rue de la Ferronnerie</i> two days after the  assassination of
that prince, and surveying the fatal place where it had been committed, he was
so overcome by grief, that he fell almost dead on the spot, and actually
expired the next morning. I question, I say, whether any one of those
emigrants, who made so officious a display of their zeal, when they knew it to
be unavailing, will ever moisten with a single tear the small space of earth
stained with the blood of their unfortunate monarch.</p>
<p>Since I have been in Paris, I have met with a person of great
respectability, totally unconnected with politics, who was present at several
of those executions: at first he attended them from curiosity, which soon
degenerated into habit, and at last became an occupation. He successively
beheld the death of Charlotte Corday, Madame Roland, Louis XVI, Marie
Antoinette, Madame Elizabeth, Philippe Egalité, Madame du Barry, Danton,
Robespierre, Couthon, St. Just, Henriot, Fouquier-Tinville, <i>cum mullis
aliis</i>, too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Among other particulars, this person informed me that Lewis XVI struggled
much, by which the fatal instrument cut through the back of his head, and
severed his jaw: the queen was more resigned; on the scaffold, she even
apologized to Samson, the executioner in chief, for treading accidentally on
his toe. Madame Roland met her fate with the calm heroism of a Roman matron.
Charlotte Corday died with a serene and dignified countenance; one of the
executioners having seized her head when it fell, and given it several slaps,
this base act of cowardice raised a general murmur among the people.</p>
<p>As to Robespierre, no sooner had he ascended the scaffold, amid the
vociferous acclamations of the joyful multitude, than the executioner tore off
the dirty bandage in which his wounded head was enveloped and which partlv
concealed his pale and ferocious visage. This made the wretch roar like a wild
beast. His under jaw then falling from the upper, and streams of blood gushing
from the wound, gave him the most ghastly appearance that can be imagined. When
the national razor, as the guillotine was called by his partisans, severed
Robespierre's head from his body; and the executioner, taking it by the hair,
held it up to the view of the spectators, the plaudits lasted for twenty
minutes. Couthon, St. Just, and Henriot, his heralds of murder, who were placed
in the same cart with himself, next paid the debt of their crimes. They were
much disfigured, and the last had lost an eye. Twenty-two persons were
guillotined at the same time with Robespierre, all of them his satellites. The
next day, seventy members of the commune, and the day following twelve others,
shared the fate of their atrocious leader, who, not many hours before, was
styled the virtuous and incorruptible patriot.</p>
<p>You may, probably, imagine that, whatever dispatch might be employed, the
execution of seventy persons, would demand a rather considerable portion of
time, an hour and a half, or two hours, for instance. But, how wide of the
mark! Samson, the executioner of Paris, worked the guillotine with such
astonishing quickness, that, including the preparatives of the punishment, he
has been known to cut off no less than forty-five heads, the one after the
other, in the short space of fifteen minutes; consequently, at this expeditious
rate of three heads in one minute it required no more than twenty-three minutes
and twenty seconds to decapitate seventy persons.</p>
<p>Guillotin, the physician, who invented or rather improved this machine,
which is called after his name with a feminine termination, is said to have
been a man of humanity; and, on that principle alone, he recommended the use of
it, from the idea of saving from painful sensations criminals condemned to die.
Seeing the abuse made of it, from the facility which it afforded of dispatching
several persons in a few minutes, he took the circumstance so much to heart
that grief speedily shortened his existence.</p>
<p>According to Robespierre, however, the axe of the guillotine did not do
sufficient execution. One of his satellites announced to him the invention of
an instrument which struck off nine heads at once: the discovery pleased him,
and he caused several trials of this new machine to be made at <i>Bicêtre</i>.
It did not answer; but human nature gained nothing by its failure. Instead of
half a dozen victims a day, Robespierre wished to have daily fifty or sixty, or
more; and he was but too well obeyed. Not only had he his own private lists of
proscription; but all his creatures, from the president of the revolutionary
tribunal down to the under-jailers, had similar lists; and the <i>almanac
royal</i>, or French court calendar, was converted into one by himself.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the streets through which the unfortunate sufferers were
carried, wearied at length by the daily sight of so melancholy a spectacle,
ventured to utter complaints. Robespierre, no less suspicious than cruel, was
alarmed, and, dreading an insurrection, removed the scene of slaughter. The
scaffold was erected on the <i>Place de la Bastille</i>: but the inhabitants of
this quarter also murmured, and the guillotine was transferred to the
<i>Barrière St. Antoine</i>.</p>
<p>Had not this modern Nero been cut off in the midst of his cruelties, it is
impossible to say where he would have stopped. Being one day asked the
question, he coolly answered: "The generation which has witnessed the old
<i>règime</i>, will always regret it. Every individual who was more than
fifteen in 1789, must be put to death: this is the only way to consolidate the
revolution."</p>
<p>It was the same in the departments as in Paris. Every where blood ran in
streams. In all the principal towns the guillotine was rendered permanent, in
order, as Robespierre expressed himself, to <i>regenerate the nation</i>. If
this sanguinary monster did not intend to "wade through slaughter to a throne,"
it is certain at least that he "shut the gates of mercy on mankind."</p>
<p>But what cannot fail to excite your astonishment and that of every thinking
person, is, that, in the midst of these executions, in the midst of these
convulsions of the state, in the midst of these struggles for power, in the
midst of these outcries against the despots of the day, in the midst of famine
even, not artificial, but real; in short, in the midst of an accumulation of
horrors almost unexampled, the fiddle and tambourin never ceased. Galas,
concerts, and balls were given daily in incredible numbers; and no less than
from fifteen to twenty theatres, besides several, other places of public
entertainment, were constantly open, and almost as constantly filled.</p>
<p>P. S. I am this moment informed of the arrival of Lord Cornwallis.</p>

<h2><a name="let14">LETTER XIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 10, 1801.</i></p>
<p>On the evening of the 8th, there was a representation <i>gratis</i> at all
the theatres, it being the eve of the great day, of the occurrences of which I
shall now, agreeably to my promise, endeavour to give you a narrative. I mean
the</p>
<p class="bq">NATIONAL FÉTE,<br />
IN HONOUR OF PEACE,<br />
<i>Celebrated on the 18th of Brumaire, year X,<br />
the anniversary of</i> BONAPARTE'S<br />
<i>accession to the consulate</i>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the prayers which the Parisians had addressed to the sun for
the preceding twenty-four hours,</p>
<p class="bq">"----<i>Nocte pluit totà, redeunt spectacula mane</i>,"</p>
<p>it rained all night, and was still raining yesterday morning, when the day
was ushered in by discharges of artillery from the saluting battery at the
<i>Hôtel des Invalides</i>. This did not disturb me; I slept soundly till,
about eight o'clock, a tintamarre of trumpets, kettle-drums, &amp;c. almost
directly under my window, roused me from my peaceful slumber. For fear of
losing the sight, I immediately presented myself at the casement, just as I
rose, in my shirt and night-cap. The officers of the police, headed by the
Prefect, and escorted by a party of dragoons, came to the <i>Place des
Victoires</i>, as the third station, to give publicity, by word of mouth, to
the Proclamation of the Consuls, of which I inclose you a printed copy. The
civil officers were habited in their dresses of parade, and decorated with
tricoloured sashes; the heads of their steeds, which, by the bye, were not of a
fiery, mettlesome race, being adorned in like manner.</p>
<p>This ceremony being over, I returned not to bed, but sat down to a
substantial breakfast, which I considered necessary for preparing my strength
for the great fatigues of so busy a day. Presently the streets were crowded
with people moving towards the river-side, though small, but heavy rain
continued falling all the forenoon. I therefore remained at home, knowing that
there was nothing yet to be seen for which it was worth while to expose myself
to a good wetting.</p>
<p>At two o'clock the sun appeared, as if to satisfy the eager desire of the
Parisians; the mist ceased, and the weather assumed a promising aspect. In a
moment the crowd in the streets was augmented by a number of persons who had
till now kept within doors, in readiness to go out, like the Jews keeping
Easter, <i>cincti renibus &amp; comedentes festinantur</i>. I also sallied
forth, but alone, having previously refused every invitation from my friends
and acquaintance to place myself at any window, or join any party, conceiving
that the best mode to follow the bent of my humour was to go unaccompanied,
and, not confining myself to any particular spot or person, stroll about
wherever the most interesting objects presented themselves.</p>
<p>With this view, I directed my steps towards the <i>Tuileries</i>, which, in
spite of the immense crowd, I reached without the smallest inconvenience. The
appearance of carriages of every kind had been strictly prohibited, with the
exception of those belonging to the British ambassador; a compliment well
intended, no doubt, and very gratifying when the streets were so extremely
dirty.</p>
<p>For some time I amused myself with surveying the different countenances of
the groups within immediate reach of my observation, and which to me was by no
means the least diverting part of the scene; but on few of them could I
discover any other impression than that of curiosity: I then took my station in
the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>, on the terrace next the river. Hence was a
view of the <i>Temple of Commerce</i> rising above the water, on that part of
the Seine comprised between the <i>Pont National</i> and the <i>Pont Neuf</i>.
The quays on each side were full of people; and the windows, as well as the
roofs of all the neighbouring houses, were crowded beyond conception. In the
newspapers, the sum of 500 francs, or £20 sterling, was asked for the hire of a
single window of a house in that quarter.</p>
<p>Previously to my arrival, a flotilla of boats, decked with streamers and
flags of different colours, had ascended the river from <i>Chaillot</i> to this
temple, and were executing divers evolutions around it, for the entertainment
of the Parisians, who quite drowned the music by their more noisy
acclamations.</p>
<p>About half after three, the First Consul appeared at one of the windows of
the apartments of the Third Consul, LEBRUN, which, being situated in the
<i>Pavillon de Flore</i>, as it is called, at the south end of the palace of
the <i>Tuileries</i>, command a complete view of the river. He and LEBRUN were
both dressed in their consular uniform.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, a balloon, previously prepared at this floating <i>Temple
of Commerce</i>, and adorned with the flags of different nations, ascended
thence with majestic slowness, and presently took an almost horizontal
direction to the south-west. In the car attached to it were Garnerin, the
celebrated aëronaut, his wife, and two other persons, who kept waving their
tricoloured flags, but were soon under the necessity of putting them away for a
moment, and getting rid of some of their ballast, in order to clear the
steeples and other lofty objects which appeared to lie in their route. The
balloon, thus lightened, rose above the grosser part of the atmosphere, but
with such little velocity as to afford the most gratifying spectacle to an
immense number of spectators.</p>
<p>While following it with my eyes, I began to draw comparisons in my mind, and
reflect on the rapid improvement made in these machines, since I had seen
Blanchard and his friend, Dr. Jefferies, leave Dover Cliff in January 1785.
They landed safely within a short distance of Calais, as every one knows: yet
few persons then conceived it possible, or at least probable, that balloons
could ever be applied to any useful purpose, still less to the art of war. We
find, however, that at the battle of Fleurus, where the Austrians were
defeated, Jourdan, the French General, was not a little indebted for his
victory to the intelligence given him of the enemy's dispositions by his
aëronautic reconnoitring-party.</p>
<p>The sagacious Franklin seems to have had a presentiment of the future
utility of this invention. On the first experiments being made of it,
some one asked him: "Of what use are balloons?"&mdash;"Of what use is a
new-born child!" was the philosopher's answer.</p>
<p>Garnerin and his fellow-travellers being now at such a distance as not to
interest an observer unprovided with a telespope, I thought it most prudent to
gratify that ever-returning desire, which, according to Dr. Johnson, excites
once a day a serious idea in the mind even of the most thoughtless. I
accordingly retired to my own apartments, where I had taken care that dinner
should be provided for myself and a friend, who, assenting to the propriety of
allowing every man the indulgence of his own caprice, had, like me, been taking
a stroll alone among the innumerable multitude of Paris.</p>
<p>After dinner, my friend and I sat chatting over our dessert, in order that
we might not arrive too soon at the scene of action. At six, however, we rose
from table, and separated. I immediately proceeded to the <i>Tuileries</i>,
which I entered by the centre gate of the <i>Place du Carrousel</i>. The whole
facade of the palace, from the base of the lowest pillars up to the very
turrets of the pavilions, comprising the entablatures, &amp;c. was decorated
with thousands of <i>lampions</i>, whence issued a steady, glaring light. By
way of parenthesis, I must inform you that these <i>lampions</i> are nothing
more than little circular earthen pans, somewhat resembling those which are
used in England as receptacles for small flower-pots. They are not filled with
oil, but with a substance prepared from the offals of oxen and in which a thick
wick is previously placed. Although the body of light proceeding from
<i>lampions</i> of this description braves the weather, yet the smoke which
they produce, is no inconsiderable drawback on the effect of their
splendour.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the brilliancy of the <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> from the
vestibule of the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>. The grand alley, as well as
the end of the parterre on each side and the edges of the basins, was
illuminated in a style equally tasteful and splendid. The frame-work on which
the lamps were disposed by millions, represented lofty arcades of elegant
proportion, with their several pillars, cornices, and other suitable ornaments.
The eye, astonished, though not dazzled, penetrated through the garden, and,
directed by this avenue of light, embraced a view of the temporary obelisk
erected on the ridge of the gradual ascent, where stands the <i>Barrière de
Chaillot</i>; the road on each side of the <i>Champs Elysées</i> presenting an
illuminated perspective, whose vanishing point was the obelisk
before-mentioned.</p>
<p>After loitering a short time to contemplate the west façade of the palace,
which, excelling that of the east in the richness of its architecture, also
excelled it in the splendour of its illuminations, I advanced along the centre
or grand alley to the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>. Here, rose three
<i>Temples</i> of correct design and beautiful symmetry, the most spacious of
which, placed in the centre, was dedicated to <i>Peace</i>, that on the right
hand to the <i>Arts</i>, and that on the left to <i>Industry</i>.</p>
<p>In front of these temples, was erected an extensive platform, about five
feet above the level of the ground, on which was exhibited a pantomime,
representing, as I was informed, the horrors of war succeeded by the blessings
of peace. Though I arrived in time to have seen at least a part of it, I saw
nothing, except the back of the spectators immediately before me, and others,
mounted on chairs and benches, some of whom seemed to consider themselves
fortunate if they recovered their legs, when they came now and then to the
ground, by losing their equilibrium. These little accidents diverted me for the
moment; but a misadventure of a truly-comic nature afforded me more
entertainment than any pantomime I ever beheld, and amply consoled me for being
thus confined to the back-ground.</p>
<p>A lusty young Frenchman, who, from his head-dress <i>à la Titus</i>, I shall
distinguish by that name, escorting a lady whom, on account of her beautiful
hair, I shall style <i>Berenice</i>, stood on one of the hindmost benches. The
belle, habited in a tunic <i>à la Grecque</i>, with a species of sandals which
displayed the elegant form of her leg, was unfortunately not of a stature
sufficiently commanding to see over the heads of the other spectators. It was
to no purpose that the gentleman called out "<i>à bas les chapeaux!</i>" When
the hats were off, the lady still saw no better. What will not gallantry
suggest to a man of fashionable education? Our considerate youth perceived, at
no great distance, some persons standing on a plank supported by a couple of
casks. Confiding the fair <i>Berenice</i> to my care, he vanished: but, almost
in an, instant, he reappeared, followed by two men, bearing an empty hogshead,
which, it seems, he procured from the tavern at the west entrance of the
<i>Tuileries</i>. To place the cask near the feet of the lady, pay for it, and
fix her on it, was the business of a moment. Here then she was, like a statue
on its pedestal, enjoying the double gratification of seeing and being seen.
But, for enjoyment to be complete, we must share it with those we love. On
examining the space where she stood, the lady saw there was room for two, and
accordingly invited the gentleman to place himself beside her. In vain he
resisted her entreaties; in vain he feared to incommode her. She commanded; he
could do no less than obey. Stepping up on the bench, he thence nimbly sprang
to the cask; but, O! fatal catastrophe! while, by the light of the neighbouring
clusters of lamps, every one around was admiring the mutual attention of this
sympathizing pair, in went the head of the hogshead.</p>
<p>Our till-then-envied couple fell suddenly up to the middle of the leg in the
wine-lees left in the cask, by which they were bespattered up to their very
eyes. Nor was this all: being too eager to extricate themselves, they overset
the cask, and came to the ground, rolling in it and its offensive contents. It
would be no easy matter to picture the ludicrous situation of Citizen
<i>Titus</i> and Madame <i>Berenice</i>. This being the only mischief resulting
from their fall, a universal burst of laughter seized the surrounding
spectators, in which I took so considerable a share, that I could not
immediately afford my assistance.</p>
<p /><p />
<h2><a name="let15">LETTER XV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 11, 1801.</i></p>
<p>What fortunate people are the Parisians! Yesterday evening so thick a fog
came on, all at once, that it was almost impossible to discern the lamps in the
streets, even when they were directly over-head. Had the fog occurred
twenty-four hours earlier, the effect of the illuminations would have been
entirely lost; and the blind would have had the advantage over the
clear-sighted. This assertion experience has proved: for, some years ago, when
there was, for several successive days, a duration of such fogs in Paris, it
was found necessary, by persons who had business to transact out of doors, to
hire the blind men belonging to the hospital of the <i>Quinze-Vingts</i>, to
lead them about the streets. These guides, who were well acquainted with the
topography of the capital, were paid by the hour, and sometimes, in the course
of the day, each of them cleared five louis.</p>
<p>Last night, persons in carriages, were compelled to alight, and grope their
way home as they could: in this manner, after first carefully ascertaining
where I was, and keeping quite close to the wall, I reached my lodgings in
safety, in spite of numberless interrogations put to me by people who had, or
pretended to have, lost themselves.</p>
<p>When I was interrupted in my account of the <i>fète</i>, we were, if I
mistake not, on the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the many loads of small gravel scattered here, with a view
of keeping the place clean, the quantity of mud collected in the space of a few
hours was really astonishing. <i>N'importe</i> was the word. No fine lady, by
whatever motive she was attracted hither, regretted at the moment being up to
her ankles in dirt, or having the skirt of her dress bemired. All was busy
curiosity, governed by peaceable order.</p>
<p>For my part, I never experienced the smallest uncomfortable squeeze, except,
indeed, at the conclusion of the pantomime, when the impatient crowd rushed
forward, and, regardless of the fixed bayonets of the guards in possession of
the platform, carried it by storm. Impelled by the torrent, I fortunately
happened to be nearly in front of the steps, and, in a few seconds, I found,
myself safely landed on the platform.</p>
<p>The guard now receiving a seasonable reinforcement, order was presently
restored without bloodshed; and, though several persons were under the
necessity of making a retrograde movement, on my declaring that I was an
Englishman, I was suffered to retain my elevated position, till the musicians
composing the orchestras, appropriated to each of the three temples, had taken
their stations. Admittance then became general, and the temples were presently
so crowded that the dancers had much difficulty to find room to perform the
figures.</p>
<p>Good-humour and decorum, however, prevailed to such a degree that, during
the number, of hours I mixed in the crowd, I witnessed not the smallest
disturbance.</p>
<p>Between nine and ten o'clock, I went to the <i>Pont de la Concorde</i> to
view the fireworks played off from the <i>Temple of Commerce</i> on the river;
but these were, as I understand, of a description far inferior to those
exhibited at the last National Fête of the 14th of July, the anniversary of the
taking of the Bastille.</p>
<p>This inferiority is attributed to the precaution dictated, by the higher
authorities, to the authors of the fireworks to limit their ingenuity; as, on
the former occasion, some accidents occurred of a rather serious nature. The
spectators, in general, appeared to me to be disappointed by the mediocrity of
the present exhibition.</p>
<p>I was compensated for the disappointment by the effect of the illumination
of the quays, which, being faced with stone, form a lofty rampart on each
embankment of the river. These were decorated with several tiers of lamps from
the top of the parapet to the water's edge; the parapets and cornices of the
bridges, together with the circumference of the arches, were likewise
illuminated, as well as the gallery of the <i>Louvre</i>, and the stately
buildings adjoining the quays.</p>
<p>The palace of the Legislative Body, which faces the south end of the <i>Pont
de la Concorde</i>, formed a striking object, being adorned, in a magnificent
style, with variegated lamps and transparencies. No less splendid, and in some
respects more so, from the extent that it presented, was the façade of the
<i>ci-devant Garde-Meuble</i>, and the corresponding buildings, which form the
north side of the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>, whither I now returned.</p>
<p>The effect of the latter was beautiful, as you may judge from the
description which I have already given you of this façade, in one of my
preceding letters. Let it suffice then to say, that, from the base of the lower
pillars to the upper cornice, it was covered with lamps so arranged as to
exhibit, in the most brilliant manner, the style and richness of its
architecture.</p>
<p>The crowd, having now been attracted in various directions, became more
penetrable; and, in regaining the platform on the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>,
I had a full view of the turrets, battlements, &amp;c. erected behind the three
temples, in which the skilful machinist had so combined his plan, by
introducing into it a sight of the famous horses brought from <i>Marly</i>, and
now occupying the entrance of the <i>Champs Elysées</i>, that these beautiful
marble representations of that noble animal seemed placed here on purpose to
embellish his scenery.</p>
<p>Finding myself chilled by standing so many hours exposed to the dampness of
a November night, I returned to the warmer atmosphere of the temples, in order
to take a farewell view of the dancers. The scene was truly picturesque, the
male part of the groups being chiefly composed of journeymen of various trades,
and the females consisting of a ludicrous medley of all classes; but it
required no extraordinary penetration to perceive, that, with the exception of
a few particular attachments, the military bore the bell, and, all things
considered, this was no more than justice. Independently of being the best
dancers, after gaining the laurels of victory in the hard-fought field, who can
deny that they deserved the prize of beauty?</p>
<p>The dancing was kept up with the never-flagging vivacity peculiar to this
nation, and, as I conclude, so continued till a very late hour in the morning.
At half past eleven I withdrew, with a friend whom I chanced to meet, to
Véry's, the famous <i>restaurateur's</i> in the <i>Tuileries</i>, where we
supped. On comparing notes, I found that I had been more fortunate than he, in
beholding to advantage all the sights of the day: though it was meant to be a
day of jubilee, yet it was far from being productive of that mirth or gaiety
which I expected. The excessive dearness of a few articles of the first
necessity may, probably, be one cause of this gloom among the people. Bread,
the staff of life, (as it may be justly termed in France, where a much greater
proportion is, in general, consumed than in any other country,) is now at the
enormous price of eighteen <i>sous</i> (nine-pence sterling) for the loaf of
four pounds. Besides, the Parisians have gone through so much during the
revolution, that I apprehend they are, to a certain degree, become callous to
the spontaneous sensations of joy and pleasure. Be the cause what it may, I am
positively assured that the people expressed not so much hilarity at this fête
as at the last, I mean that of the 14th of July.</p>
<p>In my way home, I remarked that few houses were illuminated, except those of
the rich in the streets which are great thorough-fares. People here, in
general, I suppose, consider themselves dispensed from lighting up their
private residence from the consideration that they collectively contribute to
the public illumination, the expenses of which are defrayed by the government
out of the national coffers.</p>
<p>Several songs have been composed and published in commemoration of this
joyful event. Among those that have fallen under my notice, I have selected the
following, of which our friend M---s, with his usual facility and taste, will,
I dare say, furnish you an imitation.</p>

<h2><a name="let16">LETTER XVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 13, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Enriched, as this capital now is, with the spoils of Greece and Italy, it
may literally be termed the repository of the greatest curiosities existing. In
the CENTRAL MUSEUM are collected all the prodigies of the fine arts, and, day
after day, you may enjoy the sight of these wonders.</p>
<p>I know not whether you are satisfied with the abridged account I gave you of
the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES; but, on the presumption that you did not expect from
me a description of every work of sculpture contained in it, I called your
attention to the most pre-eminent only; and I shall now pursue the same plan,
respecting the master-pieces of painting exhibited in the great</p>
<p class="center">GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE</p>
<p>This gallery, which is thirteen hundred and sixty-five feet in length by
thirty in breadth, runs north and south all along the quays of the river Seine,
and joins the <i>Louvre</i> to the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>. It was begun
by Charles IX, carried as far as the first wicket by Henry IV, to the second by
Lewis XIII, and terminated by Lewis XIV. One half, beginning from a narrow
strip of ground, called the <i>Jardin de l'Infante</i>, is decorated externally
with large pilasters of the Composite order, which run from top to bottom, and
with pediments alternately triangular and elliptical, the tympanums of which,
both on the side of the <i>Louvre</i>, and towards the river, are charged with
emblems of the Arts and Sciences. The other part is ornamented with coupled
pilasters, charged with vermiculated rustics, and other embellishments of
highly-finished workmanship.</p>
<p>In the inside of this gallery are disposed the <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> of
all the great masters of the Italian, Flemish, and French schools. The
pictures, particularly the historical ones, are hung according to the
chronological order of the painters' birth, in different compartments, the
number of which, at the present period, amounts to fifty-seven; and the
productions of each school and of each master are as much as possible
assembled; a method which affords the advantage of easily comparing one school
to another, one master to another, and a master to himself. If the chronology
of past ages be considered as a book from which instruction is to be imbibed,
the propriety of such a classification requires no eulogium. From the pictures
being arranged chronologically, the GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE becomes a sort of
dictionary, in which may be traced every degree of improvement or decline that
the art of painting has successively experienced.</p>
<p>The entrance to the great GALLERY OF PAINTINGS is precisely the same as that
to the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. After ascending a noble stone stair-case, and
turning to the left, you reach the</p>
<p class="center">SALOON OF THE LOUVRE.</p>
<p>This apartment, which serves as a sort of antichamber to the great Gallery,
is, at the present moment, appropriated to the annual monthly exhibition of the
productions of living painters, sculptors, architects, engravers, and
draughtsmen. Of these modern works, I shall, perhaps, speak on a future
occasion. But, in the course of a few days, they will give place to several
master-pieces of the Italian School, some of which were under indispensable
repair, when the others were arranged in the great Gallery.</p>
<p>It would be no easy task to express the various sentiments which take
possession of the mind of the lover of the arts, when, for the first time, he
enters this splendid repository. By frequent visits, however, the imagination
becomes somewhat less distracted, and the judgment, by degrees, begins to
collect itself. Although I am not, like you, conversant in the Fine Arts, would
you tax me with arrogance, were I to presume to pass an opinion on some of the
pictures comprised in this matchless collection?</p>
<p>Painting being a representation of nature, every spectator, according to the
justness of his ideas, may form an opinion how far the representation is
happily pourtrayed, and in beholding it, experience a proportionate degree of
pleasure: but how different the sensations of him who, combining all the
requisites of a connoisseur, contemplates the composition of a masterly genius!
In tracing the merits of such a production, his admiration gradually becomes
inflamed, as his eye strays from beauty to beauty.</p>
<p>In painting or sculpture, beauty, as you well know, is either natural, or
generally admitted: the latter depends on the perfection of the performance, on
certain rules established, and principles settled. This is what is termed
<i>ideal</i> beauty, which is frequently not within the reach of the vulgar;
and the merit of which may be lost on him who has not learned to know and
appreciate it. Thus, one of the finest pictures, ever conceived and executed by
man, might not, perhaps, make an impression on many spectators. Natural beauty,
on the contrary, is a true imitation of nature: its effect is striking and
general, so that it stands not in need of being pointed out, but is felt and
admired by all.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this truth, be assured that I should never, of my own
accord, have ventured to pronounce on the various degrees of merit of so many
<i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>, which all at once solicit attention. This would
require a depth of knowledge, a superiority of judgment, a nicety of
discrimination, a fund of taste, a maturity of experience, to none of which
have I any pretension. The greatest masters, who have excelled in a particular
branch, have sometimes given to the world indifferent productions; while
artists of moderate abilities have sometimes produced master-pieces far above
their general standard. In a picture, which may, on the whole, merit the
appellation of a <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, are sometimes to be found beauties
which render it superior, negligences which border on the indifferent, and
defects which constitute the bad. Genius has its flights and deviations;
talent, its successes, attempts, and faults; and mediocrity even, its flashes
and chances.</p>
<p>Whatever some persons may affect, a true knowledge of the art of painting is
by no means an easy acquirement; it is not a natural gift, but demands much
reading and study. Many there are, no doubt, who may be able to descant
speciously enough, perhaps, on the perfections and defects of a picture; but,
on that account alone, they are not to be regarded as real judges of its
intrinsic merit.</p>
<p>Know then, that, in selecting the most remarkable productions among the vast
number exhibited in the CENTRAL MUSEUM, I have had the good fortune to be
directed by the same first-rate connoisseur who was so obliging as to fix my
choice in the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. I mean M. VISCONTI.</p>
<p>Not confining myself either to alphabetical or chronological order, I shall
proceed to point out to you such pictures of each school as claim particular
notice.</p>
<h3>ITALIAN SCHOOL.</h3>
<p>N. B. <i>Those pictures to which no number is prefixed, are not yet publicly
exhibited</i>.</p>
<p class="center">RAFFAELLO.</p>

&amp;c.</i> commonly known by the name of the <i>Madonna di
Foligno</i>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is one of the master-pieces of RAPHAEL for vigour of colouring, and for
the beauty of the heads and of the child. It is in his second manner; although
his third is more perfect, seldom are the pictures of this last period entirely
executed by himself. This picture was originally painted on pannel, and was in
such a lamentable state of decay, that doubts arose whether it could safely be
conveyed from Italy. It has been recently transferred to canvass, and now
appears as fresh and as vivid, as if, instead of a lapse of three centuries,
three years only had passed since it was painted. Never was an operation of the
like nature performed in so masterly a manner. The process was attended by a
Committee of the National Institute, appointed at the particular request of the
Administration of the Museum. The <i>Madonna di Foligno</i> is to be engraved
from a drawing taken by that able draughtsman DU TERTRE.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td valign="top">N&deg;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</td><td><i>The Holy
Family</i>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This valuable picture of RAPHAEL'S third manner is one of the most perfect
that ever came from his pencil. It belonged to the old collection of the crown,
and is engraved by EDELINCK. Although superior to the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i>
as to style and composition, it is inferior in the representation of the child,
and in vigour of colouring.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td valign="top">N&deg;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</td><td><i>The
Transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor.</i></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is the last production of RAPHAEL, and his most admirable <i>chef
d'&oelig;uvre</i> as to composition and grace of the contours in all its
figures. It is not yet exhibited, but will be shortly. This picture is in
perfect preservation, and requires only to be cleaned from a coat of dust and
smoke which has been accumulating on it for three centuries, during which it
graced the great altar of St. Peter's church at Rome.</p>
<p>Among the portraits by RAPHAEL, the most surprising are:</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center" width="65%">
<tr><td valign="top">N&deg;&nbsp;58.</td><td>(Saloon.) <i>Baltazzare
Castiglione</i>, a celebrated writer in Italian and Latin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>N&deg;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</td><td><i>Leo X.</i></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Every thing that RAPHAEL'S pencil has produced is in the first order. That
master has something greatly superior in his manner: he really appears as a god
among painters. Addison seems to have been impressed with the truth of this
sentiment, when he thus expresses himself:</p>
<p class="bq">
"Fain would I RAPHAEL'S godlike art rehearse,<br />
And shew th' immortal labours in my verse,<br />
When from the mingled strength of shade and light,<br />
A new creation rises, to my sight:<br />
Such heav'nly figures from his pencil flow,<br />
So warm with life his blended colours glow,<br />
From theme to theme with secret pleasure lost,<br />
Amidst the soft variety I'm lost."
<p class="center">LEONARDO DA VINCI.</p>
<p>There are several pictures by this master in the present exhibition; but you
may look here in vain for the portrait of <i>La Gioconda</i>, which he employed
four years in painting, and in which he has imitated nature so closely, that,
as a well-known author has observed, "the eyes have all the lustre of life, the
hairs of the eye brows and lids seem real, and even the pores of the skin are
perceptible."</p>
<p>This celebrated picture is now removed to the palace of the
<i>Tuileries</i>; but the following one, which remains, is an admirable
performance.</p>

<i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of TITIAN. It was painted on pannel; but, having
undergone the same operation as the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i>, is now placed on
canvass, and is in such a state as to claim the admiration of succeeding
ages.</p>

<p>This picture, commonly distinguished by the appellation of the <i>St.

year 1749, the king of Portugal is said to have offered for it a sum equal in
value to £18,000 sterling.</p>

</table>
<p>This last-mentioned picture has just been engraved in an excellent manner by
an Italian artist, M. ROSA-SPINA.</p>
<p>The grace of his pencil and his <i>chiaro oscuro</i> place CORREGGIO in the
first class of painters, where he ranks the third after RAPHAEL and TITIAN. He
is inferior to them in design and composition; however the scarceness of his
pictures frequently gives them a superior value. Poor CORREGGIO! It grieves one
to recollect that he lost his life, in consequence of the fatigue of staggering
home under a load of <i>copper</i> coin, which avaricious monks had given him
for pictures now become so valuable that they are not to be purchased for their
weight, even in <i>gold</i>.</p>

<p>We have now noticed the best productions of the Italian School: in our next
visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM, I shall point out the most distinguished pictures
of the French and Flemish Schools.</p>
<p>P. S. Lord Cornwallis is sumptuously entertained here, all the ministers
giving him a grand dinner, each in rotation. After having viewed the
curiosities of Paris, he will, in about a fortnight, proceed to the congress at
Amiens. On his Lordship's arrival, I thought it my duty to leave my name at his
hotel, and was most agreeably surprised to meet with a very old acquaintance in
his military Secretary, Lieut. Col. L--------s. For any of the ambassador's
further proceedings, I refer you to the English newspapers, which seem to
anticipate all his movements.</p>
<h2><a name="let17">LETTER XVII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 15, 1801.</i></p>
<p>The more frequently I visit the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, the more am I
inclined to think that such a vast number of pictures, suspended together,
lessen each other's effect. This is the first idea which now presents itself to
me, whenever I enter the</p>
<p class="center">GALLERY OF THE LOUVRE.</p>
<p>Were this collection rendered apparently less numerous by being subdivided
into different apartments, the eye would certainly be less dazzled than it is,
at present, by an assemblage of so many various objects, which, though arranged
as judiciously as possible, somehow convey to the mind an image of confusion.
The consequence is that attention flags, and no single picture is seen to
advantage, because so many are seen together.</p>
<p>In proportion as the lover of the arts becomes more familiarized with the
choicest productions of the pencil, he perceives that there are few pictures,
if any, really faultless. In some, he finds beauties, which are general, or
forming, as it were, a whole, and producing a general effect; in others, he
meets with particular or detached beauties, whose effect is partial: assembled,
they constitute the beautiful: insulated, they have a merit which the amateur
appreciates, and the artist ought to study. General or congregated beauties
always arise from genius and talent: particular or detached beauties belong to
study, to labour, that is, to the <i>nulla die sine lineâ</i> and sometimes
solely to chance, as is exemplified in the old story of Protogenes, the
celebrated Rhodian painter.</p>
<p>To discover some of these beauties, requires no extraordinary discernment; a
person of common observation might decide whether the froth at the mouth of an
animal, panting for breath, was naturally represented: but a spectator,
possessing a cultivated and refined taste, minutely surveys every part of a
picture, examines the grandeur of the composition, the elevation of the ideas,
the nobleness of the expression, the truth and correctness of the design, the
grace scattered over the different objects, the imitation of nature in the
colouring, and the masterly strokes of the pencil.</p>
<p>Our last visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM terminated with the Italian School; let
us now continue our examination, beginning with the</p>
<h3>FRENCH SCHOOL.</h3>
<p class="center">LE BRUN.</p>

<p>The compositions of LE BRUN are grand and rich; his costume well-chosen, and
tolerably scientific; the tone of his pictures well-suited to the subject. But,
in this master, we must not look for purity and correctness of drawing, in an
eminent degree. He much resembles PIETRO DA CORTONA. LE BRUN, however, has a
taste more in the style of RAPHAEL and the antique, though it is a distant
imitation. The colouring of PIETRO DA CORTONA is far more agreeable and more
captivating.</p>
<p>Among the small pictures by LE BRUN, N&deg;s. 14 and 16 deserve to be
distinguished; but his <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> are the achievements of
Alexander. When the plates from these historical paintings, engraved by AUDRAN,
reached Rome, it is related that the Italians, astonished, exclaimed:
"<i>Povero Raffaello! non sei più il primo</i>." But, when they afterwards saw
the originals, they restored, to RAPHAEL his former pre-eminence.</p>

<p>POUSSIN is the greatest painter of the French school. His compositions bear
much resemblance to those of RAPHAEL, and to the antique: though they have not
the same <i>naïveté</i> and truth. His back-grounds are incomparable; his
landscapes, in point of composition, superior even to those of CLAUDE. His
large altar-pieces are the least beautiful of his productions. His feeble
colouring cannot support proportions of the natural size: in these pictures,
the charms of the background are also wanting.</p>

<p>The pictures, exhibited in the <i>Saloon</i> of the <i>Louvre</i>, have
infinitely the advantage of those in the <i>Great Gallery</i>; the former
apartment being lighted from the top; while in the latter, the light is
admitted through large windows, placed on both sides, those on the one side
facing the compartments between those on the other; so that, in this respect,
the master-pieces in the <i>Gallery</i> are viewed under very unfavourable
circumstances.</p>
<p><a name="let17fr1"></a>The <i>Gallery</i> of the <i>Louvre</i> is still
capable of containing more pictures, one eighth part of it (that next to the
<i>Tuileries</i>), being under repair for the
purpose.[<a href="#let17f1">1</a>] It has long been a question with the French
republican government, whether the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i> should not be
connected to the <i>Louvre</i>, by a gallery parallel to that which borders the
Seine. Six years ago, I understand, the subject was agitated, and dropped
again, on consideration of the state of the country in general, and
particularly the finances. It is now revived; and I was told the other day,
that a plan of construction had absolutely been adopted. This, no doubt, is
more easy than to find the sums of money necessary for carrying on so expensive
an undertaking.</p>
<p>If the fact were true, it is of a nature to produce a great sensation in
modern art, since it is affirmed that the object of this work is to give a vast
display to every article appropriated to general instruction; for, according to
report, it is intended that these united buildings, should, in addition to the
National Library, contain the collections of statues, pictures, &amp;c. &amp;c.
still remaining at the disposal of the government. I would not undertake to
vouch for the precise nature of the object proposed; but it cannot be denied
that, in this project, there is a boldness well calculated to flatter the
ambition of the Chief Consul.</p>
<p>However, I think it more probable that nothing, in this respect, will be
positively determined in the present state of affairs. The expedition to St.
Domingo will cost an immense sum, not to speak of the restoration of the French
navy, which must occasion great and immediate calls for money. Whence I
conclude that the erection of the new Gallery, like that of the National
Column, will be much talked of, but remain among other projects in embryo, and
the discussion be adjourned <i>sine die</i>.</p>
<p>Leaving the <i>Great Gallery</i>, we return to the <i>Saloon</i> of the
<i>Louvre</i>, which, being an intermediate apartment, serves as a point of
communication between it and the</p>
<p class="center">GALLERY OF APOLLO.</p>
<p>The old gallery of this name, first called <i>La petite galérie du
Louvre</i>, was constructed under the reign of Henry IV, and, from its origin,
ornamented with paintings. This gallery having been consumed by fire in 1661,
owing to the negligence of a workman employed in preparing a theatre for a
grand ballet, in which the king was to dance with all his court, Lewis XIV
immediately ordered it to be rebuilt and magnificently decorated.</p>
<p>LE BRUN, who then directed works of this description in France, furnished
the designs of all the paintings, sculpture, and ornaments, which are partly
executed. He divided the vault of the roof into eleven principal compartments;
in that which is in the centre, he intended to represent <i>Apollo</i> in his
car, with all the attributes peculiar to the Sun, which was the king's device.
The <i>Seasons</i> were to have occupied the four nearest compartments; in the
others, were to have been <i>Evening</i> and <i>Morning</i>, <i>Night</i> and
<i>Day-break</i>, the <i>Waking of the Waters</i>, and that of the <i>Earth at
Sun-rise</i>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for his fame, this vast project of LE BRUN was never
completed. Lewis XIV, captivated by Versailles, soon turned all his thoughts
towards the embellishment of that palace. The works of the GALLERY OF APOLLO
were entirely abandoned, and, of all this grand composition, LE BRUN was
enabled to execute no more than the following subjects:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><i>Evening</i>, represented by Morpheus, lying on a bed of poppies, and
buried in a profound sleep.</li>
<li><i>Night</i> succeeding to day, and lighted by the silvery disk of the
Moon, which, under the figure of Diana, appears in a car drawn by hinds.</li>
<li><i>The Waking of the Waters</i>. Neptune and Amphitrite on a car drawn by
sea-horses, and accompanied by Tritons, Nereïds, and other divinities of the
waters, seem to be paying homage to the rising sun, whose first rays dispel the
Winds and Tempests, figured by a group to the left; while, to the right,
Polyphemus, seated on a rock, is calling with his loud instrument to his
Galatea.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other compartments, which LE BRUN could not paint, on account of the
cessation of the works, remained a long time vacant, and would have been so at
this day, had not the <i>ci-devant</i> Academy of Painting, to whom the king,
in 1764, granted the use of the GALLERY OF APOLLO, resolved that, in future,
the historical painters who might be admitted members, should be bound to paint
for their reception one of the subjects which were still wanting for the
completion of the ceiling. In this manner, five of the compartments, which
remained to be filled, were successively decorated, namely:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><i>Summer</i>, by DURAMEAU.</li>
<li><i>Autumn</i>, by TARAVAL.</li>
<li><i>Spring</i>, by CALLET.</li>
<li><i>Winter</i>, by LAGRENÉE the younger,</li>
<li><i>Morning</i>, or day-break, by RENOU.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GALLERY OF APOLLO now making part of the CENTRAL MUSEUM, it would be
worthy of the government to cause its ceiling to be completed, by having the
three vacant compartments painted by skillful French artists.</p>
<p>Under the compartments, and immediately above the cornice, are twelve
medallions, which were to represent the <i>twelve months of the year</i>,
characterized by the different occupations peculiar to them: eight only are
executed, and these are the months of summer, autumn, and winter.</p>
<p>The rich borders in gilt stucco, which serve as frames to all these
paintings, the caryatides which support them, as well as the groups of Muses,
Rivers, and Children, that are distributed over the great cornice, are worthy
of remark. Not only were the most celebrated sculptors then in France, GASPAR
and BALTHAZAR MARSY, REGNAUDIN, and GIRARDON, chosen to execute them; but their
emulation was also excited by a premium of three hundred louis, which was
promised to him who should excel. GIRARDON obtained it by the execution of the
following pieces of sculpture:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The figure representing a river which is under the <i>Waking of the
Waters</i>; at the south extremity of the gallery.</li>
<li>The two trophies of arms which are near that river.</li>
<li>The caryatides that support one of the octagonal compartments towards the
quay, at the foot of which are seen two children; the one armed with a sickle,
the other leaning on a lion.</li>
<li>The group of caryatides that supports the great compartment where
<i>Summer</i> is represented, and below which is a child holding a
balance.</li>
<li>The two grouped figures of Tragedy and Comedy, which rest on the great
cornice.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the GALLERY OF APOLLO will be exhibited in succession, about twelve
thousand original drawings of the Italian, Flemish, and French schools, the
greater part of which formerly belonged to the crown. This valuable collection
had been successively enriched by the choice of those of JABAK, LANQUE,
MONTARSIS, LE BRUN, CROZAT, MARIETTE, &amp;c. yet never rendered public.
Private and partial admission to it had, indeed, been granted; but artists and
amateurs, in general, were precluded from so rich a source of study. By
inconceivable neglect, it seemed almost to have escaped the attention of the
old government, having been for a hundred years shut up in a confined place,
instead of being exhibited to public view.</p>
<p>The variety of the forms and dimensions of these drawings having opposed the
more preferable mode of arranging them by schools, and in chronological order,
the most capital drawings of each master have been selected (for, in so
extensive a collection, it could not be supposed that they were all equally
interesting); and these even are sufficiently numerous to furnish several
successive exhibitions.</p>
<p>The present exhibition consists of upwards of two hundred drawings by the
most distinguished masters of the Italian school, about one hundred by those of
the Flemish, and as many, or rather more, by those of the French. They are
placed in glazed frames, so contrived as to admit of the subjects being changed
at pleasure. Among the drawings by RAPHAEL, is the great cartoon of the
Athenian School, a valuable fragment which served for the execution of the
grand <i>fresco</i> painting in the Vatican, the largest and finest of all his
productions. It was brought from the Ambrosian library at Milan, and is one of
the most instructive works extant for a study.</p>
<p>Besides the drawings, is a frame containing a series of portraits of
illustrious personages who made a figure in the reign of Lewis XIV. They are
miniatures in enamel, painted chiefly by the celebrated PETITOT of Geneva.</p>
<p>Here are also to be seen some busts and antique vases. The most remarkable
of the latter is one of Parian marble, about twenty-one inches in height by
twelve in diameter. It is of an oval form; the handles, cut out of the solid
stone, are ornamented with four swans' heads, and the neck with branches of
ivy. On the swell is a bas-relief, sculptured in the old Greek style, and in
the centre is an altar on which these words may be decyphered.</p>

<p><a name="let17fr2"></a>This beautiful vase[<a href="#let17f2">2</a>] is
placed on a table of violet African breccia, remarkable for its size, being
twelve feet in length, three feet ten inches in breadth, and upwards of three
inches in thickness.</p>
<p>It might, at first, be supposed that the indiscriminate admission of persons
of all ranks to a Museum, which presents so many attractive objects, would
create confusion, and occasion breaches of decorum. But this is by no means the
case. <i>Savoyards</i>, <i>poissardes</i>, and the whole motley assemblage of
the lower classes of both sexes in Paris, behave themselves with as much
propriety as the more refined visiters; though their remarks, perhaps, may be
expressed in language less polished. In conspicuous places of the various
apartments, boards are affixed, on which is inscribed the following significant
appeal to the uncultivated mind, "<i>Citoyens, ne touchez à rien; mais
respectez la Propriété Nationale</i>." Proper persons are stationed here and
there to caution such as, through thoughtlessness or ignorance, might not
attend to the admonition.</p>
<p>On the days appropriated to the accommodation of students, great numbers are
to be seen in different parts of the Museum, some mounted on little stages,
others standing or sitting, all sedulously employed in copying the favourite
object of their studies. Indeed, the epithet CENTRAL has been applied to this
establishment, in order to designate a MUSEUM, which is to contain the choicest
productions of art, and, of course, become the <i>centre</i> of study. Here,
nothing has been neglected that could render such an institution useful, either
in a political light, or in regard to public instruction. Its magnificence and
splendour speak to every eye, and are calculated to attract the attention of
foreigners from the four quarters of the globe; while, as a source of
improvement, it presents to students the finest models that the arts and
sciences could assemble. In a philosophical point of view, such a Museum may be
compared to a torch, whose light will not only dispel the remnant of that bad
taste which, for a century, has predominated in the arts dependent on design,
but also serve to guide the future progress of the rising generation.</p>

<p class="fnt"><a name="let17f2">Footnote 2</a>: Whatever may be the beauty of
this vase, two others are to be seen in Paris, which surpass it, according to
the opinion of one of the most celebrated antiquaries of the age, M. VISCONTI.
They are now in the possession of M. AUBRI, doctor of Physic, residing at
N&deg;. 272, <i>Rue St. Thomas du Louvre</i>, but they formerly graced the
cabinet of the <i>Villa-Albani</i> at Rome. In this apartment, Cardinal
Alessandro had assembled some of the most valuable ornaments of antiquity. Here
were to be seen the Apollo <i>Sauroctonos</i> in bronze, the Diana in
alabaster, and the <i>unique</i> bas-relief of the apothesis of Hercules. By
the side of such rare objects of art, these vases attracted no less attention.
To describe them as they deserve, would lead me too far; they need only to be
seen to be admired. Although their form is antique, the execution of them is
modern, and ascribed to the celebrated sculptor, SILVIO DA VELETRI, who lived
in the beginning of the seventeenth century. Indeed, M. VISCONTI affirms that
antiquity affords not their equal; assigning as a reason that porphyry was
introduced into Rome at a period when the fine arts were tending to their
decline. Notwithstanding the hardness of the substance, they are executed with
such taste and perfection, that the porphyry is reduced to the thinness of
china.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let17fr2">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let18">LETTER XVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 17, 1801.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Louvre</i>, the <i>Tuileries</i>, together with the <i>National
Fête</i> in honour of Peace, and a crowd of interesting objects, have so
engrossed our attention, that we seem to have overlooked the <i>ci-devant
Palais Royal</i>. Let us then examine that noted edifice, which now bears the
name of</p>
<p class="center">PALAIS DU TRIBUNAT.</p>
<p>In 1629, Cardinal Richelieu began the construction of this palace. When
finished, in 1636, he called it the <i>Palais Cardinal</i>, a denomination
which was much criticized, as being unworthy of the founder of the French
Academy.</p>
<p>Like the politic Wolsey, who gave Hampton-Court to Henry VIII, the crafty
Richelieu, in 1639, thought proper to make a present of this palace to Lewis
XIII. After the death of that king, Anne of Austria, queen of France and regent
of the kingdom, quitted the <i>Louvre</i> to inhabit the <i>Palais
Cardinal</i>, with her sons Lewis XIV and the Duke of Anjou.</p>
<p>The first inscription was then removed, and this palace was called <i>le
Palais Royal</i>, a name which it preserved till the revolution, when, after
the new title assumed by its then owner, it was denominated <i>la Maison
Égalité</i>, till, under the consular government, since the Tribunate have here
established their sittings, it has obtained its present appellation of
<i>Palais du Tribunat</i>.</p>
<p>In the sequel, Lewis XIV granted to Monsieur, his only brother, married to
Henrietta Stuart, daughter of Charles I, the enjoyment of the <i>Palais
Royal</i>, and afterwards vested the property of it in his grandson, the Duke
of Chartres.</p>
<p>That prince, become Duke of Orleans, and regent of France, during the
minority of Lewis XV, resided in this palace, and (to use Voltaire's
expression) hence gave the signal of voluptuousness to the whole kingdom. Here
too, he ruled it with principles the most daring; holding men, in general, in
great contempt, and conceiving them to be all as insidious, as servile, and as
covetous as those by whom he was surrounded. With the superiority of his
character, he made a sport of governing this mass of individuals, as if the
task was unworthy of his genius. The fact is illustrated by the following
anecdote.</p>
<p>At the commencement of his regency, the debts of the State were immense, and
the finances exhausted: such great evils required extraordinary remedies; he
wished to persuade the people that paper-money was better than specie.
Thousands became the dupes of their avarice, and too soon awoke from their
dream only to curse the authors of a project which ended in their total ruin.
It is almost needless to mention that I here allude to the Mississippi
bubble.</p>
<p>In circumstances so critical, the Parliament of Paris thought it their duty
to make remonstrances. They accordingly sent deputies to the regent, who was
persuaded that they wished to stir up the Parisians against him. After having
listened to their harangue with much phelgm, he gave them his answer in four
words: "Go and be d----n'd." The deputy, who had addressed him, nothing
disconcerted, instantly replied: "Sir, it is the custom of the Parliament to
enter in their registers the answers which they receive from the throne: shall
they insert this?"</p>
<p>The principles of the regent's administration, which succeeded those of
Lewis XIV, form in history, a very striking shade. The French nation, which,
plastic as wax, yields to every impression, was new-modelled in a single
instant. As a rotten speck, by spreading, contaminates the finest fruit, so was
the <i>Palais Royal</i> the corrupt spot, whence the contagion of debauchery
was propagated, even to the remotest parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p>This period, infinitely curious and interesting, paved the way to the
present manners. If the basis of morality be at this day overthrown in France,
the regency of Philip of Orleans, by completing what the dissolute court of
Lewis XIV had begun, has occasioned that rapid change, whose influence was felt
long before the revolution, and will, in all probability, last for ages. At
least, I think that such a conclusion is exemplified by what has occurred in
England since the profligate reign of Charles II, the effects of whose example
have never been done away.</p>
<p>Different circumstances have produced considerable alterations in this
palace, so that, at the present day, its numerous buildings preserve of the
first architect, LE MERCIER, no more than a small part of the second court.</p>
<p>The principal entrance of the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i> is from the <i>Rue
St. Honoré</i>. The façade, on this side, which was constructed in 1763,
consists of two pavilions, ornamented by Doric and Ionic pillars, and connected
by a lofty stone-wall, perforated with arches, to three grand gates, by which
you enter the first court. Here, two elegant wings present themselves,
decorated with pilasters, also of the Doric and Ionic orders, which are
likewise employed for the pillars of the avant-corps in the centre. This
avant-corps is pierced with three arches, which serve as a passage into the
second court, and correspond with the three gates before-mentioned.</p>
<p>Having reached the vestibule, between the two courts, where large Doric
pillars rise, though partly concealed by a number of little shops and stalls,
you see, on the right, the handsome elliptical stair-case, which leads to the
apartments. It branches off into two divisions at the third step, and is
lighted by a lofty dome. The balustrade of polished iron is beautiful, and is
said to have cost thirty-two workmen two years' labour. Before the revolution,
strangers repaired hither to admire the cabinet of gems and engraved stones,
the cabinet of natural history, the collection of models of arts, trades, and
manufactures, and the famous collection of pictures, belonging to the
<i>last</i> duke of Orleans, and chiefly assembled, at a vast expense, by his
grandfather, the regent.</p>
<p>This second court is larger than the first; but it still remains in an
incomplete state. The right-hand wing only is finished, and is merely a
continuation of that which we have seen in the other court. On the left hand,
is the site of the new hall intended for the sittings of the Tribunate. Workmen
are now employed in its construction; heaps of stones and mortar are lying
about, and, the building seems to proceed with tolerable expedition. Here, in
the back-ground, is a crowd of little stalls for the sale of various articles,
such as prints, plays, fruit, and pastry. In front stand such carriages as
remain in waiting for those who may have been set down at this end of the
palace. Proceeding onward, you pass through two parallel wooden galleries,
lined on each side with shops, and enter the formerly-enchanting regions of
the</p>
<p class="center">JARDIN DU PALAIS DU TRIBUNAT.</p>
<p>The old garden of the <i>Palais Royal</i>, long famous for its shady walks,
and for being the most fashionable public promenade in Paris, had, from its
centrical situation, gradually attracted to its vicinity a considerable number
of speculators, who there opened ready-furnished hotels, coffee-houses, and
shops of various descriptions. The success of these different establishments
awakened the cupidity of its wealthy proprietor, then Duke, of Chartres, who,
conceiving that the ground might be made to yield a capital augmentation to his
income, fixed on a plan for enclosing it by a magnificent range of
buildings.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the clamours of the Parisian public, who, from long habit,
considered that they had a sort of prescriptive right to this favourite
promenade, the axe was laid to the celebrated <i>arbre de Cracovie</i> and
other venerable trees, and their stately heads were soon levelled to the
ground. Every one murmured as if these trees had been his own private property,
and cut down against his will and pleasure. This will not appear extraordinary,
when it is considered that, under their wide-spreading branches, which afforded
a shelter impervious to the sun and rain, politicians by day, adjusted the
balance of power, and arbiters of taste discussed the fashions of the moment;
while, by night, they presented a canopy, beneath which were often arranged the
clandestine bargains of opera-girls and other votaries of Venus.</p>
<p>After venting their spleen in vague conjectures, witty epigrams, and
lampoons, the Parisians were silent. They presently found that they were, in
general, not likely to be losers by this devastation. In 1782, the execution of
the new plan was begun: in less than three years, the present inclosure was
nearly completed, and the modern garden thrown open to the public, uniting to
the advantages of the ancient one, a thousand others more refined and
concentrated.</p>
<p>The form of this garden is a parallelogram, whose length is seven hundred
and two feet by three hundred in breadth, taken at its greatest dimensions. It
is bordered, on three of its sides, by new, uniform buildings, of light and
elegant architecture. Rising to an elevation of forty-two feet, these buildings
present two regular stories, exclusively of the <i>mansarde</i>, or attic
story, decorated by festoons, bas-reliefs, and large Composite fluted pillars,
bearing an entablature in whose frieze windows are pierced. Throughout its
extent, the whole edifice is crowned by a balustrade, on the pedestals of which
vases are placed at equal distances.</p>
<p>In the middle of the garden stood a most singular building, partly
subterraneous, called a <i>Cirque</i>. This circus, which was first opened in
1789, with concerts, balls, &amp;c. was also appropriated to more useful
objects, and, in 1792, a <i>Lyceum of Arts</i> was here established; but in
1797, it was consumed by fire, and its site is now occupied by a grass-plot. On
the two long sides of the garden are planted three rows of horse-chesnut trees,
not yet of sufficient growth to afford any shade; and what is new, is a few
shrubs and flowers in inclosed compartments. The walks are of gravel, and kept
in good order.</p>
<p>On the ground-floor, a covered gallery runs entirely round the garden. The
shops, &amp;c. on this floor, as well as the apartments of the <i>entresol</i>
above them, receive light by one hundred and eighty porticoes, which are open
towards the garden, and used to have each a glass lantern, with reflectors,
suspended in the middle of their arch. In lieu of these, some of a less
brilliant description are now distributed on a more economical plan under the
piazzas; but, at the close of day, the rivalship of the shopkeepers, in
displaying their various commodities, creates a blaze of light which would
strike a stranger as the effect of an illumination.</p>
<p>The fourth side of the garden towards the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i> is still
occupied by a double gallery, constructed, as I have already mentioned, of
wood, which has subsisted nearly in its present state ever since I first
visited Paris in 1784. It was to have been replaced by a colonnade for the
inclosure of the two courts. This colonnade was to have consisted of six rows
of Doric pillars, supporting a spacious picture-gallery, (intended for the
whole of the Orleans collection), which was to have constituted the fourth
façade to the garden, and have formed a covered walk, communicating with the
galleries of the other three sides.</p>
<p>These galleries, whose whole circumference measures upwards of a third of a
mile, afford to the public, even in bad weather, a walk equally agreeable and
convenient, embellished, on the one side, by the aspect of the garden, and, on
the other, by the studied display of every thing that taste and fashion can
invent to captivate the attention of passengers.</p>
<p>No place in Paris, however, exhibits such a contrast to its former
attractions as this once-fashionable rendezvous. The change of its name from
<i>Palais Royal</i> to <i>Maison Égalité</i> conveys not to the imagination a
dissimilitude more glaring than is observable between the present frequenters
of this favourite promenade, and those who were in the habit of flocking hither
before the revolution.</p>
<p>At that period, the scene was enlivened by the most brilliant and most
captivating company in the capital, both in point of exterior and manners. At
this day, the medal is exactly reversed. In lieu of well-dressed or
well-behaved persons of both sexes, this garden, including its purlieus,
presents, morning and evening, nothing but hordes of stock-jobbers,
money-brokers, gamblers, and adventurers of every description. The females who
frequent it, correspond nearly to the character of the men; they are, for the
greater part, of the most debauched and abandoned class: for a Laïs of <i>bon
ton</i> seldom ventures to shew herself among this medley of miscreants.</p>
<p>In the crowd, may be occasionally remarked a few strangers attracted by
curiosity, and other individuals of respectable appearance called hither on
business, as well as some inoffensive newsmongers, resorting to the
coffee-houses to read the papers. But, in general, the great majority, of the
company, now seen here, is of a cast so extremely low, that no decent woman,
whether married or single, thinks of appearing in a place where she would run a
risk of being put out of countenance in passing alone, even in the daytime. In
the evening, the company is of a still worse complexion; and the concourse
becomes so great under the piazzas, particularly when the inclemency of the
weather drives people out of the garden, that it is sometimes difficult to
cross through the motley assemblage. At the conclusion of the performances in
the neighbouring theatres, there is a vast accession of the inferior order of
nymphs of the Cyprian corps; and then, amorous conversation and dalliance reach
the summit of licentious freedom.</p>
<p>The greater part of the political commotions which have, at different times,
convulsed Paris, took their rise in the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i>, or it
has, in some shape, been their theatre. In this palace too originated the
dreadful reverse of fortune which the queen experienced; and, indeed, when the
cart in which her majesty was carried to the scaffold, passed before the gates
of this edifice, she was unable to repress a sign of indignation.</p>
<p>All writers who have spoken of the inveterate hatred, which existed between
the queen and M. d'Orléans, have ascribed it to despised love, whose pangs, as
Shakspeare tells, us, are not patiently endured. Some insist that the duke,
enamoured of the charms of the queen, hazarded a declaration, which her majesty
not only received with disdain, but threatened to inform the king of in case of
a renewal of his addresses. Others affirm that the queen, at one time, shewed
that the duke was not indifferent to her, and that, on a hint being given to
him to that effect, he replied: "Every one may be ambitious to please the
queen, except myself. Our interests are too opposite for Love ever to unite
them." On this foundation is built the origin of the animosity which, in the
end, brought both these great personages to the scaffold.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the motive which gave rise to it, certain it is that
they never omitted any opportunity of persecuting each other. The queen had no
difficulty in pourtraying the duke as a man addicted to the most profligate
excesses, and in alienating from him the mind of the king: he, on his side,
found it as easy, by means of surreptitious publications, to represent her as a
woman given to illicit enjoyments; so that, long before the revolution, the
character both of the queen and the duke were well known to the public; and
their example tended not a little to increase the general dissoluteness of
morals. The debaucheries of the one served as a model to all the young rakes of
fashion; while the levity of the other, was imitated by what were termed the
<i>amiable</i> women of the capital.</p>
<p>After his exile in 1788, the hatred of M. d'Orléans towards the queen roused
that ambition which he inherited from his ancestors. In watching her private
conduct, in order to expose her criminal weaknesses, he discovered a certain
political project, which gave birth to the idea of his forming a plan of a
widely-different nature. Hitherto he had given himself little trouble about
State affairs; but, in conjunction with his confidential friends, he now began
to calculate the means of profiting by the distress of his country.</p>
<p>The first shocks of the revolution had so electrified the greater part of
the Parisians, that, in regard to the Duke of Orleans, they imperceptibly
passed from profound contempt to blind infatuation. His palace became the
rendezvous of all the malcontents of the court, and his garden the place of
assembly of all the demagogues. His exile appeared a public calamity, and his
recall was celebrated as a triumph. Had he possessed a vigour of intellect, and
a daring equal to the situation of leader of a party, there is little doubt
that he might have succeeded in his plan, and been declared regent. His immense
income, amounting to upwards of three hundred thousand pounds sterling, was
employed to gain partisans, and secure the attachment of the people.</p>
<p>After the taking of the Bastille, it is admitted that his party was
sufficiently powerful to effect a revolution in his favour; but his
pusillanimity prevailed over his ambition. The active vigilance of the queen
thwarting his projects, he resolved to get rid of her; and in that intention
was the irruption of the populace directed to Versailles. This fact seems
proved: for, on some one complaining before him in 1792, that the revolution
proceeded too slowly. "It would have been terminated long ago," replied he,
"had the queen been sacrificed on the 5th of October 1789."</p>
<p>Two months before the fall of the throne, M. d'Orléans still reckoned to be
able to attain his wishes; but he soon found himself egregiously mistaken. The
factions, after mutually accusing each other of having him for their chief,
ended by deserting him; and, after the death of the king, he became a stranger
to repose, and, for the second time, an object of contempt. The necessity of
keeping up the exaltation of the people, had exhausted his fortune, great as it
was; and want of money daily detached different agents from his party. His
plate, his pictures, his furniture, his books, his trinkets, his gems, all went
to purchase the favour, and at length the protection, of the Maratists. Not
having it in his power to satisfy their cupidity, he opened loans on all sides,
and granted illusory mortgages. Having nothing more left to dispose of, he was
reduced, as a last resource, to sell his body-linen. In this very bargain was
he engaged, when he was apprehended and sent to Marseilles.</p>
<p>Although acquitted by the criminal tribunal, before which he was tried in
the south of France, he was still detained there in prison. At first, he had
shed tears, and given himself up to despair, but now hope once more revived his
spirits, and he availed himself of the indulgence granted him, by giving way to
his old habits of debauchery. On being brought to Paris after six months'
confinement, he flattered himself that he should experience the same lenity in
the capital. The jailer of the <i>Conciergerie,</i> not knowing whether M.
d'Orléans would leave that prison to ascend the throne or the scaffold, treated
him with particular respect; and he himself was impressed with the idea that he
would soon resume an ascendency in public affairs. But, on his second trial, he
was unanimously declared guilty of conspiring against the unity and
indivisibility of the Republic, and condemned to die, though no proof whatever
of his guilt was produced to the jury. One interrogatory put to him is
deserving of notice. It was this: "Did you not one day say to a deputy: <i>What
will you ask of me when I am king?</i> And did not the deputy reply: <i>I will
ask you for a pistol to blow out your brains?</i>"</p>
<p>Every one who was present at the condemnation of M. d'Orléans, and saw him
led to the guillotine affirms that if he never shewed courage before, he did at
least on that day. On hearing the sentence, he called out: "Let it be executed
directly." From the revolutionary tribunal he was conducted straight to the
scaffold, where, notwithstanding the reproaches and imprecations which
accompanied him all the way, he met his fate with unshaken firmness.</p>
<h2><a name="let19">LETTER XIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 18, 1801.</i></p>
<p>But if the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i> has been the mine of political
explosions, so it still continues to be the epitome of all the trades in Paris.
Under the arcades, on the ground-floor, here are, as formerly, shops of
jewellers, haberdashers, artificial florists, milliners, perfumers,
print-sellers, engravers, tailors, shoemakers, hatters, furriers, glovers,
confectioners, provision-merchants, woollen-drapers, mercers, cutlers, toymen,
money-changers, and booksellers, together with several coffee-houses, and
lottery-offices, all in miscellaneous succession.</p>
<p>Among this enumeration, the jewellers' shops are the most attractive in
point of splendour. The name of the proprietor is displayed in large letters of
artificial diamonds, in a conspicuous compartment facing the door. This is a
sort of signature, whose brilliancy eclipses all other names, and really
dazzles the eyes of the spectators. But at the same time it draws the attention
both of the learned and the illiterate: I will venture to affirm that the name
of one of these jewellers is more frequently spelt and pronounced than that of
any great man recorded in history, either ancient or modern.</p>
<p>With respect to the price of the commodities exposed for sale in the
<i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, it is much the same as in <i>Bond Street</i>, you
pay one third at least for the idea of fashion annexed to the name of the place
where you make the purchase, though the quality of the article may be nowise
superior to what you might procure elsewhere. As in Bond Street too, the rents
in this building are high, on which account the shopkeepers are, in some
measure, obliged to charge higher than those in other parts of the town. Not
but I must do them the justice to acknowledge that they make no scruple to
avail themselves of every prejudice formerly entertained in favour of this
grand emporium, in regard to taste, novelty, &amp;c. by a still further
increase of their prices. No small advantage to the shopkeepers established
here is the chance custom, arising from such a variety of trades being
collected together so conveniently, all within the same inclosure. A person
resorting hither to procure one thing, is sure to be reminded of some other
want, which, had not the article presented itself to his eye, would probably
have escaped his recollection; and, indeed, such is the thirst of gain, that
several tradesmen keep a small shop under these piazzas, independently of a
large warehouse in another quarter of Paris.</p>
<p>Pamphlets and other ephemeral productions usually make their first
appearance in the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>; and strangers may rely on being
plagued by a set of fellows who here hawk about prohibited publications, of the
most immoral tendency, embellished with correspondent engravings; such as
<i>Justine, ou les malheurs de la vertu, Les quarante manières, &amp;c.</i>
They seldom, I am told, carry the publication about them, for fear of being
unexpectedly apprehended, but keep it at some secret repository hard by, whence
they fetch it in an instant. It is curious to see with what adroitness these
vagrants elude the vigilance of the police, I had scarcely set my foot in this
building before a Jew-looking fellow, coming close to me, whispered in my ear:
"<i>Monsieur veut-il la vie polissonne de Madame--------?</i>" Madame who do
you think? You will stare when I tell you to fill up the blank with the name of
her who is now become the first female personage in France? I turned round with
astonishment; but the ambulating book-vender had vanished, in consequence, as I
conclude, of being observed by some <i>mouchard.</i> Thus, what little virtue
may remain in the mind of youth is contaminated by precept, as well as example;
and the rising generation is in a fair way of being even more corrupted than
that which has preceded it.</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Ætas parentum, pejor avis, tulit<br />
Nos nequiores, mox daturos<br />
Progeniem vitiosiorem.</i>"</p>
<p>Besides the shops, are some auction-rooms, where you may find any article of
wearing apparel or household furniture, from a lady's wig <i>à la Caraculla</i>
to a bed <i>à la Grecque:</i> here are as many puffers as in a mock auction in
London; and should you be tempted to bid, by the apparent cheapness of the
object put up for sale, it is fifty to one that you soon repent of your
bargain. Not so with the <i>magazins de confiance à prix fixé</i>, where are
displayed a variety of articles, marked at a fixed price, from which there is
no abatement.</p>
<p>These establishments are extremely convenient, not only to ingenious
mechanics, who have invented or improved a particular production of art, of
which they wish to dispose, but also to purchasers. You walk in, and if any
article strikes your fancy, you examine it at your ease; you consider the
materials, the workmanship, and lastly the price, without being hurried by a
loquacious shopkeeper into a purchase which you may shortly regret. A
commission of from five to one half per cent, in graduated proportions,
according to the value of the article, is charged to the seller, for
warehouse-room and all other expenses.</p>
<p>Such is the arrangement of the ground-floor; the apartments on the first
floor are at present occupied by <i>restaurateurs</i>, exhibitions of various
kinds, billiard-tables, and <i>académies de jeu</i>, or public gaming-tables,
where all the passions are let loose, and all the torments of hell
assembled.</p>
<p>The second story is let out in lodgings, furnished or unfurnished, to
persons of different descriptions, particularly to the priestesses of Venus.
The rooms above, termed <i>mansardes</i>, in the French architectural dialect,
are mostly inhabited by old batchelors, who prefer economy to show; or by
artists, who subsist by the employment of their talents. These chambers are
spacious, and though the ceilings are low, they receive a more uninterrupted
circulation of fresh air, than the less exalted regions.</p>
<p>Over the <i>mansardes</i>, in the very roof, are nests of little rooms, or
cock-lofts, resembling, I am told, the cells of a beehive. Journeymen
shopkeepers, domestics, and distressed females are said to be the principal
occupiers of these aërial abodes.</p>
<p>I had nearly forgot to mention a species of apartment little known in
England: I mean the <i>entresol</i>, which is what we should denominate a low
story, (though here not so considered), immediately above the ground-floor, and
directly under the first-floor. In this building, some of the <i>entresols</i>
are inhabited by the shopkeepers below; some, by women of no equivocal calling,
who throw out their lures to the idle youths sauntering under the arcades; and
others again are now become <i>maisons de pret</i>, where pawnbrokers exercise
their usurious dealings.</p>
<p>In the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, as you may remark, not an inch of space is
lost; every hole and corner being turned to account: here and there, the
cellars even: are converted into scenes of gaiety and diversion, where the
master of the house entertains his customers with a succession of vocal and
instrumental music, while they are taking such refreshments as he
furnishes.</p>
<p>This speculation, which has, by all accounts, proved extremely profitable,
was introduced in the early part of the revolution. Since that period, other
speculations, engendered by the luxury of the times, have been set on foot
within the precincts of this palace. Of two of these, now in full vigour and
exercise, I must say a few words, as they are of a nature somewhat curious.</p>
<p>The one is a <i>cabinet de décrotteur</i>, where the art of blacking shoes
is carried to a pitch of perfection hitherto unknown in this country.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, it was common, in Paris, to see counsellors, abbés, and
military officers, as well as <i>petits-maîtres</i> of every denomination, full
dressed, that is, with their hat under their arm, their sword by their side,
and their hair in a bag, standing in the open street, with one leg cocked up on
a stool, while a rough Savoyard or Auvergnat hastily cleaned their shoes with a
coarse mixture of lamp-black and rancid oil. At the present day, the
<i>décrotteurs</i> or shoe-blacks still exercise their profession on the
<i>Pont Neuf</i> and in other quarters; but, as a refinement of the art, there
is also opened, at each of the principal entrances of the <i>Palais du
Tribunat</i>, a <i>cabinet de décrotteur</i>, or small apartment, where you are
invited to take a chair, and presented with the daily papers.</p>
<p>The artist, with due care and expedition, first removes the dirt from your
shoes or boots with a sponge occasionally moistened in water, and by means of
several pencils, of different sizes, not unlike those of a limner, he then
covers them with a jetty varnish, rivaling even japan in lustre. This operation
he performs with a gravity and consequence that can scarcely fail to excite
laughter. Yet, according to the trite proverb, it is not the customer who ought
to indulge in mirth, but the <i>artist</i>. Although his price is much dearer
than that demanded by the other professors of this art, his cabinet is seldom
empty from morning to night; and, by a simple calculation, his pencil is found
to produce more than that of some good painters of the modern French
school.</p>
<p>At the first view of the matter, it should appear that the other speculation
might have been hit on by any man with a nose to his face; but, on more mature
consideration, one is induced to think that its author was a person of some
learning, and well read in ancient history. He, no doubt, took the hint from
VESPASIAN. As that emperor blushed not to make the urine of the citizens of
Rome a source of revenue, so the learned projector in question rightly judged
that, in a place of such resort as the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, he might,
without shame or reproach, levy a small tax on the Parisians, by providing for
their convenience in a way somewhat analogous. His penetration is not
unhandsomely rewarded; for he derives an income of 12,000 francs, or £500
sterling, from his <i>cabinets d'aisance</i>.</p>
<p>Since political causes first occasioned the shuting up of the old <i>Théâtre
Français</i> in the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, now reduced to a shell by
fire, Melpomene and Thalia have taken up their abode in the south-west angle of
the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, and in its north-west corner is another theatre,
on a smaller scale, where Momus holds his court; so that be you seriously,
sentimentally, or humorously disposed, you may, without quitting the shelter of
the piazzas, satisfy your inclination. Tragedy, Comedy, and Farce all lie
before you within the purlieus of this extraordinary edifice.</p>
<p>To sum up all the conveniences of the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, suffice it
to say, that almost every want, natural or artificial, almost every appetite,
gross or refined, might be gratified without passing its limits; for, while the
extravagant voluptuary is indulging in all the splendour of Asiatic luxury, the
parsimonious sensualist need not depart unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Placed in the middle of Paris, the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i> has been aptly
compared to a sink of vice, whose contagious effects would threaten society
with the greatest evils, were not the scandalous scenes of the capital here
concentrated into one focus. It has also been mentioned, by the same writer,
Mercier, as particularly worthy of remark, that, since this building is become
a grand theatre, where cupidity, gluttony, and licentiousness shew themselves
under every form and excess, several other quarters of Paris are, in a manner,
purified by the accumulation of vices which flourish in its centre.</p>
<p>Whether or not this assertion be strictly correct, I will not pretend to
determine: but, certain it is that the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i> is a vortex of
dissipation where many a youth is ingulfed. The natural manner in which this
may happen I shall endeavour briefly to explain, by way of conclusion to this
letter.</p>
<p>A young Frenchman, a perfect stranger in Paris, arrives there from the
country, and, wishing to equip himself in the fashion, hastens to the <i>Palais
du Tribunat</i>, where he finds wearing apparel of every description on the
<i>ground-floor</i>: prompted by a keen appetite, he dines at a
<i>restaurateur's</i> on the <i>first-floor</i>: after dinner, urged by mere
curiosity, perhaps, if not decoyed by some sharper on the look-out for novices,
he visits a public gaming-table on the same story. Fortune not smiling on him,
he retires; but, at that very moment, he meets, on the landing-place, a
captivating damsel, who, like Virgil's Galatea, flies to be pursued; and the
inexperienced youth, after ascending another flight of stairs, is, on the
<i>second-floor</i>, ushered into a brothel. Cloyed or disgusted there, he is
again induced to try the humour of the fickle goddess, and repairs once more to
the gaming-table, till, having lost all his money, he is under the necessity of
descending to the <i>entresol</i> to pawn his watch, before he can even procure
a lodging in a <i>garret</i> above.</p>
<p>What other city in Europe can boast of such an assemblage of accommodation?
Here, under the same roof, a man is, in the space of a few minutes, as
perfectly equipped from top to toe, as if he had all the first tradesmen in
London at his command; and shortly after, without setting his foot into the
street, he is as completely stripped, as if he had fallen into the hands of a
gang of robbers.</p>
<p>To cleanse this Augæan stable, would, no doubt, be a Herculean labour. For
that purpose, Merlin (of Douay), when Minister of the police, proposed to the
Directory to convert the whole of the buildings of the <i>ci-devant Palais
Royal</i> into barracks. This was certainly striking at the root of the evil;
but, probably, so bold a project was rejected, lest its execution, in those
critical times, should excite the profligate Parisians to insurrection.</p>
<h2><a name="let20">LETTER XX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 20, 1801.</i></p>
<p>One of the private entertainments here in great vogue, and which is
understood to mark a certain pre-eminence in the <i>savoir-vivre</i> of the
present day, is a nocturnal repast distinguished by the insignificant
denomination of a</p>
<p class="center">THÉ.</p>
<p>A stranger might, in all probability, be led to suppose that he was invited
to a tea-drinking party, when he receives a note couched in the following
terms:</p>
<p><i>"Madame R------ prie Monsieur B--------- de lui faire l'honneur de venir
au thé quelle doit donner le 5 de ce mois."</i></p>
<p>Considering in that light a similar invitation which I received, I was just
on the point of sending an apology, when I was informed that a <i>thé</i> was
nothing more or less than a sort of rout, followed by substantial refreshments,
and generally commencing after the evening's performance was ended at the
principal theatres.</p>
<p>On coming out of the opera-house then the other night, I repaired to the
lady's residence in question, and arriving there about twelve o'clock, found
that I had stumbled on the proper hour. As usual, there were cards, but for
those only disposed to play; for, as this lady happened not to be under the
necessity of recurring to the <i>bouillotte</i> as a financial resource, she
gave herself little or no concern about the card-tables. Being herself a very
agreeable, sprightly woman, she had invited a number of persons of both sexes
of her own character, so that the conversation was kept up with infinite
vivacity till past one o'clock, when tea and coffee were introduced. These were
immediately followed by jellies, sandwiches, pâtés, and a variety of savoury
viands, in the style of a cold supper, together with different sorts of wines
and liqueurs. In the opinion of some of the Parisian sybarites, however, no
<i>thé</i> can be complete without the addition of an article, which is here
conceived to be a perfect imitation of fashionable English cheer. This is hot
punch.</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to refuse the cheerful and engaging <i>dame du
logis</i> to taste her <i>ponche</i>, and, in compliment to me as an
Englishman, she presented me with a glass containing at least a treble
allowance. Not being overfond of punch, I would willingly have relinquished the
honour of drinking her health in so large a portion, apprehending that this
beverage might, in quality, resemble that of the same name which I had tasted
here a few evenings ago in one of the principal coffeehouses. The latter, in
fact, was a composition of new rum, which reminded me of the trash of that kind
distilled in New England, acidulated with rotten lemons, sweetened with
capillaire, and increased by a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of warm water. My
hostess's punch, on the contrary, was made of the best ingredients, agreeably
to the true standard; in a word, it was proper lady's punch, that is, hot,
sweet, sour, and strong. It was distributed in tea-pots, of beautiful
porcelaine, which, independently of keeping it longer warm, were extremely
convenient for pouring it out without spilling. Thus concluded the
entertainment.</p>
<p>About half past two o'clock the party broke up, and I returned home,
sincerely regretting the change in the mode of life of the Parisians.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the fashionable hour of dinner in Paris was three
o'clock, or at latest four: public places then began early; the curtain at the
grand French opera drew up at a quarter past five. At the present day, the
workman dines at two; the tradesman, at three; the clerk in a public office, at
four; the rich upstart, the money-broker, the stock-jobber, the contractor, at
five; the banker, the legislator, the counsellor of state, at six; and the
ministers, in general, at seven, nay not unfrequently at eight.</p>
<p>Formerly, when the performance at the opera, and the other principal
theatres, was ended at nine o'clock, or a quarter past, people of fashion
supped at ten or half after; and a man who went much into public, and kept good
company, might retire peaceably to rest by midnight. In three-fourths of the
houses in Paris, there is now no such meal as supper, except on the occasion of
a ball, when it is generally a mere scramble. This, I presume, is one reason
why substantial breakfasts are so much in fashion.</p>
<p>"<i>Déjeûners froids et chauds</i>," is an inscription which now generally
figures on the exterior of a Parisian coffeehouse, beside that of "<i>Thé à
l'Anglaise, Café à la crême, Limonade, &amp;c</i>." Solids are here the taste
of the times. Two ladies, who very gallantly invited themselves to breakfast at
my apartments the other morning, were ready to turn the house out of the
window, when they found that I presented to them nothing more than tea, coffee,
and chocolate. I was instantly obliged to provide cold fowl, ham, oysters,
white wine, &amp;c. I marvel not at the strength and vigour of these French
belles. In appetite, they would cope with an English ploughman, who had just
turned up an acre of wholesome land on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Now, though a <i>thé</i> may be considered as a substitute for a supper, it
cannot, in point of agreeableness, be compared to a <i>petit souper</i>. If a
man must sup, and I am no advocate for regular suppers, these were the suppers
to my fancy. A select number of persons, well assorted, assembled at ten
o'clock, after the opera was concluded, and spent a couple of hours in a
rational manner. Sometimes a <i>petit souper</i> consisted of a simple
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, sometimes of a <i>partie quarrée</i>, or the number was
varied at pleasure. But still, in a <i>petit souper</i>, not only much gaiety
commonly prevailed, but also a certain <i>épanchement de c&oelig;ur</i>, which
animated the conversation to such a degree as to render a party of this
description the <i>acme</i> of social intercourse, "the feast of reason and the
flow of soul."</p>
<p>Under the old <i>régime</i>, not a man was there in office, from the
<i>ministre d'état</i> to the <i>commis</i>, who did not think of making
himself amends for the fatigues of the morning by a <i>petit souper</i>: these
<i>petits soupers</i>, however, were, in latter times, carried to an excessive
pitch of luxurious extravagance. But for refinements attempted in luxury,
though, I confess, of a somewhat dissolute nature, our countryman eclipsed all
the French <i>bons vivans</i> in originality of conception.</p>
<p>Being in possession of an ample fortune, and willing to enjoy it according
to his fancy, he purchased in Paris a magnificent house, but constructed on a
small scale, where every thing that the most refined luxury could suggest was
assembled. The following is the account given by one of his friends, who had
been an eye-witness to his manner of living.</p>
<p>"Mr. B---- had made it a rule to gratify his five senses to the highest
degree of enjoyment of which they were susceptible. An exquisite table,
perfumed apartments, the charms of music and painting; in a word, every thing
most enchanting that nature, assisted by art, could produce, successively
flattered his sight, his taste, his smell, his hearing, and his feeling.</p>
<p>"In a superb saloon, whither he conducted me," says this gentleman, "were
six young beauties, dressed in an extraordinary manner, whose persons, at first
sight, did not appear unknown to me: it struck me that I had seen their faces
more than once, and I was accordingly going to address them, when Mr. B----,
smiling at my mistake, explained to me the cause of it." "I have, in my
amours," said he, "a particular fancy. The choicest beauty of Circassia would
have ho merit in my eyes, did she not resemble the portrait of some woman,
celebrated in past ages: and while lovers set great value on a miniature which
faithfully exhibits the features of their mistress, I esteem mine only in
proportion to their resemblance to ancient portraits.</p>
<p>"Conformably to this idea," continued Mr. B----, "I have caused the
intendant of my pleasures to travel all over Europe, with select portraits, or
engravings, copied from the originals. He has succeeded in his researches, as
you see, since you have conceived that you recognized these ladies on whom you
have never before set your eyes; but whose likenesses you may, undoubtedly,
have met with. Their dress must have contributed to your mistake: they all wear
the attire of the personage they represent; for I wish their whole person to be
picturesque. By these means, I have travelled back several centuries, and am in
possession of beauties whom time had placed at a great distance."</p>
<p>"Supper was served up. Mr. B---- seated himself between Mary, queen of
Scots, and Anne Bullein. I placed myself opposite to him," concludes the
gentleman, "having beside me Ninon de l'Enclos, and Gabrielle d'Estrées. We
also had the company of the fair Rosamond and Nell Gwynn; but at the head of
the table was a vacant elbow-chair, surmounted by a canopy, and destined for
Cleopatra, who was coming from Egypt, and of whose arrival Mr. B---- was in
hourly expectation."</p>
<h2><a name="let21">LETTER XXI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 21, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Often as we have heard of the extraordinary number of places of public
entertainment in Paris, few, if any, persons in England have an idea of its
being so considerable as it is, even at the present moment. But, in 1799, at
the very time when we were told over and over again in Parliament, that France
was unable to raise the necessary supplies for carrying on the war, and would,
as a matter of course, be compelled not only to relinquish her further projects
of aggrandisement, but to return to her ancient territorial limits; at that
critical period, there existed in Paris, and its environs, no less than
seventy</p>
<p class="center">PUBLIC PLACES OF VARIOUS DESCRIPTIONS.</p>
<p>Under the old <i>régime</i>, nothing like this number was ever known. Such
an almost incredible variety of amusements is really a phenomenon, in the midst
of a war, unexampled in its consumption of blood and treasure, It proves that,
whatever may have been the public distress, there was at least a great
<i>show</i> of private opulence. Indeed I have been informed that, at the
period alluded to, a spirit of indifference, prodigality, and dissipation,
seemed to pervade every class of society. Whether placed at the bottom or the
top of Fortune's wheel, a thirst of gain and want of economy were alike
conspicuous among all ranks of people. Those who strained every nerve to obtain
riches, squandered them with equal profusion.</p>
<p>No human beings on earth can be more fond of diversion than the Parisians.
Like the Romans of old, they are content if they have but <i>panem et
circenses</i>, which a Frenchman would render by <i>spectacles et de quoi
manger</i>. However divided its inhabitants may be on political subjects, on
the score of amusement at least the Republic is one and indivisible. In times
of the greatest scarcity, many a person went dinnerless to the theatre, eating
whatever scrap he could procure, and consoling himself by the idea of being
amused for the evening, and at the same time saving at home the expense of fire
and candle.</p>
<p>The following list of public places, which I have transcribed for your
satisfaction, was communicated to me by a person of veracity; and, as far as it
goes, its correctness has been confirmed by my own observation. Although it
falls short of the number existing here two years ago, it will enable you to
judge of the ardour still prevalent among the Parisians, for "running at the
ring of pleasure." Few of these places are shut up, except for the winter; and
new ones succeed almost daily to those which are finally closed. However, for
the sake of perspicuity, I shall annex the letter S to such as are intended
chiefly for summer amusement.</p>

<p>Although, previously to the revolution, the taste for dramatic amusements
had imperceptibly spread, Paris could then boast of no more than three
principal theatres, exclusively of <i>l'Opéra Buffa</i> introduced in 1788.
These were <i>l'Opéra les Français</i>, and <i>les Italiens</i>, which, with
six inferior ones, called <i>petits spectacles</i>, brought the whole of the
theatres to ten in number. The subaltern houses were incessantly checked in
their career by the privileges granted to the <i>Comédie Française</i>, which
company alone enjoyed the right to play first-rate productions: it also
possessed that of censorship, and sometimes exercised it in the most despotic
manner. Authors, ever in dispute with the comedians, who dictated the law to
them, solicited, but in vain, the opening of a second French theatre. The
revolution took place, and the unlimited number of theatres was presently
decreed. A great many new ones were opened; but the attraction of novelty
dispersing the amateurs, the number of spectators did not always equal the
expectation of the managers; and the profits, divided among so many
competitors, ceased to be sufficiently productive for the support of every
establishment of this description. The consequence was, that several of them
were soon reduced to a state of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Three theatres of the first and second rank have been destroyed by fire
within these two years, yet upwards of twenty are at present open, almost every
night, exclusively of several associations of self-denominated
<i>artistes-amateurs.</i></p>
<p>Amidst this false glare of dramatic wealth, theatres of the first rank have
imperceptibly declined, and at last fallen. It comes not within my province or
intention to seek the causes of this in the defects of their management; but
the fact is notorious. The <i>Théâtres Favart</i> and <i>Feydeau</i>, at each
of which French comic operas were chiefly represented, have at length been
obliged to unite the strength of their talents, and the disgrace which they
have experienced, has not affected any of those inferior playhouses where
subaltern performers establish their success on an assemblage of scenes more
coarse, and language more unpolished.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the government appear to have taken this decline of
the principal theatres into serious consideration. It is, I understand, alike
to be apprehended, that they may concern themselves too little or too much in
their welfare. Hitherto the persons charged with the difficult task of
upholding the falling theatres of the first rank, have had the good sense to
confine their measures to conciliation; but, of late, it has been rumoured that
the stage is to be subjected to its former restrictions. <a name="let21fr1">
</a>The benefit resulting to the art itself and to the public, from a rivalship
of theatres, is once more called in question: and some people even go so far as
to assert that, with the exception of a few abuses, the direction of the
<i>Gentils-hommes de la chambre</i> was extremely good: thence it should seem
that the only difficulty is to find these lords of the bed-chamber, if there be
any still in being, in order to restore to them their dramatic
sceptre.[<a href="#let21f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>Doubtless, the liberty introduced by the revolution has been, in many
respects, abused, and in too many, perhaps, relative to places of public
amusement. But must it, on that account, be entirely lost to the stage, and
falling into a contrary excess, must recourse be had to arbitrary measures,
which might also be abused by those to whose execution they were intrusted? The
unlimited number of theatres may be a proper subject for the interference of
the government: but as to the liberty of the theatres, included in the number
that may be fixed on to represent pieces of every description, such only
excepted as may be hurtful to morals, seems to be a salutary and incontestable
principle. This it is that, by disengaging the French comic opera from the
narrow sphere to which it was confined, has, in a great measure, effected a
musical revolution, at which all persons of taste must rejoice, by introducing
on that stage the harmonic riches of Italy. This too it is that has produced,
on theatres of the second and third rank, pieces which are neither deficient in
regularity, connexion, representation, nor decoration. The effect of such a
principle was long wanted here before the revolution, when the independent
spirit of dramatic authors was fettered by the procrastinations of a set of
privileged comedians, who discouraged them by ungracious refusals, or disgusted
them by unjust preferences. Hence, the old adage in France that, when an author
had composed a good piece, he had performed but half his task; this was true,
as the more difficult half, namely, the getting it read and represented, still
remained to be accomplished.</p>
<p>As for the multiplicity of playhouses, it certainly belongs to the
government to limit their number, not by privileges which might be granted
through favour, or obtained, perhaps, for money. The taste of the public for
theatrical diversions being known, the population should first be considered,
as it is that which furnishes both money and spectators. It would be easy to
ascertain the proportion between the population of the capital and the number
of theatres which it ought to comprise. Public places should be free as to the
species of amusement, but limited in their number, so as not to exceed the
proportion which the population can bear. The houses would then be constantly
well attended, and the proprietors, actors, authors, and all those concerned in
their success, secure against the consequences of failure, and the true
interest of the art be likewise promoted. In a word, neither absolute
independence, nor exclusive privilege should prevail; but a middle course be
adopted, in order to fix the fate of those great scenic establishments, which,
by forming so essential a part of public diversion, have a proportionate
influence on the morals of the nation.</p>
<p>I have been led, by degrees, into these observations, not only from a review
of the decline of some of the principal playhouses here, but also from a
conviction that their general principle is applicable to every other capital in
Europe. What, for example, can be more absurd than, in the dog-days, when room
and air are particularly requisite, that the lovers of dramatic amusement in
the British metropolis are to be crammed into a little theatre in the
Haymarket, and stewed year after year, as in a sweating-room at a bagnio,
because half a century ago an exclusive privilege was inconsiderately
granted?</p>
<p>The playhouses here, in general, have been well attended this winter,
particularly the principal ones; but, in Paris, every rank has not exactly its
theatre as at a ball. From the <i>spectacles</i> on the <i>Boulevards</i> to
those of the first and second rank, there is a mixture of company. Formerly,
the lower classes confined themselves solely to the former; at present, they
visit the latter. An increase of wages has enabled the workman to gratify his
inclination for the indulgence of a species of luxury; and, by a sort of
instinct, he now and then takes a peep at those scenes of which he before
entertained, from hearsay, but an imperfect idea.</p>
<p>If you wish to see a new or favourite piece, you must not neglect to secure
a seat in proper time; for, on such occasions, the house is full long before
the rising of the curtain. As to taking places in the manner we do in England,
there is no such arrangement to be made, except, indeed, you choose to take a
whole box, which is expensive. <a name="let20fr2"></a>In that case you pay for
it at the time you engage it, and it is kept locked the whole evening, or till
you and your party, make your appearance.[<a href="#let20f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>At all the <i>spectacles</i> in Paris, you are literally kept on the outside
of the house till you have received a ticket, in exchange for your money,
through an aperture in the exterior wall. Within a few paces of the door of the
principal theatres are two receiver's offices, which are no sooner open, than
candidates for admission begin to form long ranks, extending from the portico
into the very street, and advance to them two abreast in regular succession. A
steady sentinel, posted at the aperture, repeats your wishes to the receiver,
and in a mild, conciliating manner, facilitates their accomplishment. Other
sentinels are stationed for the preservation of order, under the immediate eye
of the officer, who sees that every one takes his turn to obtain tickets:
however, it is not uncommon, for forestallers to procure a certain number of
them, especially at the representation of a new or favourite piece, and offer
them privately at a usurious price which many persons are glad to pay rather
than fall into the rear of the ranks.</p>
<p>The method I always take to avoid this unpleasant necessity, I will
recommend to you as a very simple one, which may, perhaps, prevent you from
many a theatrical disappointment. Having previously informed myself what
<i>spectacle</i> is best worth seeing, while I am at dinner I send my <i>valet
de place</i>, or if I cannot conveniently spare him, I desire him to dispatch a
<i>commissionnaire</i> for the number of tickets wanted, so that when I arrive
at the theatre, I have only to walk in, and place myself to the best
advantage.</p>
<p>It is very wisely imagined not to establish the receiver's offices in the
inside of the house, as in our theatres. By this plan, however great may be the
crowd, the entrance is always unobstructed, and those violent struggles and
pressures, which among us have cost the lives of many, are effectually
prevented. You will observe that no half-price is taken at any theatre in
Paris; but in different parts of the house, there are offices, called
<i>bureaux de supplément</i>, where, if you want to pass from one part of it to
another, you exchange your counter-mark on paying the difference.</p>
<p>Nothing can be better regulated than the present police, both interior and
exterior, of the theatres in Paris. The eye is not shocked, as was formerly the
case, by the presence of black-whiskered grenadiers, occupying different parts
of the house, and, by the inflexible sternness of their countenance, awing the
spectators into a suppression of their feelings. No fusileer, with a fixed
bayonet and piece loaded with ball, now dictates to the auditors of the pit
that such a seat must hold so many persons, though several among them might,
probably, be as broad-bottomed as Dutchmen. If you find yourself incommoded by
heat or pressure, you are at liberty to declare it without fear of giving
offence. The criticism of a man of taste is no longer silenced by the arbitrary
control of a military despot, who, for an exclamation or gesture, not exactly
coinciding with his own prepossessions, pointed him out to his myrmidons, and
transferred him at once to prison. You may now laugh with Molèire, or weep with
Racine, without having your mirth or sensibility thus unseasonably checked in
its expansion.</p>
<p>The existence of this despotism has been denied; but facts are stubborn
things, and I will relate to you an instance in which I saw it most wantonly
exercised. Some years ago I was present at the <i>Théâtre Français</i>, when,
in one of Corneille's pieces, Mademoiselle Raucourt, the tragic actress, was
particularly negligent in the delivery of a passage, which, to do justice to
the author, required the nicest discrimination. An amateur in the
<i>parterre</i> reproved her, in a very gentle manner, for a wrong emphasis.
Being at this time a favourite of the queen, she was, it seems, superior to
admonition, and persisted in her misplaced shrieks, till it became evident that
she set the audience at defiance: other persons then joined the former in
expressing their disapprobation. Instantly the <i>major</i> singled out the
leading critic: two grenadiers forced their way to the place where he was
seated, and conveyed him to prison for having had the audacity to reprove an
actress in favour at court. From such improper exercise of authority, the
following verse had become a proverb:</p>
<p class="center"><i>"II est bien des sifflets, mais nous avons la
garde."</i></p>
<p>Many there are, I know, who approved of this manner of bridling the fickle
Parisians, on the ground that they were so used to the curb that they could no
longer dispense with it. A guard on the outside of a theatre is unquestionably
necessary, and proper for the preservation of order; but that the public should
not be at liberty to approve or condemn such a passage, or such an actor, is at
once to stifle the expression of that general opinion which alone can produce
good performers. The interior police of the theatre being at present almost
entirely in the hands of the public themselves, it is, on that account, more
justly observed and duly respected.</p>
<p>Considering the natural impetuosity of their character, one is surprised at
the patient tranquillity with which the French range themselves in their
places. Seldom do they interrupt the performance by loud conversation, but
exchange their thoughts in a whisper. When one sees them applaud with rapture a
tender scene, which breathes sentiments of humanity or compassion, speaks home
to every feeling heart, and inspires the most agreeable sensations, one is
tempted to question whether the Parisians of the present day belong to the
identical race that could, at one time, display the ferocity of tigers, and, at
another, the tameness of lambs, while their nearest relations and best friends
were daily bleeding on the scaffold?</p>
<p>By the existing regulations, many of which are worthy of being adopted in
London, no theatre can be opened in Paris without the permission of the police,
who depute proper persons to ascertain that the house is solidly built, the
passages and outlets unincumbered and commodious, and that it is provided with
reservoirs of water, and an adequate number of fire-engines.</p>
<p>Every public place that may be open, is to be shut up immediately, if, for
one single day, the proprietors neglect to keep the reservoirs full of water,
the engines in proper order, and the firemen ready.</p>
<p>No persons can be admitted behind the scenes, except those employed in the
service of the theatre. Nor is the number of tickets distributed to exceed that
of the persons the house can conveniently hold.</p>
<p>No coachman, under any pretext whatever, can quit the reins of his horses,
while the persons he has driven, are getting out of or into their carriage.
Indeed, the necessity of his doing so is obviated by porters stationed at the
door of the theatres, and appointed by the police. They are distinguished by a
brass plate, on which their permission and the name of the theatre are
engraved.</p>
<p>At all the theatres in Paris, there is an exterior guard, which is at the
disposal of the <i>civil</i> officer, stationed there for the preservation of
order. This guard cannot enter the inside of the theatre but in case of the
safety of the public being exposed, and at the express requisition of the said
officer, who can never introduce the armed force into the house, till after he
has, in a loud voice, apprized the audience of his intention.</p>
<p>Every citizen is bound to obey, <i>provisionally</i>, the officer of police.
In consequence, every person invited by the officer of police, or summoned by
him, to quit the house, is immediately to repair to the police-office of the
theatre, in order to give such explanations as may be required of him. The said
officer may either transfer him to the competent tribunal, or set him at
liberty, according to circumstances.</p>
<p>Proper places are appointed for carriages to wait at. When the play is
ended, no carriage in waiting can move till the first crowd coming out of the
house has disappeared. The commanding officer of the guard on duty decides the
moment when carriages may be called.</p>
<p>No carriage can move quicker than a foot-pace, and but on a single rank,
till it has got clear of the streets in the vicinity of the theatre. Nor can it
arrive thither but by the streets appointed for that purpose.</p>
<p>Two hours before the rising of the curtain, sentinels are placed in
sufficient number to facilitate the execution of these orders, and to prevent
any obstruction in the different avenues of the theatre.</p>
<p>Indeed, obstruction is now seldom seen; I have more than once had the
curiosity to count, and cause to be counted, all the <i>private</i> carriages
in waiting at the grand French opera, on a night when the boxes were filled
with the most fashionable company. Neither I nor my <i>valet de place</i> could
ever reckon more than from forty to fifty; whereas, formerly, it was not
uncommon to see here between two and three hundred; and the noise of so many
equipages rattling through the streets, from each of the principal theatres,
sufficiently indicated that the performance was ended.</p>
<p>By the number of advertisements in the <i>petites affiches</i> or daily
advertiser of Paris, offering a reward for articles lost, no doubt can exist of
there being a vast number of pickpockets in this gay capital; and a stranger
must naturally draw such an inference from observing where the pockets are
placed in men's clothes: in the coat, it is in the inside of the facing,
parallel to the breast: in the waistcoat, it is also in the inside, but lower
down, so that when a Frenchman wants to take out his money, he must go through
the ceremony of unbuttoning first his surtout, if he wears one in winter, then
his coat, and lastly his waistcoat. In this respect, the ladies have the
advantage; for, as I have already mentioned, they wear no pockets.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let21f1">Footnote 1</a>: During the old <i>régime</i>,
the theatres were under the control of the <i>Gentils-hommes de la chambre</i>,
but at the establishment of the directorial government, they were placed in the
power of the Minister of the Interior, in whose department they have since
continued. Of late, however, it is asserted, that they are each to be under the

<h2><a name="let22">LETTER XXII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 23, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Yesterday being the day appointed for the opening of the session of the
Legislative Body, I was invited by a member to accompany him thither, in order
to witness their proceedings. No one can be admitted without a ticket; and by
the last constitution it is decreed, that not more than two hundred strangers
are to be present at the sittings. The gallery allotted for the accommodation
of the public, is small, even in proportion to that number, and, in general,
extremely crowded. My friend, aware of this circumstance, did me the favour to
introduce me into the body of the hall, where I was seated very conveniently,
both for seeing and hearing, near the <i>tribune</i>, to the left of the
President.</p>
<p>This hall was built for the Council of Five Hundred, on the site of the
grand apartments of the <i>Palais Bourbon</i>. Since the accession of the
consular government, it has been appropriated to the sittings of the
Legislative Body, on which account the palace has taken their name, and over
the principal entrance is inscribed, in embossed characters of gilt bronze:</p>
<p class="center">PALAIS DU CORPS LÉGISLATIF.</p>
<p>The palace stands on the south bank of the Seine, facing the <i>Pont de la
Concorde</i>. It was begun, in 1722, for Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, a
legitimated daughter of Lewis XIV. GIRARDINI, an Italian architect, planned the
original building, the construction of which was afterwards superintended by
LASSURANCE and GABRIEL. The Prince de Condé having acquired it by purchase, he
caused it to be considerably augmented and embellished, at different times,
under the direction of BARRAU, CARPENTIER and BÉLISARD.</p>
<p>Had the <i>Pont de la Concorde</i> subsisted previously to the erection of
the <i>Palais Bourbon</i>, the principal entrance would, probably, have been
placed towards the river; but it faces the north, and is preceded by a paltry
square, now called <i>Place du Corps Législatif</i>.</p>
<p>In the centre of a peristyle, of the Corinthian order, is the grand gateway,
crowned by a sort of triumphal arch, which is connected, by a double colonnade,
to two handsome pavilions. The lateral buildings of the outer court, which is
two hundred and eighty feet in length, are decorated with the same order, and a
second court of two hundred and forty feet, includes part of the original
palace, which is constructed in the Italian style.</p>
<p>The principal entrances to the right and left lead to two halls; the one
dedicated to <i>Peace</i>; the other, to <i>Victory</i>. On the one side, is a
communication to the apartments of the old palace; on the other, are two
spacious rooms. The room to the left, inscribed to <i>Liberty</i>, is intended
for petitioners, &amp;c.; that to the right, inscribed to <i>Equality</i>, is
appropriated to conferences. Between the halls of Liberty and Equality, is the
hall of the sittings of the Legislative Body.</p>
<p>The form of this hall is semicircular; the benches, rising gradually one
above the other, as in a Roman amphitheatre, are provided with backs, and well
adapted both for ease and convenience. They are intersected by passages, which
afford to the members the facility of reaching or quitting their places,
without disturbance or confusion. Every seat is distinguished by a number, so
that a deputy can never be at a loss to find his place. In the centre, is an
elevated rostrum, with a seat for the President, directly under which is the
<i>tribune</i>, also elevated, for the orator addressing the assembly. The
tribune is decorated by a bas-relief, in white marble, representing France
writing her constitution, and Fame proclaiming it. The table for the four
secretaries is placed facing the tribune, beneath which the <i>huissiers</i>
take their station. The desk and seat of the President, formed of solid
mahogany, are ornamented with <i>or moulu</i>. The folding doors, which open
into the hall, to the right and left of the President's chair, are also of
solid mahogany, embellished in the same manner. Their frames are of white
marble, richly sculptured. Independently of these doors, there are others,
serving as a communication to the upper-seats, by means of two elegant stone
stair-cases.</p>
<p>In six niches, three on each side of the tribune, are so many statues of
Greek and Roman legislators. On the right, are Lycurgus, Solon, and
Demosthenes: on the left, Brutus, Cato, and Cicero. The inside of the hall is
in stucco, and the upper part is decorated by a colonnade of the Ionic order.
The light proceeds from a cupola, glazed in the centre, and the remainder of
which is divided into small compartments, each ornamented by an emblematical
figure. The floor is paved with marble, also in compartments, embellished with
allegorical attributes.</p>
<p>Having made you acquainted with the hall of the sittings, I think it may not
be uninteresting to give you an account of the forms observed in opening the
session.</p>
<p>When I arrived, with my friend, at the Palace of the Legislative Body, most
of the members were already assembled in the apartments of their library. At
noon, they thence repaired to the hall, preceded by the <i>huissiers</i>,
messengers of state, and secretaries.</p>
<p>The opening of the session was announced by the report of artillery.</p>
<p>The oldest member, in point of years, took the President's chair,
provisionally.</p>
<p>The four youngest members of the assembly were called to the table to
discharge the office of secretaries, also provisionally.</p>
<p>The provisional President then declared, that the members of the Legislative
Body were assembled by virtue of Article XXXIII of the constitution, for the
session of the year X; that, being provisionally organized, the sitting was
opened; and that their names were going to be called over, for the purpose of
ascertaining the number of members present, and for forming definitive
arrangements, by the nomination of a president and four secretaries.</p>
<p>The names were then called over alphabetically, and, after they were all
gone through, they were recalled.</p>
<p>This ceremony being terminated, four committees, each composed of four
members, whose names were drawn by lot by the President, proceeded, in presence
of the assembly, to scrutinize the ballot.</p>
<p>It thence resulted, that the number of members present was two hundred and
twenty-eight;</p>
<p>That Citizen DUPUIS was elected President by a majority of votes;</p>
<p>That Citizens DUBOSC, BORD, ESTAQUE, and CLAVIER were individually elected,
by a similar majority, to officiate as secretaries.</p>
<p>In consequence. Citizen DUPUIS was proclaimed President, and took the chair.
He then moved the following resolution, which was agreed to:</p>
<p>"The Legislative Body declares, that it is definitely constituted, and
decrees that the present declaration shall be carried to the Conservative
Senate, to the Tribunate, and to the Consuls of the Republic, by a messenger of
State."</p>
<p>The President next addressed the assembly in these words:</p>
<p>"Citizens Legislators,</p>
<p>"After twelve years of a painful and glorious struggle against all Europe,
in order to insure the triumph of the liberty of man and that of nations, the
moment is at length arrived when Peace is on the point of crowning the efforts
of the French people, and securing the Republic on a foundation never to be
shaken. For this peace, which will unite by the bonds of friendship two great
nations, already connected by esteem, we are indebted to the valour and wisdom
of the heroic pacificator, to the wise administration of the government, to the
bravery of our invincible armies, to the good understanding subsisting between
all the constituted authorities, and, above all, to that spirit of moderation
which has known how to fix limits to victory itself. The name of peace, so dear
to the friend of human nature, ought to impose silence on all malignant
passions, cordially unite all the children of the same country, and be the
signal of happiness to the present generation, as well as to our posterity.</p>
<p>"How gratifying is it to us, Citizens Legislators, after having passed
through the storms of a long revolution, to have at length brought safely into
port the sacred bark of the Republic, and to begin this session by the
proclamation of peace to the world, as those who preceded us opened theirs by
the proclamation of the Rights of Man and that of the Republic! To crown this
great work, nothing more remains for us but to make those laws so long
expected, which are to complete social organization, and regulate the interests
of citizens. This code, already prepared by men of consummate prudence, will, I
hope, be soon submitted to your examination and sanction; and the present
session will be the most glorious epoch of our Republic: for there is nothing
more glorious to man than to insure the happiness of his fellow-creatures, and
scatter beforehand the first seeds of the liberty of the world."</p>
<p>"<i>L'impression! L'impression!</i>" was the cry that instantly proceeded
from bench to bench on the close of this speech, which was delivered in a
manner that did honour to the President's feelings. But, though you have it, as
it were, at second-hand, and cannot be struck by Citizen DUPUIS' manner, I hope
you will deem the matter sufficiently interesting to justify its insertion in
this letter.</p>
<p>Three orators, deputed by the government, were next announced, and
introduced in form. They were habited in their dress of Counsellors of State,
that is, a scarlet coat, richly embroidered in shaded silks of the same colour,
over which they wore a tricoloured silk sash.</p>
<p>One of them, having ascended the tribune, and obtained leave to speak, read
an extract from the registers of the Council of State, dated the 24th of
Brumaire, purporting that the First Consul had nominated the Counsellors of
State, REGNIER, BÉRENGER, and DUMAS to repair to the present sitting. Citizen
REGNIER then addressed the assembly in the name of the government. He read his
speech from a paper which he held in his hand. It began by announcing the
signature of the preliminaries of peace with England, and informed the
Legislative Body that measures had been taken by the government for regulating
the various branches of the interior administration and of its intention to
submit to them the civil code. It was replete with language of a conciliating
nature, and concluded with a wish that the most unalterable harmony might
subsist between the first authorities of the State, and strengthen in the mind
of the people the confidence which they already testified.</p>
<p>From the tenour of this speech, I think it may be inferred that the
government is apprehensive of a difference of opinion respecting the civil
code; not so much in this place, for, by the constitution, the lips of the
deputies are sealed, but in the Tribunate, where a warm discussion may be
expected.</p>
<p>The President made a short and apt reply to the orators of the government,
who then retired with the same ceremony with which they had entered. Both these
speeches were ordered to be printed.</p>
<p>The Conservative Senate addressed to the Legislative Body, by a message read
by the President, the different acts emanated from its authority since the last
session. Ordered to be inserted in the Journals. A few letters were also read
by the President from different members, excusing themselves for non-attendance
on account of indisposition. Several authors having addressed a copy of their
works to the Legislative Body, these presents were accepted, and ordered to be
placed in their library.</p>
<p>The administrative commission of the Legislative Body announced that the
ambassador of the Cisalpine Republic had sent a present of three hundred
medals, struck on occasion of the peace and of the <i>forum Bonaparte</i>,
which medals were distributed to the members.</p>
<p>The assembly the broke up, the next sitting being appointed for the
following day at noon.</p>
<p>Lord Cornwallis and suite sat in the box allotted to Foreign Ministers,
facing the President, as did the Marquis de Lucchesini, the Prussian
ambassador, and some others. A small box is likewise appropriated to reporters,
who take down the proceedings. The members were all habited in their appointed
dress, which consists of a dark blue coat embroidered with gold, blue
pantaloons and white waistcoat, also embroidered, a tricoloured silk sash, worn
above the coat, and ornamented with a rich gold fringe. They wore a plain
cocked hat, with the national cockade, and short boots. This meeting of
legislators, all in the same dress, undoubtedly presents a more imposing
spectacle than such a variegated assemblage as is sometimes to be seen in our
House of Commons.</p>
<p>By the present constitution, you will see that no new law can be
promulgated, unless decreed by the Legislative Body.</p>
<p>The votes in this assembly being taken by ballot, and the laws being enacted
without any discussion, on the part of its members, on the plans debated before
it by the orators of the Tribunate and of the government, it necessarily
follows that the sittings present far less interest to strangers, than would
result from an animated delivery of the opinion of a few leading orators.</p>
<p>Before I take leave of this palace, I must introduce you into the suite of
rooms formerly distinguished by the appellation of <i>petits appartemens du
Palais Bourbon</i>, and which, before the revolution, constituted one of the
curiosities of Paris.</p>
<p>In the distribution of these, BÉLISARD assembled all the charms of modern
elegance. The vestibule, coloured in French gray, contains, in the intervals
between the doors, figures of Bacchantes, and, in the ceiling, wreaths of roses
and other ornaments painted in imitation of relief. The eating-room, which
comes next, is decorated so as to represent a verdant bower, the paintings are
under mirrors, and tin-plate, cut out in the Chinese manner, seems to shew
light through the foliage. In two niches, made in the arbour-work, in the form
of porticoes, which Cupids are crowning with garlands, are placed two statues
from the antique, the one representing Venus <i>pudica</i>, and the other,
Venus <i>callypyga</i>, or <i>aux belles fesses</i>: mirrors, placed in the
niches, reflect beauties which the eye could not discover.</p>
<p>The drawing room, another enchanting place, is of a circular form,
surrounded with Ionic pillars. In the intercolumniations, are arches lined with
mirrors, and ornamented with the most tasteful hangings. Under each arch is a
sopha. The ceiling represents caryatides supporting a circular gallery, between
which are different subjects, such as the Toilet of Venus, the Departure of
Adonis, &amp;c. Every thing here is gallant and rich; but mark the secret
wonder. You pull a string; the ceiling rises like a cloud, and exhibits to view
an extensive sky, with which it becomes confounded. The music of an invisible
orchestra, placed above the ceiling, used to be heard through the opening, and
produced a charming effect, when entertainments were given in these
apartments.</p>
<p>This is not all. You pull another string; and, by means of concealed
machinery, the aperture of the three casements suddenly becomes occupied by
pannels of mirrors, so that you may here instantly turn day into night. The
bed-chamber, the <i>boudoir</i>, the study, &amp;c., are all decorated in a
style equally elegant and tasteful.</p>
<h2><a name="let23">LETTER XXIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 25, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Of all the public edifices in this capital, I know of none whose interior
astonishes so much, at first sight, and so justly claims admiration, especially
from those who have a knowledge of architecture or mechanics, as the</p>
<p class="center">HALLE AU BLÉ.</p>
<p>This building is destined for the reception of corn and flour: it was begun
in 1762, on the site of the ancient <i>Hôtel de Soissons</i>, which was
purchased by the city of Paris. In the space of three years, the hall and the
circumjacent houses were finished, under the direction of the architect, CAMUS
DE MEZIÈRE</p>
<p>The circular form of this hall, the solidity of its construction, its
insulated position, together with the noble simplicity of its decoration,
perfectly accord with the intention and character of the object proposed.
Twenty-five arches, all of equal size, serve each as an entrance. On the
ground-floor are pillars of the Tuscan order, supporting vast granaries, the
communication to which is by two stair-cases of well-executed design.</p>
<p>The court is covered by a cupola of one hundred and twenty feet in diameter,
forming a perfect semicircle, whose centre, taken on a level with the cornice,
is forty-four feet from the ground. The dome of the Pantheon at Rome, which is
the largest known, exceeds that of the <i>Halle au Blé</i> by thirteen feet
only. This cupola is entirely composed of deal boards, a foot in breadth, an
inch in thickness, and about four feet in length. It is divided into
twenty-five lateral openings, which give as many rays of light diverging from
the centre-opening, whose diameter is twenty-four feet. These openings are all
glazed, and the wood-work of the dome is covered with sheets of tinned
copper.</p>
<p>PHILIBERT DE L'ORME, architect to Henry II, was the original author of this
new method of covering domes, though he never carried it into execution. As a
homage for the discovery, MOLINOS and LEGRAND, the architects of the cupola,
have there placed a medallion with his portrait. It is said that this
experiment was deemed so hazardous, that the builder could find no person bold
enough to strike away the shores, and was under the necessity of performing
that task in person. To him it was not a fearful one; but the workmen,
unacquainted with the principles of this manner of roofing buildings, were
astonished at the stability of the dome, when the shores were removed.</p>
<p>No place in Paris could well be more convenient for giving a banquet than
the <i>Halle au Blé</i>; twelve or fourteen hundred persons might here be
accommodated at table; and little expense would be required for decoration, as
nothing can be more elegant than the cupola itself.</p>
<p>Several periodical publications give a statement, more or less exact, of the
quantity of flour lodged in this spacious repository, which is filled and
emptied regularly every four or five days. But these statements present not the
real consumption of Paris, since several bakers draw their supply directly from
the farmers of the environs; and, besides, a great quantity of loaves are
brought into the capital from some villages, famous for making bread, whose
inhabitants come and retail them to the Parisians.</p>
<p>The annual consumption of bread-corn in this capital has, on an average,
been computed at twenty-four millions of bushels. But it is not the consumption
only that it is useful to know: the most material point to be ascertained, is
the method of providing effectually for it; so that, from a succession of
unfavourable harvests, or any other cause, the regular supplies may not
experience even a momentary interruption. When it is considered that Paris
contains eight or nine hundred thousand of the human race, it is evident that
this branch of administration requires all the vigilance of the government.</p>
<p>Bread is now reckoned enormously dear, nineteen <i>sous</i> for the loaf of
four pounds; but, during the winter of 1794, the Parisians felt all the horrors
of a real famine. Among other articles of the first necessity, bread was then
so scarce, that long ranks of people were formed at the doors of the bakers'
shops, each waiting in turn to receive a scanty portion of two ounces.</p>
<p>The consumption of flour here is considerably increased by the immense
number of dogs, cats, monkies, parrots, and other birds, kept by persons of
every class, and fed chiefly on bread and biscuit.</p>
<p>No poor devil that has not in his miserable lodging a dog to keep him
company: not being able to find a friend among his own species, he seeks one in
the brute creation. A pauper of this description, who shared his daily bread
with his faithful companion, being urged to part with an animal that cost him
so much to maintain: "Part with him!" rejoined he; "who then shall I get to
love me?"</p>
<p>Near the <i>Halle au Blé</i>, stands a large fluted pillar of the Doric
order, which formerly belonged to the <i>Hôtel de Soissons</i>, and served as
an observatory to Catherine de Medicis. In the inside, is a winding stair-case,
leading to the top, whither that diabolical woman used frequently to ascend,
accompanied by astrologers, and there perform several mysterious ceremonies, in
order to discover futurity in the stars. She wore on her stomach a skin of
parchment, strewn with figures, letters, and characters of different colours;
which skin she was persuaded had the virtue of insuring her from any attempt
against her person.</p>
<p>Much about that period, 1572, there were reckoned, in Paris alone, no less
than thirty thousand astrologers. At the present day, the ambulating magicians
frequent the <i>Old Boulevards</i>, and there tell fortunes for three or four
<i>sous</i>; while those persons that value science according to the price set
on it, disdaining these two-penny conjurers, repair to fortune-tellers of a
superior class, who take from three to six francs, and more, when the
opportunity offers. The TROPHONIUS of Paris is Citizen Martin, who lives at
N&deg; 1773 <i>Rue d'Anjou</i>: the PHEMONOË is Madame Villeneuve, <i>Rue de
l'Antechrist</i>.</p>
<p>Formerly, none but courtesans here drew the cards; now, almost every female,
without exception, has recourse to them. Many a fine lady even conceives
herself to be sufficiently mistress of the art to tell her own fortune; and
some think they are so skilled in reading futurity in the cards, that they dare
not venture to draw them for themselves, for fear of discovering some untoward
event.</p>
<p>This rage of astrology and fortune-telling is a disease which peculiarly
affects weak intellects, ruled by ignorance, or afflicted by adversity. In the
future, such persons seek a mitigation of the present; and the illusive
enjoyments of the mind make them almost forget the real sufferings of the body.
According to Pope,</p>
<p class="bq">
"Hope springs eternal in the human breast,<br />
Man never <i>is</i>, but always <i>to be</i> blest."<br />
</p>
<p>At the foot of the above pillar, the only one of the sort in Paris, is
erected a handsome fountain, which furnishes water from the Seine. At
two-thirds of its height is a dial of a singular kind, which marks the precise
hour at every period of the day, and in all seasons. It is the invention of
Father Pingré, who was a regular canon of St. Geneviève, and member of the
<i>ci-devant</i> Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>While we are in this quarter, let us avail ourselves of the moment; and,
proceeding from the <i>Halle au Blé</i> along the <i>Rue Oblin</i>, examine
the</p>
<p class="center">CHURCH OF SAINT EUSTACHE.</p>
<p>This church, which is one of the most spacious in Paris, is situated at the
north extremity of the <i>Rue des Prouvaires</i>, facing the <i>Rue du
Jour</i>. It was begun in 1532, but not finished till the year 1642.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the richness of its architecture, it presents not an
appearance uniformly handsome, on account of the ill-combined mixture of the
Greek and Gothic styles: besides, the pillars are so numerous in it, that it is
necessary to be placed in the nave to view it to the best advantage.</p>
<p>The new portal of <i>St. Eustache</i>, which was constructed in 1754, is
formed of two orders, the Doric and the Ionic, the one above the other. At each
extremity of this portal, rise two insulated towers, receding from all the
projection of the inferior order, and decorated by Corinthian columns with
pilasters, on an attic serving as a socle. These two towers were to have been
crowned by a balustrade; one alone has been finished.</p>
<p>Several celebrated personages have been interred in this church. Among them,
I shall particularize one only; but that one will long live in the memory of
every convivial British seaman. Who has not heard the lay which records the
defeat of Tourville? Yes&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
He who "on the main triumphant rode<br />
To meet the gallant Russel in combat o'er the deep;"<br />
Who "led his noble troops of heroes bold<br />
To sink the English admiral and his fleet."<br />
</p>
<p>Though considered by his countrymen, as one of the most eminent seamen that
France ever produced, and enjoying at the time of his death the dignity of
Marshal, together with that of Vice-admiral of the kingdom, Tourville never had
an epitaph. He died on the 28th of May 1701, aged 59.</p>
<p>Some of the monuments which existed here have been transferred to the Museum
in the <i>Rue des Petits Augustins</i>, where may be seen the sarcophagus of
Colbert, Minister to Lewis XIV, and the medallion of Cureau de la Chambre,
physician to that king, and also his physiognomist, whom he is said to have
constantly consulted in the selection of his ministers. Among the papers of
that physician there still exists, in an unpublished correspondence with Lewis
XIV, this curious memorandum: "Should I die before his majesty, he would run a
great risk of making, in future, many a bad choice."</p>
<p>It is impossible to enter one of these sanctuaries without reflecting on the
rapid progress of irreligion among a people who, six months before, were, on
their knees, adoring the effigies which, at that period, they were eager to
mutilate and destroy. Iron crows and sledge-hammers were almost in a state of
requisition. In the beginning, it was a contest who should first aim a blow at
the nose of the Virgin Mary, or break the leg of her son. In one day, contracts
were entered into with masons for defacing images which for centuries, had been
partly concealed under the dusty webs of generations of spiders.</p>
<p>As for the statues within reach of swords and pikes, it was a continual
scene of amusement to the licentious to knock off the ear of one angel, and
scratch the face of another. Not an epitaph was left to retrace the patriotic
deeds of an upright statesman, or the more brilliant exploits of a heroic
warrior; not a memento, to record conjugal affection, filial piety, or grateful
friendship. The iconoclasts proceeded not with the impetuous fury of fanatics,
but with the extravagant foolery of atheistical buffoons.</p>
<p>All the gold and silver ornaments disappeared: a great part of them were
dissolved in the crucibles of the mint, after having been presented as a homage
to the Convention, some of whose members danced the <i>carmagnole</i> with
those who presented them at their bar, loaded on the back of mules and asses,
bedecked with all the emblems of catholic worship; while several of the rubies,
emeralds, &amp;c. which had formerly decorated the glory, beaming round the
head of a Christ, were afterwards seen glittering on the finger of the
revolutionary committee-men.</p>
<p>Chaumette, an attorney, was the man who proclaimed atheism, and his example
had many imitators. It seemed the wish of that impious being to exile God
himself from nature. He it was who imagined those orgies, termed the festivals
of reason. One of the most remarkable of these festivals was celebrated in this
very church of <i>St. Eustache</i>.</p>
<p>Although Mademoiselle Maillard, the singing heroine of the French opera,
figured more than once as the goddess of reason, that divinity was generally
personified by some shameless female, who, if not a notorious prostitute, was
frequently little better. Her throne occupied the place of the altar; her
supporters were chiefly drunken soldiers, smoking their pipe; and before her,
were a set of half-naked vagabonds, singing and dancing the
<i>carmagnole</i>.</p>
<p>"In this church," says an eye-witness, "the interior of the choir
represented a landscape, decorated with cottages and clumps of trees. In the
distance were mysterious bowers, to which narrow paths led, through declivities
formed of masses of artificial rock.</p>
<p>"The inside of the church presented the spectacle of a large public-house.
Round the choir were arranged tables, loaded with bottles, sausages, pies,
pâtés, and other viands. On the altars of the lateral chapels, sacrifices were
made to luxury and gluttony; and the consecrated stones bore the disgusting
marks of beastly intemperance.</p>
<p>"Guests crowded in at all doors: whoever came partook of this festival:
children thrust their hands into the dishes, and helped themselves out of the
bottles, as a sign of liberty; while the speedy consequences of this freedom
became a matter of amusement to grown persons in a similar state of ebriety.
What a deplorable picture of the people, who blindly obeyed the will of a few
factious leaders!</p>
<p>"In other churches, balls were given; and, by way of shutting the door in
the face of modesty, these were continued during the night, in order that,
amidst the confusion of nocturnal revelry, those desires which had been kindled
during the day, might be freely gratified under the veil of darkness.</p>
<p>"The processions which accompanied these orgies, were no less attended with
every species of atheistical frenzy. After feasting their eyes with the
sacrifice of human victims, the Jacobin faction, or their satellites, followed
the car of their impure goddess: next came, in another car, a moving orchestra,
composed of blind musicians, a too faithful image of that Reason which was the
object of their adoration."</p>
<p>The state of France, at that period, proves that religion being detached
from social order, there remained a frightful void, Which nothing could have
filled up but its subsequent restoration. Without religion, men become enemies
to each other, criminals by principle, and bold violators of the laws; force is
the only curb that can restrain them. The inevitable consequence is, that
anarchy and rapine desolate the face of the earth, and reduce it to a heap of
misfortune and ruin.</p>
<h2><a name="let24">LETTER XXIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 27, 1801.</i></p>
<p>When we travel back in idea for the last ten years, and pass in review the
internal commotions which have distracted France during that period, and the
external struggle she has had to maintain for the security of her independence,
we cannot refuse our admiration to the constancy which the French have
manifested in forming institutions for the diffusion of knowledge, and
repositories of objects tending to the advancement of the arts and sciences. In
this respect, if we except the blood-thirsty reign of Robespierre, no clash of
political interests, no change in the form or administration of the government,
has relaxed their ardour, or slackened their perseverance. Whatever set of men
have been in power, the arts and sciences have experienced almost uninterrupted
protection.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the French themselves, the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES, in the
CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, may claim pre-eminence over every other repository
of sculpture; but many persons may, probably, feel a satisfaction more pure and
unadulterated in viewing the</p>
<p class="center">MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS.</p>
<p>Here, neither do insignia of triumph call to mind the afflicting scenes of
war, nor do emblems of conquest strike the eye of the travelled visiter, and
damp his enjoyment by blending with it bitter recollections. Vandalism is the
only enemy from whose attacks the monuments, here assembled, have been
rescued.</p>
<p>This Museum, which has, in fact, been formed out of the wrecks of the
revolutionary storm, merits particular attention. Although it was not open to
the public, for the first time, till the 15th of Fructidor, year III (2nd of
September 1795), its origin may be dated from 1790, when the Constituent
Assembly, having decreed the possessions of the Clergy to be national property,
charged the <i>Committee of Alienation</i> to exert their vigilance for the
preservation of all the monuments of the arts, spread throughout the wide
extent of the ecclesiastical domains.</p>
<p>The philanthropic LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, (the last Duke of the family), as
President of that committee, fixed on a number of artists and literati to
select such monuments as the committee were anxious to preserve. The
municipality of Paris, being specially entrusted, by the National Assembly,
with the execution of this decree, also nominated several literati and artists
of acknowledged merit to co-operate with the former in their researches and
labours. Of this association was formed a commission, called <i>Commission des
Monumens</i>. From that epoch, proper places were sought for the reception of
the treasures which it was wished to save from destruction. The <i>Committee of
Alienation</i> appointed the <i>ci-devant</i> monastery of the <i>Petits
Augustins</i> for the monuments of sculpture and pictures, and those of the
<i>Capucins, Grands Jesuites,</i> and <i>Cordeliers</i>, for the books and
manuscripts.</p>
<p>By these means, the monuments in the suppressed convents and churches were,
by degrees, collected in this monastery, which is situated in the <i>Rue des
Petits Augustins</i>, so named after that order of monks, whose church here was
founded, in 1613, by Marguerite de Valois, first wife of Henry IV.</p>
<p>At the same period, ALEXANDRE LENOIR was appointed, by the Constituent
Assembly, director of this establishment. As I shall have frequent occasion to
mention the name of that estimable artist, I shall here content myself with
observing, that the choice did honour to their judgment.</p>
<p>In the mean time, under pretext of destroying every emblem of feudality, the
most celebrated master-pieces were consigned to ruin; but the commission
before-mentioned opportunely published instructions respecting the means of
preserving the valuable articles which they purposed to assemble.</p>
<p>The National Convention also gave indisputable proof of its regard for the
arts, by issuing several decrees in their favour. Its <i>Committee of Public
Instruction</i> created a commission, composed of distinguished literati and
artists of every class, for the purpose of keeping a watchful eye over the
preservation of the monuments of the arts. The considerable number of memoirs,
reports, and addresses, diffused through the departments by this learned and
scientific association, enlightened the people, and arrested the arm of those
modern Vandals who took a pleasure in mutilating the most admired statues,
tearing or defacing the most valuable pictures, and melting casts of bronze of
the most exquisite beauty.</p>
<p>Among the numerous reports to which these acts of blind ignorance gave
birth, three published by GRÉGOIRE, ex-bishop of Blois, claim particular
distinction no less on account of the taste and zeal which they exhibit for the
advancement of literature and the fine arts, than for the invective with which
they abound against the madness of irreligious barbarism. This last stroke,
aptly applied, was the means of recovering many articles of value, and of
preserving the monuments still remaining in the provinces.</p>
<p>In these eventful times, LENOIR, the Conservator of the rising museum,
collected, through his own indefatigable exertions, a considerable number of
mausolea, statues, bas-reliefs, and busts of every age and description. No
sooner did a moment of tranquillity appear to be reestablished in this country,
than he proposed to the government to place all these monuments in historical
and chronological order, by classing them, according to the age in which they
had been executed, in particular halls or apartments, and giving to each of
these apartments the precise character peculiar to each century. This plan
which, in its aggregate, united the history of the art and that of France, by
means of her monuments, met with general approbation, and was accordingly
adopted by the members of the government.</p>
<p>Thus, throughout this Museum, the architectural decorations of the different
apartments are of the age to which the monuments of Sculpture, contained in
each, belongs; and the light penetrates through windows of stained glass, from
the designs of RAPHAEL, PRIMATICCIO, ALBERT DURER, LE SUEUR, &amp;c., the
production of the particular century corresponding to that of the
sculpture.</p>
<p>Come then, let us visit this Museum, and endeavour to discriminate the
objects which may be most interesting both to the artist and historian. We
first enter the</p>
<p class="center">ANTI-CHAMBER.</p>
<p>This apartment presents itself to our inquisitive looks, as a Hall of
Introduction, which may not be unaptly compared to the preface of a grand work.
Here we behold a crowd of monuments, arranged methodically, so as to prepare
our eyes for tracing the different ages through which we have to travel.</p>
<p>We first remark those altars, worn by the hand of Time, on which the trading
Gauls of the ancient <i>Lutetia</i>, now Paris, sacrificed to the gods in the
time of Tiberius. Jupiter, Mars, Vulcan, Mercury, Venus, Pan, Castor and
Pollux, and the religious ceremonies here sculptured, are sufficient to attest
that the Parisians were then idolaters, and followed the religion of the
Romans, to whom they were become tributary. The Inscriptions on each of these
monuments, which are five in number, leave no doubt as to their authenticity,
and the epoch of their erection.</p>
<p>These altars, five in number, are charged with bas-reliefs, and the first of
them is inscribed with the following words in Latin.</p>
<p class="bq">
TIB. CAESARE.<br />
AVG. IOVI OPTVMO<br />
MAXSVMO (<i>aram</i>) M.<br />
NAVTAE. PARISIACI<br />
PUBLICE POSIERVNT.<br /></p>
<p><i>Tiberius Cæsar, having accepted or taken the name of Augustus, the
navigators (Nautæ) belonging to the city of Paris, publicly consecrated this
altar to Jupiter the most great and most good.</i></p>
<p>In 1711, these monuments were dug up from the choir of the cathedral of
<i>Notre-Dame</i>, out of the foundations of the ancient church of Paris,
constructed by Childebert, on the ruins of a temple, formerly dedicated to
Isis, which he caused to be demolished. Near them we see the great goddess of
the Germans figure under the name of Nehalennia, in honour of whom that people
had erected a great number of monuments, some of which were discovered in the
year 1646, when the sea retired from the island of Walcheren.</p>
<p>Capitals, charged with bas-reliefs, taken from a subterraneous basilic,
built by Pepin, have likewise been collected, and follow those which I have
just mentioned. Next comes the tomb of CLOVIS, which exhibits that prince lying
at length; he is humbling himself before the Almighty, and seems to be asking
him forgiveness for his crimes. We likewise see those of CHILDEBERT and of the
cruel CHILPERIC. The intaglio, relieved by inlaid pieces of Mosaic, of queen
FREDEGOND, has escaped the accidents of twelve centuries. Just Heaven! what
powers have disappeared from the face of the earth since that period! And to
what reflections does not this image, still existing of that impious woman,
give birth in the mind of the philosopher! CHARLEMAGNE, who was buried at
Aix-la-Chapelle, seated on a throne of gold, appears here, in a haughty
attitude, with his sword in his hand, still to be giving laws to the world!</p>
<p>As might naturally be supposed, most of these figures have suffered much by
the rude attacks of Time; but in spite of his indelible impression, the
unpolished hand of the sculptor is still distinguishable, and betrays the
degraded state of the arts during the darkness of the middle ages. Let us pass
into the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p>Here we shall remark arches in the Gothic style, supported by thick pillars,
according to the architecture.of that period. Ornaments, in the form of
<i>culs-de-lampe</i>, terminate the centre of the arches, which are painted in
azure-blue, and charged with stars. When temples were begun to be sheltered or
covered, nations painted the inside of the roof in this manner, in order to
keep in view the image of the celestial canopy to which they directed all their
affections, and to preserve the memory of the ancient custom of offering up
sacrifices to the divinity in the open air.</p>
<p>Here the statue of LEWIS IX, surnamed the Saint, is placed near that of
PHILIP, one of his sons, and of CHARLES, his brother, king of Sicily, branded
in history, by having, through his oppression, driven his subjects into revolt,
and caused the massacre of the French in that island in 1277; a massacre well
known by the name of the <i>Sicilian vespers</i>.</p>
<p>It seems that it was the fashion, in those days, for kings themselves to be
bearers at funerals. We are told by St. Foix, that the body of LEWIS, another
son of the Saint, who died in 1662, aged 26, and whose cenotaph is here, was
first carried to St. Denis, and thence to the abbey of Royaumont, where it was
interred. "The greatest lords of the kingdom," says he, "alternately bore the
coffin on their shoulders, and Henry III; king of England, carried it himself
for a considerable time, as feudatory of the crown."</p>
<p>PHILIP III, too, above-mentioned, having brought to Paris the remains of his
father from Tunis in Africa, carried them barefooted, on his shoulders, to St.
Denis. Wherever he rested by the way, towers were erected in commemoration of
this act of filial piety; but these have been destroyed since the
revolution.</p>
<p>The casements of this hall, in the form of ogives, are ornamented with
stained glass of the first epoch of the invention of that art. We now come to
the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p>This hall shews us the light, yet splendid architecture of the Arabs,
introduced into France in consequence of the Crusades. Here are the statues of
the kings that successively appeared in this age down to king JOHN, who was
taken prisoner by Edward, the black prince, at the battle of Poietiers. They
are clad after the manner of their time, and lying at length on a stylobate,
strewn with flower-de-luces. Twenty-two knights, each mounted on lions, armed
cap-à-pié, represented of the natural size, and coloured, fill ogive niches
ornamented with Mosaic designs, relieved with gold, red, and blue.</p>
<p>The tombs of CHARLES V, surnamed the <i>Wise</i>, and of the worthy
constable, DU GUESCLIN, together with that of SANCERRE, his faithful friend,
rise in the middle of this apartment; which presents to the eye all the
magnificence of a Turkish mosque. After having quitted it, what a striking
contrast do we not remark on entering the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY!</p>
<p>Columns, arabesque ceilings charged with gilding, light pieces of sculpture
applied on blue and violet grounds, imitating cameo, china, or enamel; every
thing excites astonishment, and concurs in calling to mind the first epoch of
the regeneration of the arts in this country.</p>
<p>The ideas of the amateur are enlivened in this brilliant apartment: they
prepare him for the gratification which he is going to experience at the sight
of the beautiful monuments produced by the age, so renowned of Francis I.
There, architecture predominates over sculpture; here, sculpture over
architecture.</p>
<p>The genius of RAPHAEL paved the way to this impulse of regeneration: he had
recently produced the decorations of the Vatican; and the admirable effect of
these master-pieces of art, kindled an enthusiasm in the mind of the artists,
who travelled. On their return to France, they endeavoured to imitate them: in
this attempt, JEAN JUSTE, a sculptor sent to Rome, at the expense of the
Cardinal D'AMBOISE, was the most succcessful.</p>
<p>First, we behold the mausoleum of LOUIS D'ORLÉANS, victim of the faction of
the Duke of Burgundy, and that of his brother CHARLES, the poet. Near them is
that of VALENTINE DE MILAN, the inconsolable wife of the former, who died
through grief the year after she lost her husband. As an emblem of her
affliction, she took for her device a watering-pot stooped, whence drops kept
trickling in the form of tears. Let it not be imagined, however, that it was on
account of his constancy that this affectionate woman thus bewailed him till
she fell a victim to her sorrow.</p>
<p>LOUIS D'ORLÉANS was a great seducer of ladies of the court, and of the
highest rank too, says Brantome. Indeed, historians concur in stating that to a
brilliant understanding, he joined the most captivating person. We accordingly
find that the Dutchess of Burgundy and several others were by no means cruel to
him; and he had been supping tête-à-tête with Queen Isabeau de Bavière, when,
in returning home, he was assassinated on the twenty-third of November 1407.
His amorous intrigues at last proved fatal to the English, as you will learn
from the following story, related by the same author.</p>
<p>One morning, M. d'Orléans having in bed with him a woman of quality, whose
husband came to pay him an early visit, he concealed the lady's head, while he
exhibited the rest of her person to the contemplation of the unsuspecting
intruder, at the same time forbidding him, as he valued his life, to remove the
sheet from her face. Now, the cream of the jest was, that, on the following
night, the good soul of a husband, as he lay beside his dear, boasted to her
that the Duke of Orleans had shewn him the most beautiful woman that he had
ever seen: but that for her face he could not tell what to say of it, as it was
concealed under the sheet. "From this little intrigue," adds Brantome, "sprang
that brave and valiant bastard of Orleans, Count Dunois, the pillar of France,
and the scourge of the English."</p>
<p>Here we see the statues of CHARLES VI, and of JANE of Burgundy. The former
being struck by a <i>coup de soleil</i>, became deranged in his intellects and
imbecile, after having displayed great genius; he is represented with a pack of
cards in his hand to denote that they were first invented for that prince's
diversion. The latter was Dutchess of BEAUFORT, wife to the Duke, who commanded
the English army against Charles VII, and as brother to our Henry IV, was
appointed regent of France, during the minority of his nephew, Henry V.</p>
<p>Next come those of RÉNÉE D'ORLÉANS, grand-daughter of the intrepid Dunois;
and of PHILIPPE DE COMMINES, celebrated by his memoirs of the tyrant, LEWIS XI,
whose statue faces that of CHARLES VII, his father.</p>
<p>The image of JOAN OF ARC, whom that king had the baseness to suffer to
perish, after she had maintained him on the throne, also figures in this hall
with that of ISABEAU DE BAVIÈRE. The shameful death of the Maid of Orleans,
who, as every one knows, was, at the instigation of the English, condemned as a
witch, and burnt alive at Rouen on the 30th of May 1430, must inspire with
indignation every honest Englishman who reflects on this event, which will ever
be a blot in the page of our history. Isabeau affords a striking example of the
influence of a queen's morals on the affections of the people. On her first
arrival in Paris, she was crowned by angels, and received from the burghers the
most magnificent and costly presents. At her death, she was so detested by the
nation, that in order to convey her body privately to St. Denis, it was
embarked in a little skiff at <i>Port-Landri</i>, with directions to the
waterman to deliver it to the abbot.</p>
<p>The superb tomb of LEWIS XII, placed in the middle of this apartment,
displays great magnificence; and his statue, lying at length, which represents
him in a state of death, recalls to mind that moment so grievous to the French
people, who exclaimed, in following his funeral procession to St. Denis, "Our
good king Lewis XII is dead, and we have lost our father."</p>
<p>The historian delights to record a noble trait of that prince's character.
Lewis XII had been taken prisoner at the battle of St. Aubin by Louis de la
Trimouille, who, fearing the resentment of the new king, and wishing to excuse
himself for his conduct, received this magnanimous reply: "It is not for the
king of France to revenge the quarrels of the duke of Orleans."</p>
<p>The statue of PIERRE DE NAVARRE, son of Charles the <i>Bad</i>, seems placed
here to form in the mind of the spectator a contrast between his father and
Lewis XII. The tragical end of Charles is of a nature to fix attention, and
affords an excellent subject for a pencil like that of Fuseli.</p>
<p>Charles the <i>Bad</i>, having fallen into such a state of decay that he
could not make use of his limbs, consulted his physician, who ordered him to be
wrapped up from head to foot, in a linen cloth impregnated with brandy, so that
he might be inclosed in it to the very neck as in a sack. It was night when
this remedy was administered. One of the female attendants of the palace,
charged to sew up the cloth that contained the patient, having come to the
neck, the fixed point where she was to finish her seam, made a knot according
to custom; but as there was still remaining an end of thread, instead of
cutting it as usual with scissars, she had recourse to the candle, which
immediately set fire to the whole cloth. Being terrified, she ran away, and
abandoned the king, who was thus burnt alive in his own palace.</p>
<p>What a picture for the moralist is this assemblage of persons, celebrated
either for their errors, crimes, talents, or virtues!</p>
<h2><a name="let25">LETTER XXV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, November 28, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>Conceiving how interested you (who are not only a connoisseur, but an
F.A.S.) must feel in contemplating the only repository in the world, I believe,
which contains such a chronological history of the art of sculpture, I lose no
time in conducting you to complete our survey of the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS
in the <i>Rue des Petits Augustins</i>.</p>
<p>Having examined those of the fifteenth century, during our former visit, we
are at length arrived at the age of the Fine Arts in France, and now enter
the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p class="bq">
"But see! each muse in LEO'S golden days,<br />
Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays;<br />
Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,<br />
Shakes off the dust, and rears his reverend head;<br />
Then Sculpture and her sister arts revive,<br />
Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live."<br />
</p>
<p>These beautiful lines of Pope immediately occur to the mind, on considering
that, in Italy, the Great LEO, by the encouragement which he gave to men of
talents, had considerably increased the number of master-pieces; when the taste
for the Fine Arts, after their previous revival by the Medici, having spread
throughout that country, began to dawn in France about the end of the fifteenth
century. By progressive steps, the efforts made by the French artists to
emulate their masters, attained, towards the middle of the sixteenth century, a
perfection which has since fixed the attention of Europe.</p>
<p>On entering this hall, which is consecrated to that period, the amateur
finds his genius inflamed. What a deep impression does not the perfection of
the numerous monuments which it has produced make on his imagination! First, he
admires the beautiful tomb erected to the memory of FRANCIS I, the restorer of
literature and the arts; who, by inviting to his court LEONARDO DA VINCI and
PRIMATICCIO, and establishing schools and manufactories, consolidated the great
work of their regeneration.</p>
<p>"Curse the monks!" exclaimed I, on surveying this magnificent monument,
constructed in 1550, from the designs of the celebrated PHILIBERT DE L'ORME.
"Who cannot but regret," continued I to myself, "that so gallant a knight as
Francis I. should fall a victim to that baneful disease which strikes at the
very sources of generation? Who cannot but feel indignant that so generous a
prince, whose first maxim was, that <i>true magnanimity consisted in the
forgiveness of injuries, and pusillanimity in the prosecution of revenge</i>,
should owe his death to the diabolical machinations of a filthy friar?" Yet, so
it was; the circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Francis I. was smitten by the charms of the wife of one Lunel, a dealer in
iron. A Spanish chaplain, belonging to the army of the Emperor Charles V,
passing through Paris in order to repair to Flayers, threw himself in this
man's way, and worked on his mind till he had made him a complete fanatic:
"Your king," said the friar, "protects Lutheranism in Germany, and will soon
introduce it into France. Be revenged on him and your wife, by serving
religion. Communicate to him that disease for which no certain remedy is yet
known."&mdash;"And how am I to give it to him?" replied Lunel; "neither I nor
my wife have it."&mdash;"But I have," rejoined the monk: "I hold up my hand and
swear it. Introduce me only for one half-hour by night, into your place, by the
side of your faithless fair, and I will answer for the rest."</p>
<p>The priest having prevailed on Lunel to consent to his scheme, went to a
place where he was sure to catch the infection, and, by means of Lunel's wife,
he communicated it to the king. Being previously in possession of a secret
remedy, the monk cured himself in a short time; the poor woman died at the
expiration of a month; and Francis I, after having languished for three or four
years, at length, in 1547, sunk under the weight of a disorder then generally
considered as incurable.</p>
<p>The tomb of the VALOIS, erected in honour of that family, by Catherine de
Medicis, soon after the death of Henry II, is one of the masterpieces of
GERMAIN PILON. In the execution of this beautiful monument, that famous artist
has found means to combine the correctness of style of Michael Angelo with the
grace of Primaticcio. To the countenance of HENRY and CATHERINE, who are
represented in a state of death, lying as on a bed, he has imparted an
expression of sensibility truly affecting.</p>
<p>Next comes the tomb of DIANE DE POITIERS, that celebrated beauty, who
displayed equal judgment in the management of State affairs and in the delicacy
of her attachments; who at the age of 40, captivated king Henry II, when only
18; and, who, though near 60 at the death of that prince, had never ceased to
preserve the same empire over his heart. At the age of fourteen, she was
married to Louis de Brézé, grand seneschal of Normandy, and died in April 1506,
aged 66.</p>
<p>Brantome, who saw her not long before her death, when she had just recovered
from the confinement of a broken leg, and had experienced troubles sufficient
to lessen her charms, thus expresses himself: "Six months ago, when I met her,
she was still so beautiful that I know not any heart of adamant which would not
have been moved at the sight of her."&mdash;To give you a perfect idea of her
person, take this laconic description, which is not one of fancy, but collected
from the best historians.</p>
<p>Her jet black hair formed a striking contrast to her lily complexion. On her
cheeks faintly blushed the budding rose. Her teeth vied with ivory itself in
whiteness: in a word, her form was as elegant as her deportment was
graceful.</p>
<p>By way of lesson to the belles of the present day, let them be told that
DIANE DE POITIERS was never ill, nor affected indisposition. In the severity of
the winter, she daily washed her face with spring-water, and never had recourse
to cosmetics.----"What pity," says Brantome, "that earth should cover so
beautiful a woman!"</p>
<p>No man, indeed, who sympathizes with the foibles of human nature, can
contemplate the tomb of DIANE DE POITIERS, and reflect on her numerous virtues
and attractions, without adopting the sentiments of Brantome, and feeling his
breast glow with admiration.</p>
<p>This extraordinary woman afforded the most signal protection to literati and
men of genius, and was, in fact, no less distinguished for the qualities of her
heart than for the beauty of her person. "She was extremely good-humoured,
charitable, and humane," continues Brantome "The people of France ought to pray
to God that the female favourite of every chief magistrate of their country may
resemble this amiable frail one."</p>
<p>As a proof of the elevation of her sentiments, I shall conclude by quoting
to you the spirited reply DIANE made to Henry II, who, by dint of royal
authority, wished to legitimate a daughter he had by her: "I am of a birth,"
said she, "to have had lawful children by you. I have been your mistress,
because I loved you. I will never suffer a decree to declare me your
concubine."</p>
<p>The beautiful group of the modest Graces, and that representing Diana,
accompanied by her dogs Procion and Syrius, sculptured by Jean Gougeon, to
serve as the decoration of a fountain in the park of DIANE DE POITIERS at Anet,
attracts the attention of the connoisseur.</p>
<p>The tomb of GOUGEON, composed of his own works, and erected to the memory of
that great artist, through gratitude, is, undoubtedly, a homage which he justly
deserved. This French Phidias was a Calvinist, and one of the numerous victims
of St. Bartholomew's day, being shot on his scaffold, as he was at work on the
<i>Louvre</i>, the 24th of August 1572. Here too we behold the statues of
BIRAGUE and of the GONDI, those atrocious wretches who, together with Catherine
de Medicis, plotted that infamous massacre; while CHARLES IX, no less criminal,
here exhibits on his features the stings of a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>The man that has a taste for learning, gladly turns his eye from this horde
of miscreants, to fix it on the statue of CLAUDE-CATHERINE DE
CLERMONT-TONNERRE, who was so conversant in the dead languages as to bear away
the palm from Birague and Chiveray, in a speech which she composed and spoke
in Latin, at twenty-four hours' notice, in answer to the ambassadors who
tendered the crown of Poland to Charles IX.</p>
<p>If the friend of the arts examine the beautiful portico erected by Philibert
de l'Orme, on the banks of the Eure, for Diane de Poitiers, composed of the
three orders of architecture, placed the one above the other, and forming
altogether an elevation of sixty feet, he will be amazed to learn that this
superb monument constructed at Anet, twenty leagues distant from Paris, was
removed thence, and re-established in this Museum, by the indefatigable
conservator, LENOIR.</p>
<p>On leaving the apartment containing the master-pieces brought to light by
Francis I, the next we reach is the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p>What a crowd of celebrated men contained in the temple consecrated to
virtue, courage, and talents!</p>
<p>There, I behold TURENNE, CONDÉ, MONTAUSIER, COLBERT, MOLIÈRE, CORNEILLE, LA
FONTAINE, RACINE, FÉNÉLON, and BOILEAU. The great LEWIS XIV, placed in the
middle of this hall, seems to become still greater near those immortal
geniuses.</p>
<p>Farther on, we see the statue of the implacable RICHELIEU, represented
expiring in the arms of Religion, while Science is weeping at his feet. Ye
Gods! what a prostitution of talent! This is the master-piece of GIRARDON; but,
in point of execution, many connoisseurs prefer the mausoleum of the crafty
MAZARIN, whom COYZEVOX has pourtrayed in a supplicating posture.</p>
<p>LEWIS XIII, surnamed the <i>Just</i>, less great than his illustrious
subject, DE THOU, casts down his eyes in the presence of his ministers.</p>
<p>The mausolea of LE BRUN, LULLI, and JÉROME BIGNON, the honour, the love, and
the example of his age, terminate the series of monuments of that epoch, still
more remarkable for its literati than its artists. We at last come to the</p>
<p class="center">HALL OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<p>Here we admire the statues of MONTESQUIEU, FONTENELLE, VOLTAIRE, ROUSSEAU,
HELVÉTIUS, CRÉBILLON, PIRON, &amp;c. &amp;c. The tombs of the learned
MAUPERTUIS and CAYLUS, and also that of Marshal D'HARCOURT, give a perfect idea
of the state of degradation into which the art of design had fallen at the
beginning of this century; but the new productions which decorate the extremity
of this spacious hall are sufficient to prove to what degree the absolute will
of a great genius can influence the progress of the arts, as well as of the
sciences. VIEN and DAVID appeared, and the art was regenerated.</p>
<p>Here, too, we find a statue, as large as life, representing Christ leaning
on a pillar, executed  by MICHAEL ANGELO STODTZ. I notice this statue merely to
observe, that the original, from which it is taken, is to be seen at Rome, in
the <i>Chiesa della Minerva</i> where it is held in such extraordinary
veneration, that the great toe-nail of the right foot having been entirely worn
away by the repeated kisses of the faithful, one of silver had been
substituted. At length this second nail having been likewise worn away, a third
was placed, of copper, which is already somewhat worn. It was sculptured by
MICHAEL ANGELO BUONAROTI.</p>
<p>We experience an emotion of regret at the aspect of the handsome monument by
MICHALLON, on learning that it was erected to the memory of young DROUAIS, a
skilful and amiable artist, stopped by death, in 1788, during his brilliant
career, at the early age of 24. He has left behind him three historical
pictures, which are so many master-pieces.</p>
<p>The beautiful statue of the youthful Cyparissus, by CHAUDET, the most
eminent French sculptor, reminds us of the full and elegant form of the fine
Greek Bacchus, which decorates the peristyle of the antichamber or Hall of
Introduction.</p>
<p>Thus the amateur and the student will find, in this Museum, an uninterrupted
chronology of monuments, both antique and modern, beginning by those of ancient
Greece, whose date goes back to two thousand five hundred years before our era,
to examine those of the Romans, of the Lower Empire, of the Gauls, and thence
pass to the first epoch of the French monarchy, and at length follow all the
gradations through which the art has passed from its cradle to its decrepitude.
The whole of this grand establishment is terminated by a spacious garden, which
is converted into an</p>
<p class="center">ELYSIUM.</p>
<p>There, on a verdant lawn, amid firs, cypresses, poplars, and weeping
willows, repose the ashes of the illustrious poets, MOLIÈRE, LA FONTAINE,
BOILEAU, &amp;c.; of the learned DESCARTES, MABILLON, MONTFAUCON, &amp;c.,
inclosed in sarcophagi; there, they still receive the homage which mankind owe
to talents and virtue.</p>
<p>But hold! mark the sepulchre of the learned and tender HÉLOÏSE. Her remains,
though formerly conjoined to those of her lover, were subsequently separated,
and after a lapse of three hundred years, they are now reassembled.</p>
<p class="bq">
Here one kind grave unites their hapless name,<br />
And grafts her love immortal on his fame.<br />
</p>
<p>With a smile seated on her lips, HÉLOÏSE seems to be sighing for the object
of her glowing affection: while the unfortunate ABÉLARD, coldly reclined, is
still commenting on the Trinity. The <i>Paraclete</i>, having been sold and
demolished, LENOIR, with all the sensibility of an admirer of genius, withdrew
the bones of ABÉLARD and HÉLOÏSE from that monastery, and placed them here in a
sepulchral chapel, partly constructed from the remains of their ancient
habitation.</p>
<p>Such is the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS. When completed, for some valuable
specimens of the arts slill remain to be added, it will be one of the most
interesting establishments in Paris, and perhaps in Europe, especially if
considered in regard to the improvement of modern sculpture, and, I may add,
architecture. No building can be better adapted than a monastery for an
establishment of this nature. The solemn gloom of cloisters suits the temper of
the mind, when we reflect on the mortality incident to a succession of ages,
and the melancholy which it inspires, is in perfect unison with our feelings,
when we contemplate the sepulchral monuments that recall to our memory the
actions of the illustrious departed.</p>
<p>This Museum is very extensive, the three courts and large garden, which at
present compose the whole of its premises, occupying a space of three thousand
seven hundred and sixty-two toises. LENOIR, however, has recently presented to
the First Consul a plan for enlarging it, without any additional expense of
building, by adding to it the neighbouring <i>Hôtel de Bouillon</i>. He
proposes that there should be a new entrance by the quay, exhibiting a spacious
court, decorated with statues, erected in regular order; and that the
apartments on the ground-floor should be appropriated as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>To a collection of portraits of all the celebrated men of France.</li>
<li>To a chronological series of armour of all ages.</li>
<li>To a complete collection of French medals.</li>
<li>To a library, solely formed of the books necessary for obtaining a
knowledge of the monuments contained in this Museum.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I consider the mutilated state in which most of these monuments were
found at the first formation of this interesting establishment, and view the
perfection in which they now appear; when I remark the taste and judgment
displayed in the distribution and interior arrangement of the different
apartments of this rich museum; when I learn, from the printed documents on the
subject, the strict economy which has been observed in the acquisition or
restoration of a great number of monuments, the more valuable as they
illustrate the history of the arts; I confess that I find myself at a loss
which most to admire in the Conservator, his courage, zeal, perseverance, or
discrimination. Indeed, nothing but an assemblage of those qualities could have
overcome the difficulties and obstacles which he has surmounted.</p>
<p>I shall add that LENOIR'S obliging disposition and amenity of manners
equally entitle him to the gratitude and esteem of the connoisseur, the
student, or the inquisitive stranger.</p>
<h2><a name="let26">LETTER XXVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 1, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>I was highly gratified the other day on finding myself in company with some
of those men whom (to borrow Lord Thurlow's expression, in speaking of Warren
Hastings,) I have known only as I know Alexander, by the greatness of their
exploits; men whose names will be transmitted to posterity, and shine with
distinguished lustre in the military annals of France.</p>
<p>General A----y had already invited me to dine with him, in order to meet
General B----r; but, on the day fixed, the latter, as minister for the war
department, being under the necessity of entertaining Lord Cornwallis, the
party was postponed till the 8th of Frimaire, (20th of November), when, in
addition to General B----r, General A----y had assembled at his table several
men of note. Among others, were General M----rd, who commanded the right wing
of the army of Naples under Macdonald, in which he distinguished himself as a
brave soldier; and D----ttes, physician in chief to the army of the East. This
officer of health, as medical men are here denominated, is lately returned from
Egypt, where his skill and attention to his professional duties gained him
universal admiration.</p>
<p>In society so agreeable, time passed away rapidly till General B----r
arrived. It was late, that is about seven o'clock, though the invitation
expressed five precisely, as the hour of dinner. But, in Paris, a minister is
always supposed to be detained on official business of a nature paramount to
every other consideraton. On my being introduced to General B----r, he
immediately entered into conversation with me concerning Lord Cornwallis, whom
he had known in the American war, having served in the staff of Rochambeau at
the siege of Yorktown. As far back as that period B----r signalized himself by
his skill in military science. It was impossible to contemplate these
distinguished officers without calling to mind how greatly their country was
indebted to the exertion of their talents on various important occasions. These
recollections led me to admire that wisdom which had placed them in stations
for which they had proved themselves so eminently qualified. In England, places
are generally sought for men; in France, men are sought for places.</p>
<p>At seven, dinner was announced, and an excellent one it was, both in quality
and quantity. <i>Presto</i> was the word, and all the guests seemed habituated
to expedition. The difference between the duration of such a repast at this
day, and what it was before the revolution, shews how constantly men become the
slaves of fashion. Had BONAPARTE resembled Lucullus in being addicted to the
pleasures of the festive board, I make no doubt that it would have been the
height of <i>ton</i> to sit quietly two or three hours after dinner. But the
Chief Consul is said to be temperate, almost to abstemiousness; he rises from
table in less than half an hour; and that mode is now almost universal in
Paris, especially among the great men in office. Two elegant courses and a
desert were presently dispatched; the whole time employed in eating I know not
how many good dishes, and drinking a variety of choice wines, not exceeding
thirty-five minutes. At the end of the repast, coffee was presented to the
company in an adjoining room, after which the opera of <i>Tarare</i> was the
attraction of the evening.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned to you that General A----y had put into my hand
<i>L'Histoire du Canal du Midi</i>, written by himself.
<a name="let26fr1"></a>From a perusal of this interesting work, it appears that
one of his ancestors[<a href="#let26f1">1</a>] was the first who conceived the
idea of that canal, which was not only planned by him, but entirely completed
under his immediate direction. Having communicated his plan to Riquet, the
latter submited it to Colbert, and, on its being approved by Lewis XIV, became
<i>contractor</i> for all the works of that celebrated undertaking, which he
did not live to see finished. Riquet, however, not content with having derived
from the undertaking every advantage of honour and emolument, greedily snatched
from the original projector the meed of fame, so dearly earned by the
unremitting labour of thirty successive years. These facts are set forth in the
clearest light in the above-mentioned work, in which I was carefully examining
General A----y's plans for the improvement of this famous canal, when I was
most agreeably interrupted.</p>
<p>I had expressed to the General a wish to know the nature of the
establishment of which he is the director, at the same time apprizing him that
this wish did not extend to any thing that could not with propriety be made
public. He obligingly promised that I should be gratified, and this morning I
received ftom him a very friendly letter, accompanied by the following account
of the</p>
<p class="center">DÉPÔT DE LA GUERRE.</p>
<p>The general <i>Dépôt</i> or repository of maps and plans of war, &amp;c,
&amp;c, was established by LOUVOIS, in 1688. This was the celebrated period
when France, having attained the highest degree of splendour, secured her glory
by the results of an administration enlightened in all its branches.</p>
<p>At the beginning of its institution, the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i> was no
more than archives, where were collected, and preserved with order, the memoirs
of the generals, their correspondence, the accounts yet imperfect, and the
traces of anterior military operations.</p>
<p>The numerous resources afforded by this collection alone, the assistance and
advantages derived from it on every occasion, when it was necessary to
investigate a military system, or determine an important operation, suggested
the idea of assembling it under a form and classification more methodical.
Greater attention and exactness were exerted in enriching the <i>Dépôt</i> with
every thing that might complete the theoretical works and practical
elucidations of all the branches of the military art,</p>
<p>Marshal DE MAILLEBOIS, who was appointed director of this establishment in
1730, was one of the first authors of the present existing order. The
classification at first consisted only in forming registers of the
correspondence of the generals, according to date, distinguishing it by
<i>different wars</i>. It was divided into two parts, the former containing the
letters of the generals; and the latter, the minutes or originals of the
answers of the king and his ministers. To each volume was added a summary of
the contents, and, in regular succession, the journal of the military
operations of the year. These volumes, to the number of upwards of two thousand
seven hundred, contain documents from the eleventh century to the close of the
last American war; but the series is perfect only from the year 1631. This was
a valuable mine for a historiographer to explore; and, indeed, it is well known
that the <i>Memoirs of Turenne and of Condé</i>, the <i>History of the war of
1741</i>, and part of the fragments of the <i>Essay on the Manners and History
of Nations</i>, by Voltaire, were compiled and digested from the original
letters and memoirs preserved in the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i>.</p>
<p>Geographical engineers did not then exist as a corps. Topography was
practised by insulated officers, impelled thereto by the rather superficial
study of the mathematics and a taste for drawing; because it was for them a
mean of obtaining more advantageous employments in the staffs of the armies:
but the want of a central point, the difference of systems and methods, not
admitting of directing the operations to one same principle, as well as to one
same object, topography, little encouraged, was making but a slow progress,
when M. DE CHOISEUIL established, as a particular corps, the officers who had
applied themselves to the practice of that science. The <i>Dépôt</i> was
charged to direct and assemble the labours of the new corps. This authority
doubled the utility of the <i>Dépôt</i>: its results had the most powerful
influence during the war from 1757 to 1763.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General De VAULT, who had succeeded Marshal De MAILLEBOIS as
director of the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i>, conceived, and executed a plan,
destined to render still more familiar and secure the numerous documents
collected in this establishment. He first retrenched from the <i>Military
Correspondences and Memoirs</i> all tedious repetitions and unnecessary
details; he then classed the remainder under the head of a different army or
operation, without subjecting himself to any other order than a simple
chronology; but he caused each volume to be preceded by a very succinct,
historical summary, in order to enable the reader to seize the essence of the
original memoirs and documents, the text of which was faithfully copied in the
body of each volume, In this manner did he arrange all the military events from
the German war in 1677 to the peace of 1763. This analysis forms one hundred
and twenty five volumes.</p>
<p>It is easy to conceive how much more interesting these historical volumes
became by the addition, which took place about the same epoch, of the labours
of the geographical engineers employed in the armies. The military men having
it at the same time in his power to follow the combinations of the generals
with the execution of their plans, imbibes, without difficulty, the principles
followed by great captains, or improves himself from the exact account of the
errors and faults which it is so natural to commit on critical occasions.</p>
<p>When all the establishments of the old <i>régime</i> were tottering, or
threatened by the revolutionary storm, measures were suggested for preserving
the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i>, and, towards the end of 1791, it was transferred
from Versailles to Paris. Presently the new system of government, the war
declared against the emperor, and the foreseen conflagration of Europe,
concurred to give a new importance to this establishment. Alone, amidst the
general overthrow, it had preserved a valuable collection of the military and
topographical labours of the monarchy, of manuscripts of the greatest
importance, and a body of information of every kind respecting the resources,
and the country, of the powers already hostile, or on the point of becoming so.
<a name="let26fr2"></a>All the utility which might result from the <i>Dépôt</i>
was then felt, and it was thought necessary to give it a new
organization.[<a href="#let26f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>The <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i>, however, would have attained but imperfectly
the object of its institution, had there not been added to its topographical
treasure, the richest, as well as the finest, collection in Europe of every
geographical work held in any estimation. The first epochs of the revolution
greatly facilitated the increase of its riches of that description. The general
impulse, imprinted on the mind of the French nation, prompted every will
towards useful sacrifices. Private cabinets in possession of the scarcest maps,
gave them up to the government, <a name="let26fr3"></a>The suppression of the
monasteries and abbeys caused to flow to the centre the geographical riches
which they preserved in an obscurity hurtful to the progress of that important
science: and thus the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i> obtained one of the richest
collections in Europe.[<a href="#let26f3">3</a>] The government, besides,
completed it by the delivery of the great map of France by CASSINI, begun in
1750, together with all the materials forming the elements of that grand work.
<a name="let26fr4"></a>It is painful to add that not long before that period
(in 1791) the corps of geographical engineers, which alone could give utility
to such valuable materials had been suppressed.[<a href="#let26f4">4</a>]</p>
<p>In the mean time, the sudden changes in the administrative system had
dispersed the learned societies employed in astronomy, or the mathematical
sciences. The <i>National Observatory</i> was disused. The celebrated
astronomers attached to it had no rallying point: they could not devote
themselves to their labours but amidst the greatest difficulties; the salary
allowed to them was not paid; the numerous observations, continued for two
centuries, were on the point of being interrupted.</p>
<p>The <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i> then became the asylum of those estimable men.
This establishment excited and obtained the reverification of the measure of an
arc of the meridian, in order to serve as a basis for the uniformity of the
weights and measures which the government wished to establish.</p>
<p>MÉCHAIN, DELAMBRE, NOUET, TRANCHOT, and PERNY were dispatched to different
places from Barcelona to Dunkirk. After having established at each extremity of
this line a base, measured with the greatest exactness, they were afterwards to
advance their triangles, in order to ascend to the middle point of the line.
This operation, which has served for rectifying a few errors that the want of
perfection in the instruments had occasioned to be introduced into the measure
of the meridian of CASSINI, may be reckoned one of the most celebrated works
which have distinguished the close of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The establishment of the system of administration conformably to the
constitution of the year III (1795) separated the various elements which the
<i>Dépôt de la guerre</i> had found means to preserve. The <i>Board of
Longitude</i> was established; the <i>National Institute</i> was formed to
supply the place of the <i>Academy of Sciences</i>, &amp;c. The <i>Dépôt de la
guerre</i> was restored solely to its ancient prerogatives.
<a name="let26fr5"></a>Two years before, it had been under the necessity of
forming new geographical engineers and it succeeded in carrying the number
sufficiently high to suffice for the wants of the fourteen armies which France
had afterwards on foot.[<a href="#let26f5">5</a>] These officers being employed
in the service of the staffs, no important work was undertaken. But, since the
18th of Brumaire, year VIII, (9th of November, 1799) the Consuls of the
Republic have bestowed particular attention on geographical and topographical
operations. The new limits of the French territory require that the map of it
should be continued; and the new political system, resulting from the general
pacification, renders necessary the exact knowledge of the states of the allies
of the Republic.</p>
<p>The <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i> forms various sections of geographers, who are
at present employed in constructing accurate maps of the four united
departments. Piedmont, Savoy, Helvetia, and the part of Italy comprised between
the Adige and the Adda. One section, in conjunction with the Bavarian
engineers, is constructing a topographical map of Bavaria: another section is
carrying into execution the military surveys, and other topographical labours,
ordered by General MOREAU for the purpose of forming a map of Suabia.</p>
<p>The <i>Dépôt</i> has just published an excellent map of the Tyrol, reduced
from that of PAYSAN, and to which have been added the observations made by
Chevaliers DUPAY and LA LUCERNE. It has caused to be resumed the continuation
of the superb map of the environs of Versailles, called <i>La carte des
chasses</i>, a master-piece of topography and execution in all the arts
relating to that science. Since the year V (1795), it has also formed a library
composed of upwards of eight thousand volumes or manuscripts, the most rare, as
well as the most esteemed, respecting every branch of the military art in
general.</p>
<p>Although, in the preceding account, General A----y, with that modesty which
is the characteristic of a superior mind, has been totally silent respecting
his own indefatigable exertions, I have learned from the best authority, that
France is soon likely to derive very considerable advantages from the activity
and talent introduced by him, as director, into every branch of the <i>Dépôt de
la guerre</i>, and of which he has afforded in his own person an illustrious
example.</p>
<p>In giving an impulse to the interior labours of the <i>Dépôt</i>, the sole
object of General A----y is to make this establishment lose its
<i>paralyzing</i> destination of archives, in which, from time to time,
literati might come to collect information concerning some periods of national
or foreign history. He is of opinion that these materials ought to be drawn
from oblivion, and brought into action by those very persons who, having the
experience of war, are better enabled than any others to arrange its elements.
Instruction and method being the foundations of a good administration, of the
application of an art and of a science, as well as of their improvement, he has
conceived the idea of uniting in a classical work the exposition of the
knowledge necessary for the direction of the <i>Dépôt</i>, for geographical
engineers, staff-officers, military men in general, and historians.
<a name="let26fr6"></a>This, then, is the object of the <i>Mémomorial du Dépôt
de la guerre</i>, a periodical work, now in hand, which will become the guide
of every establishment of this nature[<a href="#let26f6">6</a>], by directing
with method the various labours used in the application of mathematical and
physical sciences to topography, and to that art which, of all others, has the
greatest influence on the destiny of empires: I mean the art military. The
improvements of which it is still susceptible will be pointed out in the
<i>Mémorial</i>, and every new idea proposed on the subject will there be
critically investigated.</p>
<p>In transcribing General A----y's sketch of this extremely-interesting
establishment, I cannot but reflect on the striking contrast that it presents,
in point of geographical riches, even half a century ago, to the disgraceful
poverty, in that line, which, about the same period, prevailed in England, and
was severely felt in the planning of our military expeditions.</p>
<p>I remember to have been told by the late Lord Howe, that, when he was
captain of the Magnanime at Plymouth, and was sent for express to London, in
the year 1757, in order to command the naval part of an expedition to the coast
of France, George II, and the whole cabinet council, seemed very much
astonished at his requiring the production of a map of that part of the enemy's
coast against which the expedition was intended. Neither in the apartment where
the council sat, nor in any adjoining one, was any such document; even in the
Admiralty-office no other than an indifferent map of the coast could be found:
as for the adjacent country, it was so little known in England, that, when the
British troops landed, their commander was ignorant of the distance of the
neighbouring villages.</p>
<p>Of late years, indeed, we have ordered these matters better; but, to judge
from circumstances, it should seem that we are still extremely deficient in
geographical and topographical knowledge; though we are not quite so ill
informed as in the time of a certain duke, who, when First Lord of the
Treasury, asked in what part of Germany was the Ohio?</p>
<p>P.S. In order to give you, at one view, a complete idea of the collections
of the <i>Dépôt de la guerre</i>, and of what they have furnished during the
war for the service of the government and of the armies, I shall end my letter
by stating that, independently of eight thousand chosen volumes, among which is
a valuable collection of atlases, of two thousand seven hundred volumes of old
archives, and of upwards of nine hundred <i>cartons</i> or pasteboard boxes of
modern original documents, the <i>Dépôt</i> possesses one hundred and
thirty-one volumes and seventy-eight <i>cartons</i> of descriptive memoirs,
composed at least of fifty memoirs each, four thousand seven hundred engraved
maps, of each of which there are from two to twenty-five copies, exclusively of
those printed at the <i>Dépôt</i>, and upwards of seven thousand four hundred
valuable manuscript maps, plans, or drawings of marches, battles, sieges,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>By order of the government, it has furnished, in the course of the war,
seven thousand two hundred and seventy-eight engraved maps, two hundred and
seven manuscript maps or plans, sixty-one atlases of various parts of the
globe, and upwards of six hundred descriptive memoirs.</p>

<h2><a name="let27">LETTER XXVII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 3, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>In this season, when the blasts of November have entirely stripped the trees
of their few remaining leaves, and Winter has assumed his hoary reign, the
garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>, loses much of the gaiety of its attractions.
Besides, to frequent that walk, at present, is like visiting daily one of our
theatres, you meet the same faces so often, that the scene soon becomes
monotonous. As well for the sake of variety as exercise, I therefore now and
then direct my steps along the</p>
<p class="center">BOULEVARDS.</p>
<p>This is the name given to the promenades with which Paris is, in part,
surrounded for an extent of six thousand and eighty-four toises.</p>
<p>They are distinguished by the names of the <i>Old</i> and the <i>New</i>.
The <i>Old</i>, or <i>North Boulevards</i>, commonly called the <i>Grands
Boulevards</i>, were begun in 1536, and, when faced with ditches, which were to
have been dug, they were intended to serve as fortifications against the
English who were ravaging Picardy, and threatening the capital. Thence,
probably, the etymology of their name; <i>Boulevard</i> signifying, as every
one knows, a bulwark.</p>
<p>However this may be, the extent of these <i>Old</i> Boulevards is two
thousand four hundred toises from the <i>Rue de la Concorde</i> to the <i>Place
de la Liberté</i>, formerly the site of the Bastille. They were first planted
in 1660, and are formed into three alleys by four rows of trees: the middle
alley is appropriated to carriages and persons on horseback, and the two
lateral ones are for foot-passengers.</p>
<p>Here, on each side, is assembled every thing that ingenuity can imagine for
the diversion of the idle stroller, or the recreation of the man of business.
Places of public entertainment, ambulating musicians, exhibitions of different
kinds, temples consecrated to love or pleasure, Vauxhalls, ball-rooms,
magnificent hotels, and other tasteful buildings, &amp;c. Even the
coffee-houses and taverns here have their shady bowers, and an agreeable
orchestra. Thus, you may always dine in Paris with a band of music to entertain
you, without additional expense.</p>
<p>The <i>New</i> Boulevards, situated to the south, were finished in 1761.
They are three thousand six hundred and eighty-three toises in extent from the
<i>Observatoire</i> to the <i>Hôtel des Invalides</i>. Although laid out much
in the same manner as the <i>Old</i>, there is little resemblance between them;
each having a very distinct appearance.</p>
<p>On the <i>New Boulevards</i>, the alleys are both longer and wider, and the
trees are likewise of better growth. There, the prospect is rural; and the air
pure; while cultivated fields, with growing corn, present themselves to the
eye. Towards the town, however, stand several pretty houses; little theatres
even were built, but did not succeed. This was not their latitude. But some
skittle-grounds and tea-gardens, lately opened, and provided with swings,
&amp;c. have attracted much company of a certain class in the summer.</p>
<p>In this quarter, you seldom meet with a carriage, scarcely ever with persons
sprucely dressed, but frequently with honest citizens, accompanied by their
whole family, as plain in their garb as in their manners. Lovers too with their
mistresses, who seek solitude, visit this retired walk; and now and then a poor
poet comes hither, not to sharpen his appetite, but to arrange his numbers.</p>
<p>Before, the revolution, the <i>Old</i> Boulevards, from the <i>Porte St.
Martin</i> to the <i>Théâtre Favart</i>, was the rendezvous of the
<i>élegantes</i>, who, on Sundays and Thursdays, used to parade there slowly,
backward and forward, in their carriages, as our belles do in Hyde Park; with
this difference, that, if their admirers did not accompany them, they generally
followed them to interchange significant glances, or indulge in amorous parley.
I understand that the summer lounge of the modern <i>élegantes</i> has, of late
years, been from the corner of the <i>Rue Grange Batelière</i> to that of the
<i>Rue Mont-Blanc</i>, where the ladies took their seats. This attracting the
<i>muscadins</i> in great numbers, not long since obtained for that part of the
Boulevard the appellation of <i>Petit Coblentz</i>.</p>
<p>Nearly about the middle of the North Boulevard stand two edifices, which owe
their erection to the vanity of Lewis XIV. In the gratification of that passion
did the <i>Grand Monarque</i> console himself for his numerous defeats and
disappointments; and the age in which he lived being fertile in great men,
owing, undoubtedly, to the encouragement he afforded them, his display of it
was well seconded by their superior talents. Previously to his reign, Paris had
several gates, but some of these being taken down, arcs of triumph, in
imitation of those of the Romans, were erected in their stead by <i>Louis le
Grand</i>, in commemoration of his exploits. And this too, at a time when the
allies might, in good earnest, have marched to Paris, had they not, by delay,
given Marshal Villars an opportunity of turning the tide of their victories on
the plain of Denain. Such was the origin of the</p>
<p class="center">PORTE SAINT DENIS.</p>
<p>The magnificence of its architecture classes it among the first public
monuments in Paris. It consists of a triumphal arch, insulated in the manner of
those of the ancients: it is seventy-two feet in diameter as well as in
elevation, and was executed in 1672, by BULLET from the designs of BLONDEL.</p>
<p>On each side of the principal entrance rise two sculptured pyramids, charged
with trophies of arms, both towards the faubourg, and towards the city.
Underneath each of these pyramids is a small collateral passage for persons on
foot. The arch is ornamented with two bas-reliefs: the one facing the city
represents the passage of the Rhine; and the other, the capture of
Maestricht.</p>
<p>On the frieze on both sides LUDOVICO MAGNO was formerly to be read, in large
characters of gilt bronze. This inscription is removed, and to it are
substituted the word <i>Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité</i>.</p>
<p>On arriving from Calais, you enter Paris by the <i>Porte St. Denis</i>. It
was also by the <i>Porte St. Denis</i> that kings and queens made their public
entry. On these occasions, the houses in all the streets through which they
passed, were decorated with silk hangings and tapestry, as far as the cathedral
of <i>Notre-Dame</i>. Scented waters perfumed  the air in the form of <i>jets
d'eau</i>; while wine and milk flowed from the different public fountains.</p>
<p>Froissard relates that, on the entrance of Isabeau de Bavière, there was in
the <i>Rue St. Denis</i> a representation of a clouded heaven, thickly sown
with stars, whence descended two angels who gently placed on her head a very
rich crown of gold, set with precious stones, at the same time singing verses
in her praise.</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that Charles VI, anxious for a sight of his intended
bride, took a fancy to mix in the crowd, mounted on horseback behind Savoisi,
his favourite. Pushing forward in order to approach her, he received from the
serjeants posted to keep off the populace several sharp blows on the shoulders,
which occasioned great mirth in the evening, when the circumstance was related
before the queen and her ladies.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the Boulevard towards the east, at a short distance from
the <i>Porte St. Denis</i>, you arrive at the</p>
<p class="center">PORTE SAINT MARTIN.</p>
<p>Although this triumphal arch cannot be compared to the preceding in
magnificence, it was nevertheless executed by the same artists, having been
erected in 1674. It is pierced with three openings, the centre one of which is
eighteen feet wide, and the two others nine. The whole structure, which is
fifty-four feet both in height and breadth, is rusticated, and in the spandles
of the arch are four bas-reliefs; the two towards the city represent the
capture of Besançon, and the rupture of the triple alliance; and those towards
the faubourg, the capture of Lomberg, and the defeat of the Germans under the
emblem of an eagle repulsed by the god of war. These bas-reliefs are crowned by
an entablature of the Doric order, surmounted by an attic. The <i>Porte St.
Martin</i> is the grand entrance into Paris from all parts of Flanders.</p>
<p>At the west extremity of this <i>North</i> Boulevard, facing the <i>Rue de
la Concorde</i>, stands an unfinished church, called <i>La Magdeleine</i>,
whose cemetery received not only the bodies of Lewis XVI, his consort, and his
sister, but of the greater part of the victims that perished by guillotine.</p>
<p>In the space comprised between <i>La Magdeleine</i> and the <i>Vieille Rue
du Temple</i>, I speak within compass when I say that there are sometimes to be
seen fifty ambulating conjurers of both sexes. They all vary the form of their
art. Some have tables, surmounted by flags, bearing mysterious devices; some
have wheels, with compartments adapted to every age and profession&mdash;One
has a robe charged with hieroglyphics, and tells you your fortune through a
long tube which conveys the sound to your ear; the other makes you choose in a
parcel, a square piece of white paper, which becomes covered with characters at
the moment when it is thrown into a jug that appears empty. The secret of this
is as follows:</p>
<p>The jug contains a little sulphuret of potash, and the words are written
with acetite of lead. The action of the exterior air, on, the sulphuret of
potash, disengages from it sulphurated hydrogen gas, which, acting on the oxyd
of lead, brings to view the characters that before were invislble.</p>
<p>Here, the philosophic Parisians stop before the movable stall of an
astrologer, who has surmounted it with an owl, as an emblem of his magic
wisdom. Many of them take this animal for a curiosity imported from foreign
countries; for they are seldom able to distinguish a bat from a swallow.</p>
<p>"Does that bird come from China, my dear?" says a lusty dame to her elderly
husband, a shopkeeper of the <i>Rue St. Denis</i>.&mdash;"I don't know, my
love," replies the other.&mdash;"What eyes it has got," continues she; "it must
see a great deal better than we." "No;" cries a countryman standing by; "though
its eyes are so big, it can't, in broad day, tell a cow from a calf."</p>
<p>The lady continues her survey of the scientific repository; and the
conjurer, with an air of importance, proposes to her to draw, for two
<i>sous</i>, a motto from Merlin's wheel. "Take one, my dear," says the
husband; "I wish to know whether you love me." The wife blushes and hesitates;
the husband insists; she refuses, and is desirous of continuing her walk,
saying that it is all foolishness.&mdash;"What if it is?" rejoins the husband,
"I've paid, so take a motto to please me." For this once, the lady is quite at
a nonplus; she at last consents, and, with a trembling hand, draws a card from
the magic wheel: the husband unrolls it with eagerness and confidence, and
reads these words: "<i>My young lover is and will be constant</i>."&mdash;"What
the devil does this mean?" exclaims the old husband; quite disconcerted.
&mdash;"'Tis a mistake," says the conjurer; "the lady put her hand into the
wrong box; she drew the motto from the wheel for <i>young girls</i>, instead of
that for <i>married women</i>. Let <i>Madame</i> draw again, she shall pay
nothing more."&mdash;"No, Mr. Conjurer," replies the shopkeeper, "that's
enough. I've no faith in such nonsense; but another time, madam, take care that
you don't put your hand into the wrong box." The fat lady, with her face as red
as fire, follows her husband, who walks off grumbling, and it is easy to see,
by their gestures, that the fatal motto has sown discord in the family, and
confirmed the shopkeeper's suspicions.</p>
<p>Independently of these divers into futurity, the corners of streets and
walls of public squares, are covered with hand-bills announcing books
containing secrets, sympathetic calculations of numbers in the lottery, the
explanation of dreams in regard to those numbers, together with the different
manners of telling fortunes, and interpreting prognostics.</p>
<p>At all times, the marvellous has prevailed over simple truth, and the Cumæan
Sibyl attracted the inquisitive in greater crowds than Socrates, Plato, or any
philosopher, had pupils in the whole course of their existence.</p>
<p>In Paris, the sciences are really making a rapid progress, notwithstanding
the fooleries of the pseudo-philosophers, who parade the streets, and here, on
the <i>Boulevards</i>, as well as in other parts of the town, exhibit lessons
of physics.</p>
<p>One has an electrifying machine, and phials filled with phosphorus: for two
<i>sous</i>, he gives you a slight shock, and makes you a present of a small
phial.</p>
<p>Farther on, you meet with a <i>camera obscura</i>, whose effect surprises
the spectators the more, as the objects represented within it have the motion
which they do not find in common optics.</p>
<p>There, you see a double refracting telescope: for two <i>sous</i>, you enjoy
its effect. At either end, you place any object whatever, and though a hat, a
board, or a child be introduced between the two glasses, the object placed
appears not, on that account, the less clear and distinct to the eye of the
person looking through the opposite glass. <i>Pierre</i> has seen, and cannot
believe his eyes: <i>Jacques</i> wishes to see, and, on seeing, is in ecstacy:
next comes <i>Fanchon</i>, who remains stupified. Enthusiasm becomes general,
and the witnesses of their delirium are ready to go mad at not having two
<i>sous</i> in their pocket.</p>
<p>Another fellow, in short, has a microscope, of which he extols the beauty,
and, above all, the effects: he will not describe the causes which produce
them, because he is unacquainted with them; but, provided he adapts his lessons
to the understanding of those who listen to him, this is all he wants.
Sometimes he may be heard to say to the people about him: "Gentlemen, give me a
creeping insect, and for one <i>sou</i>, I will shew it to you as big as my
fist." Sometimes too, unfortunately for him, the insect which he requires is
more easily found among part of his auditors, than the money.</p>
<p>P.S. For the preceding account of the Parisian conjurers I am indebted to M.
Pujoulx.</p>
<h2><a name="let28">LETTER XXVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 4, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>In one of your former letters you questioned me on a subject, which, though
it had not escaped my notice, I was desirous to avoid, till I should be able to
obtain on it some precise information. This I have done; and I hasten to
present you with the following sketch, which will afford you a
tolerably-correct idea of the</p>
<p class="center">FRENCH FUNDS, AND NATIONAL DEBT.</p>
<p>The booked or consolidated debt is called</p>
<p class="center">TIERS CONSOLIDÉ,</p>
<p>from its being the consolidated third of the national debt, of which the
remaining two-thirds were reimbursed in <i>Bons de deux Tiers</i> in 1797 and
98. It bears interest at five per Cent. payable half yearly at the <i>Banque de
France</i>. The payment of the interest is at present six months in arrear. But
the intention of the government is, by paying off in specie the interest of one
whole year, to pay in future as soon as due.</p>
<p>The days of payment are the 1st of Germinal (23d of March) and the 1st of
Vendémiaire (23d of September).</p>
<p>This stock purchased at the present price of from 55 to 60 would produce
from eight to nine per cent. The general opinion is, that it will rise to 80;
and as it is the chief stock, and the standard of the national credit, it is
the interest, and must be the constant object of the government to keep up its
price.</p>
<p>There is a <i>Caisse d'amortissement</i> or Sinking Fund, for the special
purpose of paying off this stock, the effect of which, though not exactly
known, must shortly be very considerable. The <i>Tiers Consolidé</i> is
saleable and transferable at a moment's warning, and at a trifling expense. It
is not subject to taxation, nor open to attachments, either on the principal or
interest.</p>
<p>For purchasing, no sort of formality is required; but for receiving
interest, or selling, it is necessary to produce a power of attorney. An
established rule is, that the seller always retains his right to half a year's
interest at the succeeding stated period of payment, so that he who purchases
in the interval between March and September, is entitled to the interest
commencing from the 23d of the latter month only; and he who buys between
September and March, receives not his first dividend till the 23d of the
following September.</p>
<p class="center">TIERS PROVISOIRE.</p>
<p>This is the debt, yet unbooked, which is composed of the provisional claims
of the creditors of the emigrants, the contractors, and various other holders
of claims on the government.</p>
<p>The <i>Tiers Provisoire</i> is to be booked before the 1st of Vendémiaire,
year XII of the Republic (23d of September, 1803), and will from that day bear
interest of five per cent; so that, setting aside the danger of any retrospect
in the interval, and that of any other change, it is at the present price, of
from 15 to 50, cheaper than the <i>Tiers Consolidé</i> to which, in about
eighteen months, it will, in every respect, be assimilated.</p>
<p class="center">BONS DE DEUX TIERS,</p>
<p>Is paper issued for the purpose of reimbursing the reduced two-thirds of the
National Debt, and in the origin rendered applicable to the purchase of
national houses and estates in the French Colonies, since ordered to be funded
at five per cent; so that the price of this species of paper is entirely
subordinate to that of the <i>Tiers Consolidé</i> and supposing that to be 60
francs per cent, the <i>Bon de deux Tiers</i> would be worth 3 francs. There
are no hopes, however distant, that the government will ever restore the
<i>Bons de deux Tiers</i> to their original value.</p>
<p class="center">BONS DE TROIS QUARTS,</p>
<p>So called from having been issued for the purpose of reimbursing the
three-fourths of the interest of the fifth and sixth years of the Republic
(1797 to 1798). They are, in all respects, assimilated to the preceding
stock.</p>
<p class="center">COUPONS D'EMPRUNT FORCÉ.</p>
<p>These are the receipts given by the government to the persons who
contributed to the various forced loans. This paper is likewise assimilated to
the two last-mentioned species, with this difference, that it is generally
considered as a less sacred claim, and is therefore liquidated with greater
difficulty. The holders of these three claims are hastening the liquidation and
consolidation of them, and they are evidently right in so doing.</p>
<p class="center">QUARTS AU NOM ET QUART NUMÉRAIRE.</p>
<p>This paper is thus denominated from its having been issued for the purpose
of reimbursing the fourth of the dividend of the fifth and sixth years of the
Republic (1797 to 1798). It is generally thought that this very sacred claim on
the government will be funded <i>in toto</i>.</p>
<p class="center">RACHATS DE RENTE,</p>
<p>Is the name given to the redemption of perpetual annuities due by
individuals to the government, on a privileged mortgage on landed estates; the
said annuities having been issued by the government in times of great distress,
for the purpose of supplying immediate and urgent events.</p>
<p>This paper is not only a mere government security, but is also specially
mortgaged on the estates of the person who owes the annuity to the government,
and who is, at any time, at liberty to redeem it at from twenty to twenty-five
years purchase. Claims of this description, mortgaged on most desirable estates
near the metropolis, might be obtained for less than 60 per cent; which, at the
interest of five per cent, and with the additional advantage, in some
instances, of the arrears of one or two years, would produce between eight and
nine per cent.</p>
<p>Next to the <i>Tiers Consolidé</i>, <i>Rachats de Rente</i> are particularly
worthy of attention; indeed, this debt is of so secure and sacred a nature,
that the government has appropriated a considerable part of it to the special
purpose and service of the hospitals and schools; two species of institutions
which ought ever to be sheltered from all vicissitudes, and which, whatever may
be the form or character of the government, must be supported and
respected.</p>
<p class="center">ACTIONS DE LA BANQUE DE FRANCE.</p>
<p>These are shares in the National Bank of France, which are limited to the
number of thirty thousand, and were originally worth one thousand francs each;
they therefore form a capital of 30,000,000 francs, or £1,250,000 sterling, and
afford as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>A dividend which at present, and since the foundation, has averaged from
eight to ten per cent, arising from the profits on discount.</li>
<li>A profit of from four to five per cent more on the discount of paper, which
every holder of an <i>action</i> or share effects at the Bank, at the rate of
one-half per cent per month, or six per cent for the whole year.</li>
</ol>
<p>The present price of an <i>action</i> is about twelve hundred francs, which
may be considered as producing:</p>
<table summary="paris" >
<tr><td align="right">80 francs;</td><td>dividend paid by the Bank on each
share.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">30 francs;</td><td>certain profits according to the
present discount of bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">110 francs;</td><td> per share 10-10/11 per
cent.</td></tr>
</table>
<p><i>Actions de la Banque de France</i>, though subject, in common with all
stocks, to the influence of the government, are, however, far more independent
of it than any other, and are the more secure, as the National Bank is not only
composed of all the first bankers, but also supported by the principal
merchants in the country. This investment is at present very beneficial, and
certainly promises great eventual advantages. The dividends are paid in two
half-yearly instalments.</p>
<p class="center">ACTIONS DE LA CAISSE DE COMMERCE,<br />
ET ACTIONS DU COMPTOIR COMMERCIAL.</p>
<p>The <i>Caisse de Commerce</i> and the <i>Comptoir Commercial</i> are two
establishments on the same plan, and affording, as nearly as possible, the same
advantages as the <i>Banque de France</i>: the
only difference is as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>These last two are, as far as any commercial establishment can be,
independent of the government, and are more so than the <i>Banque de
France</i>, as the <i>actions</i> or shares are not considered as being a
public fund.</li>
<li>The <i>Actions de la Caisse de Commerce</i> limited in number to two
thousand four hundred, originally cost 5000 francs, and are now worth 6000. The
holder of each <i>action</i> moreover, signs circulating notes to the amount of
five thousand francs, which form the paper currency of the Bank, and for the
payment of which the said holder would be responsible, were the Bank to stop
payment.</li>
<li>The <i>Actions du Comptoir Commercial</i> are still issued by the
administrators of the establishment. The number of <i>actions</i> is not as yet
limited: the price of each <i>action</i> is fifteen hundred francs
(<i>circa</i> £60 sterling), and the plan and advantages are almost entirely
similar to those of the two last-mentioned institutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <i>Banque de France</i> the <i>Caisse de Commerce</i>, and the
<i>Comptoir Commercial</i>, discount three times a week. The first, the paper
of the banking-houses and the principal commercial houses holding bank-stock;
the second, the paper of the wholesale merchants of every class; and the third,
the paper of retailers of all descriptions; and in a circulation which amounts
to 100 millions of francs (<i>circa</i> 4 millions sterling) per month, there
have not, it is said, been seen, in the course of the last month, protests to
the amount of 20,000 francs.</p>
<p class="center">BONS DE L'AN VII ET DE L'AN VIII.</p>
<p>Is a denomination applied to paper, issued for the purpose of paying the
dividend of the debt during the seventh and eighth years of the Republic.</p>
<p>These <i>Bons</i> are no further deserving of notice than as they still form
a part of the floating debt, and are an article of the supposed liquidation at
the conclusion of the present summary. It is therefore unnecessary to say more
of them.</p>
<p class="center">ARRÉRAGES DES ANNÉES V ET VI.</p>
<p>These are the arrears due to such holders of stock as, during the fifth and
sixth years of the Republic, had not their dividend paid in <i>Bons de trois
Quarts</i> and <i>Quart Numéraire</i>, mentioned in Art. IV and VI of this
sketch. I also notice them as forming an essential part of the above-mentioned
supposed liquidation, at the end of the sketch, and shall only add that it is
the general opinion that they will be funded.</p>
<p>To the preceding principal investments and claims on the government, might
be added the following:</p>
<p class="bq">
<i>Coupes de Bois.<br />
Cédules Hypothécaires.<br />
Rescriptions de Domaines Nationaux.<br />
Actions de la Caisse des Rentiers.<br />
Actions des Indes.<br />
Bons de Moines et Réligieuses.<br />
Obligations de Reçeveur.</i><br />
</p>
<p>However, they are almost entirely unworthy of attention, and afford but
occasionally openings for speculation. Of the last, <i>(Obligations de
Reçeveur)</i> it may be necessary to observe that they are monthy acceptances
issued by the Receivers-General of all the departments, which the government
has given to the five bankers, charged with supplying money for the current
service, as security for their advances, and which are commonly discounted at
from 7/8 to one per cent per month.</p>
<p>I shall terminate this concise, though accurate sketch of the French funds
by a general statement of the National Debt, and by an account of an annuity
supposed to be held by a foreigner before the revolution, and which, to become
<i>Tiers Consolidé</i>, must undergo the regular process of reduction and
liquidation.</p>

<h2><a name="let29">LETTER XXIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 7, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>At the grand monthly parade of the 15th of last Brumaire, I had seen the
First Consul chiefly on horseback: on which account, I determined to avail
myself of that of the 15th of the present month of Frimaire, in order to obtain
a nearer view of his person. On these occasions, none but officers in complete
uniform are admitted into the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, unless provided
with tickets, which are distributed to a certain number at the discretion of
the governor. General A----y sent me tickets by ten o'clock this morning, and
about half after eleven, I repaired to the palace.</p>
<p>On reaching the vestibule from the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>, you
ascend the grand stair-case to the left, which conducts you to the guard-room
above it in the centre pavilion. Hence you enter the apartments of the Chief
Consul.</p>
<p>On the days of the grand parade, the first room is destined for officers as
low as the rank of captain, and persons admitted with tickets; the second, for
field-officers; the third, for generals; and the fourth, for councellors of
state, and the diplomatic corps. To the east, the windows of these apartments
command the court-yard where the troops are assembled; while to the west, they
afford a fine view of the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i> and the avenue leading
to the <i>Barrière de Chaillot</i>. In the first-room, those windows which
overlook the parade were occupied by persons standing five or six in depth,
some of whom, as I was informed, had been patient enough to retain their places
for the space of two or three hours, and among them were a few ladies. Here, a
sort of lane was formed from door to door by some grenadiers of the consular
guard. I found both sides of this lane so much crowded, that I readily accepted
the invitation of a <i>chef de brigade</i> of my acquaintance to accompany him
into the second room; this, he observed, was no more than a privilege to which
I was entitled. This room was also crowded; but it exhibited a most brilliant
<i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> from the great variety and richness of the uniforms of
the field-officers here assembled, by which mine was entirely eclipsed. The
lace or embroidery is not merely confined to the coats, jackets, and
pantaloons, but extends to the sword belts, and even to the boots, which are
universally worn by the military. Indeed, all the foreign ambassadors admit
that none of the levees of the European courts can vie in splendour with those
of the Chief Consul.</p>
<p>My first care on entering this room, was to place myself in a situation
which might afford me an uninterrupted view of BONAPARTE. About twenty-five
minutes past twelve, his sortie was announced by a <i>huissier</i>. Immediately
after, he came out of the inner apartment, attended by several officers of
rank, and, traversing all the other rooms with a quick step, proceeded,
uncovered, to the parade, the order of which I have described to you in a
former letter. On the present occasion, however, it lasted longer on account of
the distribution of arms of honour, which the First Consul presents with his
own hand to those heroes who have signalized themselves in fighting their
country's battles.</p>
<p>This part of the ceremony, which was all that I saw of the parade yesterday,
naturally revived in my mind the following question, so often agitated: "Are
the military successes of the French the consequences of a new system of
operations and new tactics, or merely the effect of the blind courage of a mass
of men, led on by chiefs whose resolutions were decided by presence of mind
alone and circumstances?"</p>
<p>The latter method of explaining their victories has been frequently adopted,
and the French generals have been reproached with lavishing the lives of
thousands for the sake of gaining unimportant advantages, or repairing
inconsiderable faults.</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, it should seem that a murderous obstinacy has obtained
them successes to which prudence had not paved the way; but, certainly, the
French can boast, too, of memorable days when talent had traced the road to
courage, when vast plans combined with judgment, have been followed with
perseverance, when resources have been found in those awful moments in which
Victory, hovering over a field of carnage, leaves the issue of the conflict
doubtful, till a sudden thought, a ray of genius, inclines her in favour of the
general, thus inspired, and then art may be said to triumph over art, and
valour over valour.</p>
<p>And whence came most of these generals who have shewn this inspiration, if I
may so term it? Some, as is well known, emerged from the schools of
jurisprudence; some, from the studies of the arts; and others, from the
counting-houses of commerce, as well as from the lowest ranks of the army.
Previously to the revolution it was not admitted, in this country at least,
that such sources could furnish men fit to be one day the arbiters of battles
and of the fate of empires. Till that period, all those Frenchmen who had
distinguished themselves in the field, had devoted themselves from their
infancy to the profession of arms, were born near the throne of which they
constituted the lustre, or in that cast who arrogated to themselves the
exclusive right of defending their country. The glory of the soldier was not
considered; and a private must have been more than a hero to be as much
remarked as a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>Men of reflection, seeing the old tactics fail against successful essays,
against enthusiasm whose effects are incalculable, studied whether new ideas
did not direct some new means; for it would have been no less absurd to grant
all to valour than to attribute all to art. But to return to the main subject
of my letter.</p>
<p>In about three quarters of an hour, BONAPARTE came back from the parade,
with the same suite as before, that is, preceded by his aides-de-camp, and
followed by the generals and field-officers of the consular guard, the governor
of the palace, the general commanding the first military division, and him at
the head of the garrison of Paris. For my part, I scarcely saw any one but
himself; BONAPARTE alone absorbed my whole attention.</p>
<p>A circumstance occurred which gave me an opportunity of observing the Chief
Consul with critical minuteness. I had left the second room, and taken my
station in front of the row of gazers, close to the folding-doors which opened
into the first room, in order to see him receive petitions and memorials. There
was no occasion for BONAPARTE to cast his eyes from side to side, like the
<i>Grand Monarque</i> coming from mass, by way of inviting petitioners to
approach him. They presented themselves in such numbers that, after he put his
hat under his arm, both his hands were full in a moment. To enable him to
receive other petitions, he was under the necessity of delivering the first two
handfuls to his aides-de-camp. I should like to learn what becomes of all these
papers, and whether he locks them up in a little desk of which he alone has the
key, as was the practice of Lewis XIV.</p>
<p>When BONAPARTE approached the door of the second room, he was effectually
impeded in his progress by a lady, dressed in white, who, throwing herself at
his feet, gracefully presented to him a memorial, which he received with much
apparent courtesy; but still seemed, by his manner, desirous to pass forward.
However, the crowd was so considerable and so intent on viewing this scene,
that the grenadiers, posted near the spot where it took place, were obliged to
use some degree of violence before they could succeed in clearing a
passage.</p>
<p>Of all the portraits which you and I have seen of BONAPARTE in England, that
painted by Masquerier, and exhibited in Piccadilly, presents the greatest
resemblance. But for his side-face, you may, for twelve <i>sous</i>, here
procure a perfect likeness of it at almost every stall in the street. In short,
his features are such as may, in my opinion, be easily copied by any artist of
moderate abilities. However incompetent I may be to the task, I shall, as you
desire it, attempt to <i>sketch</i> his person; though I doubt not that any
French <i>commis</i>, in the habit of describing people by words, might do it
greater justice.</p>
<p>BONAPARTE is rather below the middle size, somewhat inclined to stoop, and
thin in person; but, though of a slight make, he appears to be muscular, and
capable of fatigue; his forehead is broad, and shaded by dark brown hair, which
is cut short behind; his eyes, of the same colour, are full, quick, and
prominent; his nose is aquiline; his chin, protuberant and pointed; his
complexion, of a yellow hue; and his cheeks, hollow. His countenance, which is
of a melancholy cast, expresses much sagacity and reflection: his manner is
grave and deliberate, but at the same time open. On the whole, his aspect
announces him to be of a temperate and phlegmatic disposition; but warm and
tenacious in the pursuit of his object, and impatient of contradiction. Such,
at least, is the judgment which I should form of BONAPARTE from his external
appearance.</p>
<p>While I was surveying this man of universal talent, my fancy was not idle.
First, I beheld him, flushed with ardour, directing the assault of the
<i>téte-de-pont</i> at <i>Lodi</i>; next dictating a proclamation to the Beys
at <i>Cairo</i>, and styling himself the friend of the faithful; then combating
the ebullition of his rage on being foiled in the storming of <i>Acre</i> I
afterwards imagined I saw him like another CROMWELL, expelling the Council of
Five Hundred at <i>St. Cloud</i>, and seizing on the reins of government: when
established in power, I viewed him, like HANNIBAL, crossing the <i>Alps</i>,
and forcing victory to yield to him the hard-contested palm at <i>Marengo</i>;
lastly, he appeared to my imagination in the act of giving the fraternal
embrace to Caprara, the Pope's legate, and at the same time holding out to the
see of Rome the re-establishment of catholicism in France.</p>
<p>Voltaire says that "no man ever was a hero in the eyes of his
<i>valet-de-chambre</i>." I am curious to know whether the valet of the First
Consul be an exception to this maxim. As to BONAPARTE'S public character,
numerous, indeed, are the constructions put on it by the voice of rumour: some
ascribe to him one great man of antiquity as a model; some, another; but many
compare him, in certain respects, to JULIUS CÆSAR, as imitators generally
succeed better in copying the failings than the good qualities of their
archetypes, let us hope, supposing this comparison to be a just one, that the
Chief Consul will, in one particular, never lose sight of the generous clemency
of that illustrious Roman&mdash;who, if any spoke bitterly against him, deemed
it sufficient to complain of the circumstance publicly, in order to prevent
them from persevering in the use of such language. "<i>Acerbè loquentibus satis
habuit pro concione denunciare, ne perseverarent.</i>"</p>
<p><a name="let29fr1"></a>"The character of a great man," says a French
political writer, who denies the justness of this comparison, "like the
celebrated picture of Zeuxis, can be formed only of a multitude of imitations,
and it is as little possible for the observer to find for him a single model in
history, as it was for the painter of Heraclea to discover in nature that of
the ideal beauty he was desirous of
representing[<a href="#let29f1">1</a>]."&mdash;<a name="let29fr2"></a>"The
French revolution," observes the same author, a little farther on, "has,
perhaps, produced more than one CÆSAR, or one CROMWELL; but they have
disappeared before they have had it in their power to give full scope to their
ambition[<a href="#let29f2">2</a>]." Time will decide on the truth and
impartiality of these observations of M. HAUTERIVE.</p>
<p>As at the last monthly parade, BONAPARTE was habited in the consular dress,
that is, a coat of scarlet velvet, embroidered with gold: he wore jockey boots,
carelessly drawn over white cotton pantaloons, and held in his hand a cocked
hat, with the national cockade only. I say only, because all the generals wear
hats trimmed with a splendid lace, and decorated with a large, branching,
tricoloured feather.</p>
<p>After the parade, the following, I understand, is the <i>étiquette</i>
usually observed in the palace. The Chief Consul first gives audience to the
general-officers, next to the field-officers, to those belonging to the
garrison, and to a few petitioners. He then returns to the fourth apartment,
where the counsellors of state assemble. Being arrived there, notice is sent to
the diplomatic corps, who meet in a room on the ground-floor of the palace,
called <i>La Salle des Ambassadeurs</i>. They immediately repair to the
levee-room, and, after paying their personal respects to the First Consul,
they each introduce to him such persons, belonging to their respective
nations, as they may think proper. Several were this day presented by the
Imperial, Russian, and Danish ambassadors: the British minister, Mr. Jackson,
has not yet presented any of his countrymen nor will he, in all probability,
as he is merely a <i>locum tenens</i>. After the levee, the Chief Consul
generally gives a dinner of from one hundred and fifty to two hundred covers,
to which all those who have received arms of honour, are invited.</p>
<p>Before I left the palace, I observed the lady above-mentioned, who had
presented the memorial, seated in one corner of the room, all in tears, and
betraying every mark of anxious grief: she was pale, and with her hair
dishevelled; but, though by no means handsome, her distressed situation excited
a lively interest in her favour. On inquiry, I was informed that it was Madame
Bourmont, the wife of a Vendean chief, condemned to perpetual imprisonment for
a breach of the convention into which he had jointly entered with the agents of
the French government.</p>
<p>Having now accomplished my object, when the crowd was somewhat dispersed, I
retired to enjoy the fine weather by a walk in the</p>
<p class="center">CHAMPS ELYSÉES.</p>
<p>After traversing the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i> and the <i>Place de la
Concorde</i>, from east to west, you arrive at this fashionable summer
promenade. It is planted with trees in quincunx; and although, in particular
points of view, this gives it a symmetrical air; yet, in others, the hand of
art is sufficiently concealed to deceive the eye by a representation of the
irregular beauties of nature. The French, in general, admire the plan of the
garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>, and think the distribution tasteful; but, when
the trees are in leaf, all prefer the <i>Champs Elysées</i>, as being more
rural and more inviting. This spot, which is very extensive, as you may see by
the Plan of Paris, has frequently been chosen for the scene of national fêtes,
for which it is, in many respects, better calculated than the <i>Champ de
Mars</i>. However, from its proximity to the great road, the foliage is
imbrowned by the dust, and an idea of aridity intrudes itself on the
imagination from the total absence of water. The sight of that refreshing
element recreates the mind, and communicates a powerful attraction even to a
wilderness.</p>
<p>In fact, at this season of the year, the <i>Champs Elysées</i> resemble a
desert; but, in summer, they present one of the most agreeable scenes that can
be imagined. In temporary buildings, of a tasteful construction, you then find
here <i>restaurateurs</i>, &amp;c, where all sorts of refreshments may be
procured, and rooms where "the merry dance" is kept up with no common spirit.
Swings and roundabouts are also erected, as well as different machines for
exercising the address of those who are fond of running at a ring, and other
sports. Between the road leading to <i>l'Étoile</i>, the <i>Bois de
Boulogne</i>, &amp;c, and that which skirts the Seine, formerly called the
<i>Cours de la Reine</i>, is a large piece of turf, where, in fine weather, and
especially on Sundays, the Parisian youths amuse themselves at foot-ball,
prison-bars, and long tennis. Here, too, boys and girls assemble, and improve
their growth and vigour by dancing, and a variety of healthful diversions;
while their relations and friends, seated on the grass, enjoy this interesting
sight, and form around each group a circle which is presently increased by
numbers of admiring spectators.</p>
<p>Under the shade of the trees, on the right hand, as you face the west, an
immense concourse of both sexes and all ages is at the same time collected.
Those who prefer sitting to walking occupy three long rows of chairs, set out
for hire, three deep on each side, and forming a lane through which the great
body of walkers parade. This promenade may then be said to deserve the
appellation of <i>Elysian Fields</i>, from the number of handsome women who
resort hither. The variety of their dresses and figures, the satisfaction which
they express in seeing and being seen, their anxious desire to please, which
constitutes their happiness and that of our sex, the triumph which animates the
countenance of those who eclipse their rivals; all this forms a diversified and
amusing picture, which fixes attention, and gives birth to a thousand ideas
respecting the art and coquetry of women, as well as what beauty loses or gains
by adopting the ever-varying caprices of fashion. Here, on a fine summer's
evening, are now to be seen, I am told, females displaying almost as much
luxury of dress as used to be exhibited in the days of the monarchy. The
essential difference is that the road in the centre is not now, as in those
times, covered with brilliant equipages; though every day seems to produce an
augmentation of the number of private carriages. At the entrance of the
<i>Champs Elysées</i> are placed the famous groups of Numidian horses, held in
by their vigorous and masterly conductors, two <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> of
modern art, copied from the group of <i>Monte-Cavallo</i> at Rome. By order of
the Directory, these statues were brought from <i>Marly</i>, where they
ornamented the terrace. They are each of them cut out of a block of the most
faultless Carrara marble. On the pedestal on which they stood at that
once-royal residence, was engraved the name of COSTOU, 1745, without any
Christian name: but, as there were two brothers of that name, Nicolas and
Guillaume, natives of Lyons, and both excellent sculptors, it is become a
matter of doubt by which of them these master-pieces were executed; though
the one died in 1733, and the other in 1746. It is conjectured, however,
that fraternal friendship induced them to share the fame arising from these
capital productions, and that they worked at them in common till death left
the survivor the task of finishing their joint labour.</p>
<p>To whichever of the two the merit of the execution may be due, it is certain
that the fiery, ungovernable spirit of the horses, as well as the exertion of
vigour, and the triumph of strength in their conductors, is very happily
expressed. The subject has frequently afforded a comparison to politicians.
"These statues," say some observers, "appear to be the emblem of the French
people, over whom it is necessary to keep a tight hand."&mdash;"It is to be
apprehended," add others, "that the reins, which the conductors hold with so
powerful an arm, are too weak to check these ungovernable animals."</p>

<h2><a name="let30">LETTER XXX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, Dccemler 8, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>You desire that I will favour you with a particular account of the means
employed to transfer from pannel to canvas those celebrated pictures which I
mentioned in my letter of the 13th ult&deg;. Like many other, things that
appear simple on being known, so is this process; but it is not, on that
account, the less ingenious and difficult in execution.</p>
<p>Such is the great disadvantage of the art of painting that, while other
productions of genius may survive the revolution of ages, the creations of the
pencil are intrusted to perishable wood or canvas. From the effect of heat,
humidity, various exhalations to which they may be carelessly exposed, and even
an unperceived neglect in the priming of the pannel or cloth, master-pieces are
in danger of disappearing for ever. Happy, then, is it for the arts that this
invaluable discovery has been lately brought to so great a degree of
perfection, and that the restoration of several capital pictures having been
confided to men no less skilful than enlightened, they have thus succeeded in
rescuing them from approaching and inevitable destruction.</p>
<p>Of all the fruits of the French conquests, not a painting was brought from
Lombardy, Rome, Florence, or Venice, that was not covered with an accumulation
of filth, occasioned by the smoke of the wax-tapers and incense used in the
ceremonies of the catholic religion. It was therefore necessary to clean and
repair them; for to bring them to France, without rendering them fit to be
exhibited, would have answered no better purpose than to have left them in
Italy. One of those which particularly fixed the attention of the
Administration of the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, was the famous picture by
RAPHAEL, taken from the <i>Chiesa delle Contesse</i> at Foligno, and thence
distinguished by the appellation of</p>
<p class="center">MADONNA DI FOLIGNO.</p>
<p>This <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> was in such a lamentable state of decay, that
the French commissioners who selected it, wereunder the necessity of pasting
paper over it in order to prevent the scales, which curled up on many parts of
its surface, from falling off during its conveyance to to Paris. In short, had
not the saving hand of art interposed, this, and other monuments of the
transcendent powers of the Italian school, marked by the corroding tooth of
Time, would soon have entirely perished.</p>
<p>As this picture could not be exhibited in its injured state, the
Administration of the Museum determined that it should be repaired. They
accordingly requested the Minister of the Interior to cause this important
operation to be attended by Commissioners chosen from the National Institute.
The Class of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of that learned Society
appointed to this task, GUYTON and BERTHOLLET, chymists, and the Class of
Literature and Fine Arts named VINCENT and TAUNAY, painters.</p>
<p>These Commissioners, in concert with the Administration, having ascertained
the state of the picture, it was unanimously agreed that the only mean of
saving it would be to remove it from the worm-eaten pannel on which it was
painted. It was, besides, necessary to ascertain the safety of the process, in
order that, without, exciting the apprehensions of the lovers of the arts, it
might be applied to other pictures which required it.</p>
<p>The Report of the four Commissioners before named, respecting the
restoration of the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i>, has been adopted by the Classes
to which they respectively belong, and is to be made to the National Institute
at their next public sitting on the 15th of Nivose (5th of January, 1802).</p>
<p>In order to make you perfectly acquainted with the whole of the process, I
shall transcribe, for your satisfaction, that part of the Report immediately
connected with the art of restoring damaged or decayed paintings. This labour,
and the success by which it was attended, are really a memorial of what the
genius and industry of the French can achieve. To all those who, like you,
possess valuable collections, such information cannot but be particularly
interesting.</p>
<p>"The desire of repairing the outrages of time has unfortunately accelerated
the decay of several pictures by coarse repainting and bad varnish, by which
much of the original work has been covered. Other motives, too, have conspired
against the purity of the most beautiful compositions: a prelate has been seen
to cause a discordant head of hair to conceal the charms of a Magdalen."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, efficacious means of restoration have been discovered: a
painting, the convass of which is decayed, or the pannel worm-eaten, is
transferred to a fresh cloth; the profane touches of a foreign pencil are made
to disappear; the effaced strokes are reinserted with scrupulous nicety; and
life is restored to a picture which was disfigured, or drawing near to its end.
<a name="let30fr1"></a>This art has made great progress, especially in Paris,
and experienced recent improvement under the superintendance of the
Administration of the Museum; but it is only with a religious respect that any
one can venture on an operation which may always give rise to a fear of some
change in the drawing or colouring, above all when the question is to restore a
picture by RAPHAEL."[<a href="#let30f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>"The restoration may be divided into two parts; the one, which is composed
of mechanical operations, whose object is to detach the painting from the
ground on which it is fixed, in order to transfer it to a fresh one; the other,
which consists in cleaning the surface of the painting from every thing that
can tarnish it, in restoring the true colour of the picture, and in repairing
the parts destroyed, by tints skilfully blended with the primitive touches.
Thence the distinctive division of the mechanical operations, and of the art of
painting, which will be the object of the two parts of this Report. The former
particularly engaged the attention of the Commissioners of the <i>Class of
Sciences</i>; and the latter, which required the habit of handling a scientific
pencil, fell to the share of the Commissioners of the <i>Class of Fine
Arts</i>"</p>
<p class="center">FIRST PART.</p>
<p>"Although the mechanical labour is subdivided into several operations, it
was wholly intrusted to Citizen HACQUINS, on whose intelligence, address, and
skill, it is our duty to bestow every commendation."</p>
<p>"The picture represents the Virgin Mary, the infant Jesus, St. John, and
several other figures of different sizes. It was painted on a pannel of 1-1/2
inches in thickness: a crack extended from its circumference to the left foot
of the infant Jesus: it was 4-1/2 lines wide at its upper part, and diminished
progressively to the under: from this crack to the right hand border, the
surface formed a curve whose greatest bend was 2 inches 5-1/2 lines, and from
the crack to the other border, another curve bending 2 inches. The picture was
scaling off in several places, and a great number of scales had already
detached themselves; the painting was, besides, worm-eaten in many parts."</p>
<p>"It was first necessary to render the surface even: to effect this, a gauze
was pasted on the painting, and the picture was turned on its face. After that,
Citizen HACQUINS made, in the thickness of the wood, several grooves at some
distance from each other, and extending from the upper extremity of the bend to
the place where the pannel presented a more level surface. Into these grooves
he introduced little wooden wedges; he then covered the whole surface with wet
cloths, which he took care to remoisten. The action of the wedges, which
swelled by the moisture against the softened pannel, compelled the latter to
resume its primitive form: both edges of the crack before-mentioned being
brought together, the artist had recourse to glue, in order to unite the two
separated parts. During the desiccation, he laid oak bars across the picture,
for the purpose of keeping the pannel in the form which he wished it to
assume."</p>
<p>"The desiccation being effected slowly, the artist applied a second gauze on
the first, then successively two thicknesses of grey blotting paper."</p>
<p>"This preparation (which the French artists call <i>cartonnage</i>) being
dry, he laid the picture with its face downward on a table, to which he
carefully confined it; he next proceeded to the separation of the wood on which
the painting was fixed."</p>
<p>"The first operation was executed by means of two saws, one of which acted
perpendicularly; and the other, horizontally: the work of the two saws being
terminated, the pannel was found to be reduced to the thickness of 4-1/2 lines.
The artist then made use of a plane of a convex form on its breadth: with this
instrument he planed the pannel in an oblique direction, in order to take off
very short shavings, and to avoid the grain of the wood: by these means he
reduced the pannel to 2/3 of a line in thickness. He then took a flat plane
with a toothed iron, whose effect is much like that of a rasp which reduces
wood into dust: in this manner he contrived to leave the pannel no thicker than
a sheet of paper."</p>
<p>"In that state, the wood was successively moistened with clear water, in
small compartments, which disposed it to detach itself: then the artist
separated it with the rounded point of a knife-blade."</p>
<p>"The picture, thus deprived of all the wood, presented to the eye every
symptom of the injury which it had sustained. It had formerly been repaired;
and, in order to fasten again the parts which threatened to fall off, recourse
had been had to oils and varnishes. But those ingredients passing through the
intervals left by such parts of the picture as were reduced to curling scales,
had been extended in the impression to the paste, on which the painting rested,
and had rendered the real restoration more difficult, without producing the
advantageous effect which had thence been expected."</p>
<p>"The same process would not serve for separating the parts of the impression
which had been indurated by varnishes, and those where the paste had remained
unmixed: it was necessary to moisten the former for some time in small
compartments: when they were become sufficiently softened, the artist separated
them with the blade of his knife: the others were more easily separated by
moistening them with a flannel, and rubbing them slightly. It required all the
address and patience of Citizen HACQUINS to leave nothing foreign to the work
of the original painter: at length the outline of RAPHAEL was wholly exposed to
view, and left by itself."</p>
<p>"In order to restore a little suppleness to the painting, which was too much
dried, it was rubbed all over with carded cotton imbibed with oil, and wiped
with old muslin: then white lead, ground with oil, was substituted in the room
of the impression made by paste, and fixed by means of a soft brush."</p>
<p>"After being left to dry for three months, a gauze was glued on the
impression made by oil; and on the latter, a fine canvas."</p>
<p>"When this canvas was dry, the picture was detached from the table, and
turned, in order to remove the <i>cartonnage</i> from it with water; this
operation being effected, the next proceeding was to get rid of the appearance
of the inequalities of the surface arising from the curling up of its parts:
for that purpose, the artist successively applied on the inequalities,
flour-paste diluted. Then having put a greasy paper on the moistened part, he
laid a hot iron on the parts curled up, which became level: but it was not till
after he had employed the most unequivocal signs to ascertan the suitable
degree of heat, that he ventured to come near the painting with the iron."</p>
<p>"It has been seen that the painting, disengaged from its impression made by
paste and from every foreign substance, had been fixed on an impression made by
oil, and that a level form had been given to the uneven parts of its surface.
This master-piece was still to be solidly applied on a new ground: for that, it
was necessary to paste paper over it again, detach it from the temporary gauze
which had been put on the impression, add a new coat of oxyde of lead and oil,
apply to it a gauze rendered very supple, and on the latter, in like manner
done over with a preparation of lead, a raw cloth, woven all in one piece, and
impregnated, on its exterior surface, with a resinous substance, which was to
confine it to a similar canvass fixed on the stretching-frame. This last
operation required that the body of the picture, disengaged from its
<i>cartonnage</i>, or paper facing, and furnished with a new ground, should be
exactly applied to the cloth done over with resinous substances, at the same
time avoiding every thing that might hurt it by a too strong or unequal
extension, and yet compelling every part of its vast extent to adhere to the
cloth strained on the stretching-frame. It is by all these proceedings that the
picture has been incorporated with a ground more durable than the original one,
and guarded against the accidents which had produced the injuries. It was then
subjected to restoration, which is the object of the second part of this
Report."</p>
<p>"We have been obliged to confine ourselves to pointing out the successive
operations, the numerous details of which we have attended; we have endeavoured
to give an idea of this interesting art, by which the productions of the pencil
may be indefinitely perpetuated, in order only to state the grounds of the
confidence that it has appeared to us to merit."</p>
<p class="center">SECOND PART.</p>
<p>"After having given an account of the mechanical operations, employed with
so much success in the first part of the restoration of the picture by RAPHAEL,
it remains for us to speak of the second, the restoration of the painting,
termed by the French artists <i>restauration pittoresque</i>. This part is no
less interesting than the former. We are indebted to it for the reparation of
the ravages of time and of the ignorance of men, who, from their unskilfulness,
had still added to the injury which this master-piece had already suffered.</p>
<p>"This essential part of the restoration of works of painting, requires, in
those who are charged with it, a very delicate eye, in order to know how to
accord the new tints with the old, a profound knowledge of the proceedings
employed by masters, and a long experience, in order to foresee, in the choice
and use of colours, what changes time may effect in the new tints, and
consequently prevent the discordance which would be the result of those
changes.</p>
<p>"The art of restoring paintings likewise requires the most scrupulous nicety
to cover no other than the damaged parts, and an extraordinary address to match
the work of the restoration with that of the master, and, as it were, replace
the first priming in all its integrity, concealing the work to such a degree
that even unexperienced eye cannot distinguish what comes from the hand of the
artist from what belongs to that of the master.</p>
<p>"It is, above all, in a work of the importance of that of which we are
speaking, that the friends of the arts have a right to require, in its
restoration, all the care of prudence and the exertion of the first talents. We
feel a real satisfaction in acquainting you with the happy result of the
discriminating wisdom of the Administration of the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS;
who, after having directed and superintended the first part of the restoration,
employed in the second, that of the painting (which we call <i>pittoresque</i>)
Citizen ROESER, whose abilities in this line were long known to them, and whose
repeated success had justified their confidence."</p>
<p>After having assured the Institute that they consider the <i>pittoresque</i>
part of the restoration of the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i> as pure as it was
possible to be desired, the Commissioners proceed to call their attention to
some discordance in the original design and colouring of this <i>chef
d'&oelig;uvre</i>, and to make on it some critical observations. This they do
in order to prevent any doubts which might arise in the mind of observers, and
lead them to imagine that the restoration had, in any manner, impaired the work
of RAPHAEL.</p>
<p>They next congratulate themselves on having at length seen this masterpiece
of the immortal RAPHAEL restored to life, shining in all its lustre, and
through such means, that there ought no longer to remain any fear respecting
the recurrence of those accidents whose ravages threatened to snatch it for
ever from general admiration.</p>
<p>They afterwards terminate their Report in the following words:</p>
<p>"The Administration of the CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, who have, by their
knowledge, improved the art of restoration, will, no doubt, neglect nothing to
preserve that art in all its integrity; and, notwithstanding repeated success,
they will not permit the application of it but to pictures so injured, that
there are more advantages in subjecting them to a few risks inseparable from
delicate and numerous operations, than in abandoning them to the destruction by
which they are threatened. The invitation which the Administration of the
Museum gave to the National Institute to attend the restoration of the
<i>Madonna di Foligno</i> by RAPHAEL, is to us a sure pledge that the
enlightened men of whom it is composed felt that they owed an account of their
vigilance to all the connoisseurs in Europe."</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let30f1">Footnote 1</a>: It may not be amiss to observe
that RAPHAEL employed the <i>impasto</i> colour but in few of his pictures, of
which the <i>Transfiguration</i> is one wherein it is the most conspicuous: his
other productions are painted with great transparency, the colours being laid
on a white ground; which rendered still more difficult the operation
above-mentioned. <i>Note of the

<h2><a name="let31">LETTER XXXI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 10, 1801.</i></p>
<p>"Of all the bridges that were ever built," says Sterne, "the whole world,
who have passed over it, must own that the noblest&mdash;the grandest&mdash;the
lightest&mdash;the longest&mdash;the broadest that ever conjoined land and land
together upon the face of the terraqueous globe, is the</p>
<p class="center">PONT NEUF."</p>
<p><a name="let31fr1"></a>The <i>Pont Neuf</i> is certainly the largest, and,
on account of its situation[<a href="#let31f1">1</a>], the most conspicuous,
and most frequented of any of the bridges in Paris; but, in the environs of the
capital, is one which surpasses them all. This is the <i>Pont de
Neuilly.</i></p>
<p>The first stone of the <i>Pont Neuf</i> was laid by Henry III in 1578, and
the foundation of the piles was begun to be formed on the opposite side; when
the troubles of the League forced DU CERCEAU, the architect, to withdraw to
foreign countries. The work was not resumed till the reign of Henry IV, who
ordered it to be continued under the direction of MARCHAND; but, owing to
various causes, the <i>Pont Neuf</i> was not finished till 1674.</p>
<p>The length of this bridge is one thousand and twenty feet, and its breadth
seventy-two; which is sufficient to admit of five carriages passing abreast. It
is formed of twelve arches, seven of which are on the side of the
<i>Louvre</i>, and five on the side of the <i>Quai des Augustins</i>, extending
over the two channels of the river, which is wider in this place, from their
junction.</p>
<p>In 1775, the parapets were repaired, and the foot-way lowered and narrowed.
SOUFFLOT, the architect of the Pantheon, availed himself of this opportunity to
build, on the twenty half-moons which stand immediately above each pile, as
many rotundas, in stone, to serve as shops. On the outside, above the arches,
is a double cornice, which attracts the eye of the connoisseur in architecture,
notwithstanding its mouldering state, on account of the <i>fleurons</i> in the
antique style, and the heads of Sylvans, Dryads, and Satyrs, which serve as
supports to it, at the distance of two feet from each other.</p>
<p>As the mole that forms a projection on this bridge between the fifth and
seventh arch, stands facing the <i>Place Dauphine</i>, which was built by Henry
IV, it was the spot chosen for erecting to him a statue. This was the first
public monument of the kind that had been raised in honour of French kings.
Under the first, second, and third race, till the reign of Lewis XIII, if the
statue of a king was made, it was only for the purpose, of being placed on his
tomb, or else at the portal of some church, or royal residence which he had
either built or repaired.</p>
<p>Parisians and strangers used to admire this equestrian statue of Henry IV,
and before the revolution, all agreed in taking him for the model of goodness.
In proof of his popularity, we are told, in the <i>Tableau de Paris</i>, that a
beggar was one day following a passenger along, the foot-way, of the <i>Pont
Neuf</i>: it was a festival. "In the name of St. Peter," said the mendicant,
"in the name of St. Joseph, in the name of the Virgin Mary, in the name of her
divine Son, in the name of God?" Being arrived before the statue of the
conqueror of the League, "In the name of <i>Henri quatre</i>" exclaimed he, "in
the name of <i>Henri quatre?</i>"&mdash;"Here!" said the passenger, and he gave
him a louis d'or.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, no monarch that ever sat on the throne of France was so
popular as <i>Henri quatre</i>; and his popularity was never eclipsed by any of
his successors. Even amidst the rage of the revolutionary storm, the military
still held his memory in veneration. On opening the sepultures at St. Denis in
1793, the coffin of Henry IV was the first that was taken out of the vault of
the Bourbons. Though he died in 1610, his body was found in such preservation
that the features of his face were not altered. A soldier, who was present at
the opening of the coffin, moved by a martial enthusiasm, threw himself on the
body of this warlike prince, and, after a considerable pause of admiration, he
drew his sabre, and cut off a long lock of Henry's beard, which was still
fresh, at the same time exclaiming, in very energetic and truly-military terms:
"And I too am a French soldier! In future I will have no other whiskers." Then
placing this valuable lock on his upper lip, he withdrew, adding emphatically:
"Now I am sure to conquer the enemies of France, and I march to victory."</p>
<p>In Paris, all the statues of kings had fallen, while that of Henry IV still
remained erect. It was for some time a matter of doubt whether it should be
pulled down. "The poem of the <i>Henriade</i> pleaded in its favour;" but, says
Mercier, "he was an ancestor of the perjured king," Then, and not till then,
this venerated statue underwent the same fate.</p>
<p>It has been generally believed that the deed of Ravaillac was dictated by
fanaticism, or that he was the instrument employed by the Marchioness of
Verneuil and the Duke of Epernon for assassinating that monarch. However, it
stands recorded, I am told, in a manuscript found in the National Library, that
Ravaillac killed Henry IV because he had seduced his sister, and abandoned her
when pregnant. Thus time, that affords a clue to most mysteries, has also
solved this historical enigma.</p>
<p>This statue of Henry IV was erected on the 23d of August, 1624. To have
insulted it, would, not long since, have been considered as a sacrilege; but,
after having been mutilated and trodden under foot, this once-revered image
found its way to the mint or the cannon-foundry. On its site now stands an
elegant coffeehouse, whence you may enjoy a fine view of the stately buildings
which adorn the quays that skirt the river.</p>
<p>While admiring the magnificence of this <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>, an
Englishman cannot avoid being struck by the multitude of washerwomen, striving
to expel the dirt from linen, by means of <i>battoirs</i>, or wooden
battledores. On each side of the Seine are to be seen some hundreds hard at
work, ranged in succession, along the sides of low barks, equal in length to
our west-country barges. Such is the vigour of their arm that, for the
circumference of half-a-mile, the air resounds with the noise of their
incessant blows. After beating the linen for some time in this merciless
manner, they scrub it with a hard brush, in lieu of soaping it, so that a shirt
which has passed through their hands five or six times is fit only for making
lint. No wonder then that Frenchmen, in general, wear coarse linen: a hop-sack
could not long resist so severe a process. However, it must be confessed, that
some good arises from this evil. These washerwomen insensibly contribute to the
diffusion of knowledge; for, as they are continually reducing linen into rags,
they cannot but considerably increase the supply, of that article for the
manufacture of paper.</p>
<p>Compared to the Thames, even above bridge, the Seine is far from exhibiting
a busy scene; a few rafts of wood for fuel, and some barges occasionally in
motion, now and then relieve the monotony of its rarely-ruffled surface. At
this moment, its navigation is impeded from its stream being swollen by the
late heavy rains. Hence much mischief is apprehended to the country lying
contiguous to its banks. Many parts of Paris are overflowed: in some streets
where carriages must pass, horses are up to their belly in water; while
pedestrians are under the necessity of availing themselves of the temporary
bridges, formed with tressels and planks, by the industrious Savoyards. The ill
consequences of this inundation are already felt, I assure you; being engaged
to dinner yesterday in the <i>Rue St. Florentin</i>, I was obliged to step into
a punt in order to reach the bottom of the stair-case; and what was infinitely
more mortifying to the master of the house, was that, the cellar being rendered
inaccessible,&mdash;he was deprived of the satisfaction of regaling his guests
with his best claret.</p>
<p>On the right hand side of the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, in crossing that bridge from
the <i>Quai de l'École</i> to the <i>Quai de Conti</i>, is a building, three
stories high, erected on piles, with its front standing between the first and
second arches. It is called</p>
<p class="center">LA SAMARITAINE.</p>
<p>Over the dial is a gilt group, representing Jesus Christ and the Samaritan
woman near Jacob's well, pourtrayed by a basin into which falls a sheet of
water issuing from a shell above. Under the basin is the following
inscription:</p>
<p class="bq">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Fons Hortorum<br />
Puteus aquarum viventium.</i><br />
</p>
<p>These words of the Gospel are here not unaptly applied to the destination of
this building, which is to furnish water to the garden of the <i>Tuileries</i>,
whose basins were not, on that account, the less dry half the year. The water
is raised by means of a pump, and afterwards distributed, by several conduits,
to the <i>Louvre</i> and the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, as well as to the
<i>Tuileries</i>.</p>
<p>In the middle, and above the arch, is a superstructure of timber-work faced
with gilt lead, where are the bells of the clock and those of chimes, which
ought to play every half-hour.</p>
<p>This tasteless edifice interrupts the view in every direction and as it is
far from being an ornament to the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, no one could now regret its
entire removal. Under the old <i>régime</i>, however, it was nothing less than
a government.</p>
<p>Among the functions of the governor, were included the care of the clock,
which scarcely ever told the hour, and that of the chimes, which were generally
out of order. When these chimes used to delight Henry IV, it is to be presumed
that they were kept in better tune. It was customary to make them play during
all public ceremonies, and especially when the king passed.</p>
<p>"The <i>Pont Neuf</i>, is in the city of Paris what the heart is in the
human body, the centre of motion and circulation: the flux and reflux of
inhabitants and strangers crowd this passage in such a manner, that, in order
to meet persons one is looking for, it is sufficient to walk here for an hour
every day. Here, the <i>mouchards</i>, or spies of the police, take their
station; and, when at the expiration of a few days, they see not their man,
they positively affirm that he is not in Paris."</p>
<p>Such was the animated picture of the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, as drawn by Mercier
in 1788, and such it really was before the revolution. At present, though this
bridge is sometimes thronged with passengers, it presents not, according to my
observation, that almost continual crowd and bustle for which it was formerly
distinguished. No stoppage now from the press of carriages of any description,
no difficulty in advancing quickly through the concourse of pedestrians.
Fruit-women, hucksters, hawkers, pedlars, indeed, together with ambulating
venders of lottery-tickets, and of <i>tisane</i>, crying "<i>à la fraiche!
Qui veut boire?</i>" here take their stand as they used, though not in such
numbers.</p>
<p>But the most sensible diminution is among the shoe-blacks, who stand in the
carriage-way, and, with all their implements before them, range themselves
along the edge of the very elevated <i>trottoir</i> or foot-pavement. The
<i>décrotteurs</i> of the <i>Pont Neuf</i> were once reputed masters of the
art: their foresight was equal to their dexterity and expedition. For the very
moderate sum of two <i>liards</i>, they enabled an abbé or a poet to present
himself in the gilded apartments of a dutchess. If it rained, or the rays of
the sun were uncommonly ardent, they put into his hand an umbrella to protect
the economy of his head-dress during the operation. Their great patrons have
disappeared, and, in lieu of a constant succession of customers, the few
<i>décrotteurs</i> who remain at their old-established station, are idle half
the day for want of employment.</p>
<p>These Savoyards generally practise more than one trade, as is indicated by
the <i>enseigne</i> which is affixed, on a short pole, above their
tool-box.</p>

</p>
<p>Change the name only, and such is, line for line, letter for letter, the
most ordinary style of their <i>annonce</i>. It is, however, to be presumed,
that the republican belles have adopted other favourites instead of dogs and
cats; for no longer is seen, as in the days of royalty, the aspiring or
favoured lover carrying his mistress's lap-dog in the public promenades. In
fact, the business of dog-shearing, &amp;c. seems full as dead in this part of
Paris as that of shoe-cleaning. The <i>artists</i> of the <i>Pont Neuf</i> are,
consequently, chop-fallen; and hilarity which formerly shone on their
countenance, is now succeeded by gloomy sadness.</p>
<p>At the foot of the <i>Pont Neuf</i> on the <i>Quai de la Féraille</i>
recruiting-officers used to unfurl their inviting banners, and neglect nothing
that art and cunning could devise to insnare the ignorant, the idle, and the
unwary. The means which they sometimes employed were no less whimsical than
various: the lover of wine was invited to a public-house, where he might
intoxicate himself; the glutton was tempted by the sight of ready-dressed
turkies, fowls, sausages &amp;c. suspended to a long pole; and the youth,
inclined to libertinism, was seduced by the meretricious allurements of a
well-tutored doxy. To second these man&oelig;uvres, the recruiter followed the
object of his prey with a bag of money, which he chinked occasionally, crying
out "<i>Qui en veut?</i>" and, in this manner, an army of heroes was completed.
It is almost superfluous to add, that the necessity of such stratagems is
obviated, by the present mode of raising soldiers by conscription.</p>
<p>Before we quit the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, I must relate to you an adventure
which, in the year 1786, happened to our friend P-----, who is now abroad, in a
situation of considerable trust and emolument. He was, at that time, a half-pay
subaltern in the British army, and visited Paris, as well from motives of
economy as from a desire of acquiring the French language. Being a tall,
fresh-coloured young man, as he was one day crossing the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, he
caught the eye of a recruiting-officer, who followed him from the <i>Quai de la
Féraille</i> to a coffee-house, in the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i>, which our
Englishman frequented for the sake of reading the London newspapers. The
recruiter, with all the art of a crimp combined with all the politeness of a
courtier, made up to him under pretence of having relations in England, and
endeavoured, by every means in his power, to insinuate himself into the good
graces of his new acquaintance. P----, by way of sport, encouraged the
eagerness of the recruiter, who lavished on him every sort of civility; peaches
in brandy, together with the choicest refreshments that a Parisian coffee-house
could afford, were offered to him and accepted: but not the smallest hint was
dropped of the motive of all this more than friendly attention. At length, the
recruiter, thinking that he might venture to break the ice, depicted, in the
most glowing colours, the pleasures and advantages of a military life, and
declared ingenuously that nothing would make him so happy as to have our
countryman P---- for his comrade. Without absolutely accepting or rejecting his
offer, P---- begged a little delay in order to consider of the matter, at the
same time hinting that there was; at that moment, a small obstacle to his
inclination. The recruiter, like a pioneer, promised to remove it, grasped his
hand with joy and exultation, and departed, singing a song of the same import
as that of Serjeant Kite:</p>
<p class="bq">
"Come brave boys, 'tis one to ten,<br />
But we return all gentlemen."<br />
</p>
<p>In a few days, the recruiter again met Mr. P---- at his accustomed
rendezvous; when, after treating him with coffee, liqueur, &amp;c. he came
directly to the point, but neglected not to introduce into his discourse every
persuasive allurement. P----, finding himself pushed home, reminded the
recruiter of the obstacle to which he had before alluded, and, to convince him
of its existence, put into his hand His Britannic Majesty's commission. The
astonishment and confusion of the French recruiter were so great that he was
unable to make any reply; but instantly retired, venting a tremendous
ejaculation.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let31f1">Footnote 1</a>: By the Plan of Paris, it will

<h2><a name="let32">LETTER XXXII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 13, 1801.</i></p>
<p>In this gay capital, balls succeed to balls in an almost incredible variety.
There are actually an immense number every evening; so that persons fond of the
amusement of dancing have full scope for the exercise of their talents in
Paris. It is no longer a matter of surprise to me that the French women dance
so well, since I find that they take frequent lessons from their master, and,
almost every night, they are at a dance of one kind or another. Added to this,
the same set of dances lasts the whole season, and go where you will, you have
a repetition of the same. However, this detracts not in the smallest degree;
from the merit of those Parisian belles who shine as first-rate dancers. The
mechanical part of the business, as Mr. C----g would call it, they may thus,
acquire by constant practice; but the decorative part, if I may so term the
fascinating grace which, they display in all their movements, is that the
result of study, or do they hold it from the bounteous hand of Nature?</p>
<p>While I am speaking of balls, I must inform you that, since the private ball
of which I gave you so circumstantial an account, I have been at several
others, also private, but of a different complexion; inasmuch as pleasure, not
profit, was the motive for which they were given, and the company was more
select; but, in point of general arrangement, I found them so like the former,
that I did not think it worth while to make any one of them the subject of a
distinct letter. In this line Madame Recamier takes the lead, but though her
balls are more splendid, those of Madame Soubiran are more agreeable. On the
21st of Frimaire, which was yesterday, I was at a public ball of the most
brilliant kind now known in Paris. It was the first of the subscription given
this season, and, from the name of the apartment where it is held, it is styled
the</p>
<p class="center">BAL DU SALON DES ÉTRANGERS.</p>
<p>Midnight is the general hour for the commencement of such diversions; but,
owing to the long train of carriages setting down company at this ball, it was
near two o'clock before I could arrive at the scene of action, in the <i>Rue
Grange Batelière</i>, near the Boulevards.</p>
<p>After I alighted and presented my ticket, some time elapsed before I could
squeeze into the room where the dancing was going forward. The spectators were
here so intermixed with the dancers, that they formed around them a border as
complete as a frame to a picture. It is astonishing that, under such
circumstances, a Parisian Terpsichore, far from being embarrassed, lays fresh
claim to your applause. With mathematical precision, she measures with her eye
the space to which she is restricted by the curiosity of the by-standers. Rapid
as lightning, she springs forward till the measure recalling her to the place
she left, she traces her orbit, like a planet, at the same time revolving on
her axis. Sometimes her "light, fantastic toe" will approach within half an
inch of your foot; nay, you shall almost feel her breath on your cheek, and
still she will not touch you, except, perhaps, with the skirt of her floating
tunic.</p>
<p>Among the female part of the company, I observed several lovely women; some,
who might have been taken for Asiatic sultanas, irradiating the space around
them by the dazzling brilliancy of their ornaments; others, without jewels, but
calling in every other aid of dress for the embellishment of their person; and
a few, rich in their native charms alone, verifying the expression of the poet.
Truth compels me to acknowledge that six or eight English ladies here were
totally eclipsed. For the honour of my country, I could have wished for a
better specimen of our excellence in female beauty. No women in the world, or
at least none that ever I have met with in the different quarters I have
visited, are handsomer than the English, in point of complexion and features.
This is a fact which Frenchmen themselves admit; but for grace, say they, our
countrywomen stand unrivalled, I am rather inclined to subscribe to this
opinion. In a well-educated French woman, there is an ease, an affability, a
desire to please and be pleased, which not only render her manners peculiarly
engaging, but also influence her gait, her gestures, her whole deportment in
short, and captivate admiration. Her natural cheerfulness and vivacity spread
over her features an animation seldom to be found in our English fair, whose
general characteristics are reserve and coldness. Hence that striking
expression which exhibits the grace of the French belles to superior
advantage.</p>
<p>Although my memory frequently disappoints me when I wish to retain names, I
have contrived to recollect those of three of the most remarkable women in the
ball-room. I shall therefore commit them to paper before I forget them. Madame
la Princesse de Santa-Croce displayed more diamonds than any of her
competitors; Mademoiselle Lescot was the best dancer among several ladies
renowned for dancing; and Madame Tallien was, on the whole, the handsomest
female that I saw in the room. There might possibly be women more beautiful
than she at this ball, but they did not come under my observation.</p>
<p>I had previously seen Madame Tallien at the <i>Opera Buffa</i>, and was
struck by her appearance before, I knew who she was. On seeing her again at the
<i>Salon des Étrangers</i>, I inquired of a French lady of my acquaintance,
whose understanding and discernment are pre-eminent, if Madame T------ had
nothing to recommend her but her personal attractions? The lady's answer is too
remarkable for me not to repeat it, which I will do <i>verbatim</i>. "In Madame
T------," said she, "beauty, wit, goodness of heart, grace, talents, all are
united. In a gay world, where malice subsists in all its force, her
inconsistencies alone have been talked of, without any mention being made of
the numerous acts of beneficence which have balanced, if they have not effaced,
her weakness. Would you believe," continued she, "that, in Paris, the grand
theatre of misconduct, where moral obligations are so much disregarded, where
we daily commit actions which we condemn in others; would you believe, that
Madame T------ experiences again and again the mortification of being deprived
of the society of this, or that woman who has nothing to boast of but her
depravity, and cannot plead one act of kindness, or even indulgence? This
picture is very dark," added she, "but the colouring is true."&mdash;"What you
tell me," observed I, "proves that, notwithstanding the irruption of
immorality, attributed to the revolution, it is still necessary for a woman to
preserve appearances at least, in order to be received here in what is termed
the best company."&mdash;"Yes, indeed," replied she; "if a woman neglects that
main point in Paris, she will soon find herself lowered in the opinion of the
fashionable world, and be at last excluded from even the secondary circles. In
London, your people of fashion are not quite so rigid."&mdash;"If a husband
chooses to wink at his wife's incontinence," rejoined I, "the world on our side
of the water is sufficiently complaisant to follow his example. Now with you,
character is made to depend more on the observance of etiquette; and,
certainly, hypocrisy, when detected, is of more prejudice to society than
barefaced profligacy."&mdash;The lady then resumed thus concerning the subject
of my inquiry. "Were some people to hear me," said she, "they might think that
I had drawn you a flattering portrait of Madame
T------ and say, by way of contrast, when the devil became old, he turned
hermit; but I should answer that, for some years, no twenty-four hours have
elapsed without persons, whom I could name on occasion, having begun their
daily career by going to see her, who saved their life, when, to accomplish
that object, she hazarded her own."</p>
<p>Here then is an additional instance of the noble energy manifested by women
during the most calamitous periods of the revolution. Unappalled by the terrors
of captivity or of death, their sensibility impelled them to brave the ferocity
of sanguinary tyrants, in order to administer hope or comfort to a parent, a
husband, a relation, or a friend. Some of these heroines, though in the bloom
of youth, not content with sympathizing in the misfortunes of others, gave
themselves up as a voluntary sacrifice, rather than survive those whose
preservation they valued more than their own existence. Rome may vaunt her
Porcia, or her Cornelia; but the page of her history can produce no such
exaltation of the female character as has been exhibited within the last ten
years by French women. Examples, like these, of generosity, fortitude, and
greatness of soul, deserve to be recorded to the end of time, as they do honour
to the sex, and to human nature.</p>
<p>If, according to the scale of Parisian enjoyment, a ball or rout is dull and
insipid, <i>à moins qu'on ne manque d'y être étouffé</i>, how supreme must have
been the satisfaction of the company at the <i>Salon des Étrangers!</i> The
number present, estimated at seven or eight hundred, occasioned so great a
crowd that it was by no means an easy enterprise to pass from one room to
another. Of course, there was no opportunity of viewing the apartments to
advantage; however, I saw enough of them to remark that they formed a suite
elegantly decorated. Some persons amused themselves with cards, though the
great majority neither played nor danced, but were occupied in conversing with
their acquaintance, There was no regular supper, but substantial refreshments
of every kind were to be procured on paying; and other smaller ones,
<i>gratis</i>.</p>
<p>From the tickets not being transferable, and the bearer's name being
inserted in each of them, the company was far more select than it could have
been without such a restriction. Most of the foreign ambassadors, envoys,
&amp;c. were present, and many of the most distinguished persons of both sexes
in Paris. More regard was paid to the etiquette of dress at this ball than, I
have ever witnessed here on similar occasions, The ladies, as I have before
said, were all <i>en grande toilette</i>; and the men with cocked hats, and in
shoes and stockings, which is a novelty here, I assure you, as they mostly
appear in boots. But what surprised me not a little, was to observe several
inconsiderate French youths wear black cockades. Should they persist in such an
absurdity, I shall be still more surprised, if they escape admonition from the
police. This fashion seemed to be the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of the moment; it was
never before exhibited in public, and probably will be but of ephemeral
duration.</p>
<p>I cannot take leave of this ball without communicating to you a circumstance
which occurred there, and which, from the extravagant credulity it exhibits in
regard to the effects of sympathy, may possibly amuse you for a moment.</p>
<p>A widow, about twenty years of age, more to be admired for the symmetry of
her person, than for the beauty of her features, had, according to the
prevailing custom, intrusted her pocket-handkerchief to the care of a male
friend, a gentlemanlike young Frenchman of my acquaintance. After dancing, the
lady finding herself rather warm, applied for her handkerchief, with which she
wiped her forehead, and returned it to the gentleman, who again put it into his
pocket. He then danced, but not with her; and, being also heated, he, by
mistake, took out the lady's handkerchief, which, when applied to his face,
produced, as he fancied, such an effect on him, that, though he had previously
regarded her with a sort of indifference, from that moment she engaged all his
attention, and he was unable to direct his eyes, or even his thoughts, to any
other object.</p>
<p>Some philosophers, as is well known, have maintained that from all bodies
there is an emanation of corpuscles, which, coming into contact with our
organs, make on the brain an impression, either more or less sympathetic, or of
a directly-opposite nature. They tell you, for instance, that of two women whom
you behold for the first time, the one the least handsome will sometimes please
you most, because there exists a greater <i>sympathy</i> between you and her,
than between you and the more beautiful woman. Without attempting to refute
this absurd doctrine of corpuscles, I shall only observe that this young
Frenchman is completely smitten, and declares that no woman in the world can be
compared to the widow.</p>
<p>This circumstance reminds me of a still more remarkable effect, ascribed to
a similar cause, experienced by Henry III of France. The marriage of the king
of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV, with Marguerite de Valois, and that of the
Prince de Condé with Marie de Cleves, was celebrated at the Louvre on the 10th
of August, 1572. Marie de Cleves, then a most lovely creature only sixteen,
after dancing much, finding herself incommoded by the heat of the ball-room,
retired to a private apartment, where one of the waiting-women of the
queen-dowager, seeing her in a profuse perspiration, persuaded her to make an
entire change of dress. She had scarcely left the room when the Duke of Anjou,
afterwards Henry III, who had also danced a great deal, entered it to adjust
his hair, and, being overheated, wiped his face with the first thing that he
found, which happened to be the shift she had just taken off. Returning to the
ball, he fixed his eyes on her, and contemplated her with as much surprise as
if he had never before beheld her. His emotion, his transports, and the
attention which he began to pay her, were the more extraordinary, as during the
preceding week, which she had passed at court, he appeared indifferent to those
very charms which now made on his heart an impression so warm and so lasting.
In short, he became insensible to every thing that did not relate to his
passion.</p>
<p>His election to the crown of Poland, say historians, far from flattering
him, appeared to him an exile, and when he was in that kingdom, absence, far
from diminishing his love, seemed to increase it. Whenever he addressed the
princess, he pricked his finger, and never wrote to her but with his blood. No
sooner was he informed of the death of Charles IX, than he dispatched a courier
to assure her that she should soon be queen of France; and, on his return, his
thoughts were solely bent on dissolving her marriage with the Prince de Condé,
which, on account of the latter being a protestant, he expected to accomplish.
But this determination proved fatal to the princess; for, shortly after, she
was attacked by a violent illness, attributed to poison, which carried her off
in the flower of her age.</p>
<p>No words can paint Henry's despair at this event: he passed several days in
tears and groans; and when he was at length obliged to shew himself in public,
he appeared in deep mourning, and entirely covered with emblems of death, even
to his very shoe-strings.</p>
<p>The Princess de Condé had been dead upwards of four months, and buried in
the abbey-church of <i>St. Germain-des-Prés</i>, when Henry, on entering the
abbey, whither he was invited to a grand entertainment given there by Cardinal
de Bourbon, felt such violent tremblings at his heart, that not being able to
endure their continuance, he was going away; but they ceased all at once, on
the body of the princess being removed from its tomb, and conveyed elsewhere
for that evening.</p>
<p>His mother, Catherine de Medicis, by prevailing on him to marry Louise de
Vaudemont, one of the most beautiful women in Europe, hoped that she would make
him forget her whom death had snatched from him, and he himself perhaps
indulged a similar hope, but the memoirs of those times concur in asserting
that the image of the Princess de Condé was never effaced from his heart, and
that, to the day of his assassination, which did not happen till seventeen
years after, whatever efforts he made to subdue his passion, were wholly
unavailing.</p>
<p>Sympathy is a sentiment to which few persons attach the same ideas. It may
be classed in three distinct species. The first seems to have an immediate
connexion with the senses; the second, with the heart; and the third, with the
mind. Although it cannot be denied that the preference we bestow on this or
that woman is the result of the one or the other of these, or even of all three
together; yet the analysis of our attachments is, in some cases, so difficult
as to defy the investigation of reason. For, as the old song says, some
lovers</p>
<p class="bq">
Will "whimper and whine<br />
For lilies and roses,<br />
For eyes, lips, and noses,<br />
Or a <i>tip of an ear</i>."<br />
</p>
<p>To cut the matter short, I think it fully proved, by the example of some of
the wisest men, that the affections are often captivated by something
indefinable, or, in the words of Corneille,</p>
<p class="center"><i>"Par un je ne sais quoi&mdash;qu'on ne peut
exprimer."</i></p>
<h2><a name="let32">LETTER XXXIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 14, 1801.</i></p>
<p>I have already spoken to you of the <i>Pont Neuf</i>. To the east of it, as
you will see by the Plan of Paris, the small islands in the middle of the Seine
are connected to its banks by several bridges; while to the west, there are two
only, though a third is projected, and, previously to the late rise of the
river, workmen were employed in driving piles for the foundation. I shall now
describe to you these two bridges, beginning with the</p>
<p class="center">PONT NATIONAL.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, this bridge bore the appellation of <i>Pont
Royal</i>, from its having been built by Lewis XIV, and the expenses defrayed
but of his privy purse, to supply the place of one of wood, situated opposite
to the <i>Louvre</i>, which was carried away by the ice in 1684. It is reckoned
one of the most solid bridges in Paris, and, till the existence of the <i>Pont
de la Concorde</i>, was the only one built across the river, without taking
advantage of the islands above-mentioned. It stands on four piles, forming with
the two abutments five elliptical arches of a handsome sweep. The span of the
centre arch is seventy-two feet, that of the two adjoining sixty-six, and that
of the two outer ones sixty. On each side is a raised pavement for
foot-passengers, in the middle of which I should imagine that there is breadth
sufficient to admit of four carriages passing abreast.</p>
<p>GABRIEL had undertaken this bridge from the designs of MANSARD. The work was
already in a state of forwardness, when, at a pile on the side of the
<i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, the former could not succeed in excluding the
water. A Jacobin, not a clubist, but a Jacobin friar, one FRANÇOIS ROMAIN, who
had just finished the bridge of Strasburg, was sent for by the king to the
assistance of the French architects, and had the honour of completing the rest
of the work.</p>
<p>In the time of Henry IV, there was no bridge over this part of the river,
which he used frequently to cross in the first boat that presented itself.
Returning one day from the chace, in a plain hunting dress, and having with him
only two or three gentlemen, he stepped into a skiff to be carried over from
the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i> to the <i>Tuileries</i>. Perceiving that he was
not known by the waterman, he asked him what people said of the peace, meaning
the peace of Vervins, which was just concluded. "Faith! I don't understand this
sort of peace," answered the waterman; "there are taxes on every thing, and
even, on this miserable boat, with which I have a hard matter to earn my
bread."&mdash;"And does not the king," continued Henry, "intend to lighten
these taxes?"&mdash;"The king is a good kind of man enough," replied the
waterman; "but he has a lady who must needs have so many fine gowns and
gewgaws; and 'tis we who pay for all that. One would not think so much of it
either, if she kept to him only; but, they say, she suffers herself to be
kissed by many others."</p>
<p>Henry IV was so amused by this conversation, that, the next morning, he sent
for the waterman, and made him repeat, word for word, before the Dutchess of
Beaufort, all that he had said the preceding evening. The Dutchess, much
irritated, was for having him hanged. "You are a foolish woman," said Henry;
"this is a poor devil whom poverty has put out of humour. In future, he shall
pay no tax for his boat, and I am convinced that he will then sing every day,
<i>Vive Henri! Vive Gabrielle!</i>"</p>
<p>The north end of the <i>Pont National</i> faces the wing of the palace of
the <i>Tuileries</i> distinguished by the name of the <i>Pavillon de Flore</i>.
From the middle of this bridge, you see the city in a striking point of view.
Here, the celebrated Marshal de Catinat used frequently to make it part of his
morning's amusement to take his stand, and, while he enjoyed the beauty of the
prospect, he opened his purse to the indigent as they passed. That philosophic
warrior often declared that he never beheld any thing equal to the <i>coup
d'&oelig;il</i> from this station. In fact, on the one side, you discover the
superb gallery of the <i>Louvre</i>, extending from that palace to the
<i>Tuileries</i>; and, on the other, the <i>Palais du Corps Législatif</i>, and
a long range of other magnificent buildings, skirting the quays on each bank of
the river.</p>
<p>These quays, nearly to the number of thirty, are faced with stone, and
crowned with parapets breast high, which, in eighteen or twenty different
spots, open to form watering-places. The Seine, being thus confined within its
bed, the eye is never displeased here by the sight of muddy banks like those of
the Thames, or the nose offended by the smell arising from the filth which the
common sewers convey to the river.</p>
<p>The galiot of <i>St. Cloud</i> regularly takes its departure from the
<i>Pont National</i>. Formerly, on Sundays and holidays, it used to be a very
entertaining sight to contemplate the Paris cocknies crowding into this vessel.
Those who arrived too late, jumped into the first empty boat, which frequently
overset, either through the unskilfulness of the waterman, or from being
overloaded. In consequence of such accidents, the boats of the Seine are
prohibited from taking more than sixteen passengers.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, an excursion to <i>St. Cloud</i> by water, was an
important voyage to some of the Parisians, as you may see by referring to the
picture which has been drawn of it, under the title of "<i>Voyage de Paris à
Saint Cloud par mer, et le retour de Saint Cloud à Paris par terre</i>."</p>
<p>Following the banks of the Seine, towards the west, we next come to the</p>
<p class="center">PONT DE LA CONCORDE.</p>
<p>This bridge, which had long been wished for and projected, was begun in
1787, and finished in 1790. Its southern extremity stands opposite to the
<i>Palais du Corps Législatif</i>; while that of the north faces the <i>Place
de la Concorde</i>, whence it not only derives its present appellation, but has
always experienced every change of name to which the former has been
subject.</p>
<p>The lightness of its apearance is less striking to those who have seen the
<i>Pont de Neuilly</i>, in which PERRONET, Engineer of bridges and highways,
has, by the construction of arches nearly flat, so eminently distinguished
himself. He is likewise the architect of this bridge, which is four hundred and
sixty-two feet in length by forty-eight in breadth. Like the <i>Pont
National</i>, it consists of five elliptical arches. The span of the centre
arch is ninety-six feet; that of the collateral ones, eighty-seven; and that of
the two others near the abutments, sixty-eight. Under one of the latter is a
tracking-path for the facility of navigation.</p>
<p>The piles, which are each nine feet in thickness, have, on their starlings,
a species of pillars that support a cornice five feet and a half high.
Perpendicularly to these pillars are to rise as many pyramids, which are to be
crowned by a parapet with a balustrade: in all these, it is intended to display
no less elegance of workmanship than the arches present boldness of design and
correctness of execution.</p>
<p>On crossing these bridges, it has often occurred to me, how much the
Parisians must envy us the situation of our metropolis. If the Seine, like the
Thames, presented the advantage of braving the moderate winds, and of
conveying, by regular tides, the productions of the four quarters of the globe
to the quays which skirt its banks, what an acquisition would it not be to
their puny commerce! What a gratification to their pride to see ships
discharging their rich cargoes at the foot of the <i>Pont de la Concorde!</i>
The project of the canal of Languedoc must, at first, have apparently presented
greater obstacles; yet, by talents and perseverance, these were overcome at a
time when the science of machinery of every description was far less understood
than it is at the present moment.</p>
<p>It appears from the account of Abbon, a monk of the abbey of St.
Germain-des-Prés, that, in the year 885, the Swedes, Danes, and Normans, to the
number of forty-five thousand men, came to lay siege to Paris, with seven
hundred sail of ships, exclusively of the smaller craft, so that, according to
this historian, who was an eye-witness of the fact, the river Seine was covered
with their vessels for the space of two leagues.</p>
<p>Julius Cæsar tells us, in the third book of his Commentaries, that, at the
time of his conquest of the Gauls, in the course of one winter, he constructed
six hundred vessels of the wood which then grew in the environs of Paris; and
that, in the following spring, he embarked his army, horse and foot, provisions
and baggage, in these vessels, descended the Seine, reached Dieppe, and thence
crossed over to England, of which, he says, he made a conquest.</p>
<p>About forty years ago, the scheme engaged much attention. In 1759, the
Academy of Sciences, Belles-Lettres, and Arts of Rouen, proposed the following
as a prize-question: "Was not the Seine formerly navigable for vessels of
greater burden than those which are now employed on it; and are there not means
to restore to it, or to procure it, that advantage?" In 1760, the prize was
adjourned; the memoirs presented not being to the satisfaction of the Academy.
In 1761, the new candidates having no better success, the subject was
changed.</p>
<p>However, notwithstanding this discouragement, we find that, on the 1st of
August, 1766, Captain Berthelot actually reached the <i>Pont Royal</i> in a
vessel of one hundred and sixty tons burden. When, on the 22d of the same
month, he departed thence, loaded with merchandise, the depth of the water in
the Seine was twenty-five feet, and it was nearly the same when he ascended the
river. This vessel was seven days on her passage from Rouen to Paris: but a
year or two ago, four days only were employed in performing the same voyage by
another vessel, named the <i>Saumon</i>.</p>
<p>Engineers have ever judged the scheme practicable, and the estimate of the
necessary works, signed by several skilful surveyors, was submitted to the
ministry of that day. The amount was forty-six millions of livres (circa
£1,916,600 sterling).</p>
<p>But what can compensate for the absence of the tide? This is an advantage,
which, in a commercial point of view, must ever insure to London a decided
superiority over Paris. Were the Seine to-morrow rendered navigable for vessels
of large burden, they must, for a considerable distance, be tracked against the
stream, or wait till a succession of favourable winds had enabled them to stem
it through its various windings; whereas nothing can be more favourable to
navigation than the position of London. It has every advantage of a sea-port
without its dangers. Had it been placed lower down, that is, nearer to the
mouth of the Thames, it would have been more exposed to the insults of a
foreign enemy, and also to the insalubrious exhalations of the swampy marshes.
Had it been situated higher up the river, it would have been inaccessible to
ships of large burden.</p>
<p>Thus, by no effort of human invention or industry can Paris rival London in
commerce, even on the supposition that France could produce as many men
possessed of the capital and spirit of enterprise, for which our British
merchants are at present unrivalled.</p>
<p>Yet, may not this pre-eminence in commercial prosperity lead to our
destruction, as the gigantic conquests of France may also pave the way to her
ruin? Alas! the experience of ages proves this melancholy truth, which has also
been repeated by Raynal: "Commerce," says that celebrated writer, "in the end
finds its ruin in the riches which it accumulates, as every powerful state lays
the foundation of its own destruction in extending its conquests."</p>
<h2><a name="let34">LETTER XXXIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 16, 1801.</i></p>
<p>No part of the engagement into which I have entered with you, so fully
convinces me of my want of reflection, and shews that my zeal, at the time, got
the better of my judgment, as my promising you some ideas on</p>
<p class="center">FRENCH LITERATURE.</p>
<p>It would, I now perceive, be necessary to have inhabited France for several
years past, with the determined intention of observing this great empire solely
in that single point of view, to be able to keep my word in a manner worthy of
you and of the subject. It would be necessary to write a large volume of
rational things; and, in a letter, I ought to relate them with conciseness and
truth; draw sketches with rapidity, but clearness; in short, express positive
results, without deviating from abstractions and generalities, since you
require from me, on this subject, no more than a letter, and not a book.</p>
<p>I come to the point. I shall consider literature in a double sense. First,
the thing in itself; then, its connexions with the sciences, and the men who
govern. In England, it has been thought, or at least insinuated in some of the
papers and periodical publications, that literature had been totally
annihilated in France within the last twelve years. This is a mistake: its
aberrations have been taken for eclipses. It has followed the revolution
through all its phases.</p>
<p>Under the Constituent Assembly, the literary genius of the French was turned
towards politics and eloquence. There remain valuable monuments of the fleeting
existence of that assembly. MIRABEAU, BARNAVE, CAZALÈS, MAURY, and thirty other
capital writers, attest this truth. Nothing fell from their lips or their pen
that did not hear at the same time the stamp of philosophy and literature.</p>
<p>Under the Legislative Assembly and the Convention, the establishments of the
empire of letters were little respected. Literati themselves became victims of
the political collisions of their country; but literature was constantly
cultivated under several forms. Those who shewed themselves its oppressors,
were obliged to assume the refined language which it alone can supply, and
that, at the very time when they declared war against it.</p>
<p>Under the Directorial government, France, overwhelmed by the weight of her
long misfortunes, first cast her eye on the construction of a new edifice,
dedicated to human knowledge in general, under the name of <i>National
Institute</i>. Literature there collected its remains, and those who cultivate
it, as members of this establishment, are not unworthy of their office. Such as
are not admitted into this society, notwithstanding all the claims the most
generally acknowledged, owe this omission to moral or political causes only, on
which I could not touch, without occupying myself about persons rather than the
thing itself.</p>
<p>The French revolution, which has levelled so many gigantic fortunes, is said
(by its advocates) to have really spread a degree of comfort among the inferior
classes. Indeed, if there are in France, as may be supposed, much fewer persons
rolling in riches, there are, I am informed, much fewer pining in indigence.
This observation, admitting it to be strictly true, may, with great propriety,
be applied to French literature. France no longer has a VOLTAIRE or a ROUSSEAU,
to wield the sceptre of the literary world; but she has a number of literary
degrees of public interest or simple amusement, which are perfectly well
filled. Few literati are without employ, and still fewer are beneath their
functions. The place of member of the Institute is a real public function
remunerated by the State. It is to this cause, and to a few others, which will
occur to you beforehand, that we must attribute the character of gravity which
literature begins to assume in this country. The prudery of the school of DORAT
would here be hissed. Here, people will not quarrel with the Graces; but they
will no longer make any sacrifice to them at the expense of common sense.</p>
<p>In this literary republic still exist, as you may well conceive, the same
passions, the same littleness, the same intrigues as formerly for arriving at
celebrity, and keeping in that envied sphere; but all this makes much less
noise at the present juncture. It is this which has induced the belief that
literature had diminished its intensity, both in form and object: that is
another mistake. The French literati are mostly a noisy class, who love to make
themselves conspicuous, even by the clashing of their pretensions; but, to the
great regret of several among them, people in this country now attach a
rational importance only to their quarrels, which formerly attracted universal
attention. The revolution has been so great an event; it has overthrown such
great interests; that no one here can any longer flatter himself with exciting
a personal interest, except by performing the greatest actions.</p>
<p>I must also make a decisive confession on this matter, and acknowledge that
literature, which formerly held the first degree in the scale of the moral
riches of this nation, is likely to decline in priority and influence. The
sciences have claimed and obtained in the public mind a superiority resulting
from the very nature of their object; I mean utility. The title of
<i>savant</i> is not more brilliant than formerly; but it is more imposing; it
leads to consequence, to superior employments, and, above all, to riches. The
sciences have done so much for this people during their revolution, that,
whether through instinct, or premeditated gratitude, they have declared their
partiality towards the <i>savans</i>, or men of science, to the detriment of
the mere literati. The sciences are nearly allied both to pride and national
interest; while literature concerns only the vanity and interest of a few
individuals. This difference must have been felt, and of itself alone have
fixed the esteem of the public, and graduated their suffrages according to the
merit of the objects. Regard being had to their specific importance, I foresee
that this natural classification will be attended with happy consequences, both
for sciences and literature.</p>
<p>I have been enabled to observe that very few men of science are unacquainted
with the literature of their country, whether for seeking in it pleasing
relaxation, or for borrowing from it a magic style, a fluent elocution, a
harmony, a pomp of expression, with which the most abstract meditations can no
longer dispense to be received favourably by philosophers and men of taste.
Very few literati, on the other hand, are unacquainted with philosophy and the
sciences, and, above all, with natural knowledge; whether not to be too much in
arrear with the age in which they live, and which evidently inclines to the
study of Nature, or to give more colour and consistence to their thoughts, by
multiplying their degrees of comparison with the eternal type of all that is
great and fertile.</p>
<p>It has been so often repeated that HOMER, OSSIAN, and MILTON, knew every
thing known in their times; that they were at once the greatest natural
philosophers and the best moralists of their age, that this truth has made an
impression on most of the adepts in literature; and as the impulse is given,
and the education of the present day by the retrenchment of several unnecessary
pursuits, has left, in the mind of the rising generation, vacancies fit to be
filled by a great variety of useful acquirements, it appears to me
demonstrated, on following analogy, and the gradations of human improvement,
that the sciences, philosophy, and literature will some day have in France but
one common domain, as they there have at present, with the arts, only one
central point of junction.</p>
<p>The French government has flattered the literati and artists, by calling
them in great numbers round it and its ministers, either to give their advice
in matters of taste, or to serve as a decoration to its power, and an
additional lustre to the crown of glory with which it is endeavouring to
encircle itself; but, in general, the palpable, substantial, and solid
distinctions have been reserved for men of science, chymists, naturalists, and
mathematicians: they have seats in the Senate, in the Tribunate, in the Council
of State, and in all the Administrations; while LAHARPE, the veteran of French
literature, is not even a member of the Institute, and is reduced to give
lessons, which are, undoubtedly, not only very interesting to the public, but
also very profitable to himself, and produce him as much money, at least, as
his knowledge has acquired him reputation.</p>
<p>It results from what I have said, that French literature has not experienced
any apparent injury from the revolutionary storm: it has only changed its
direction and means: it has still remaining talents which have served their
time, talents in their maturity, and talents in a state of probation, and of
much promise.</p>
<p>Persons of reflection entertain great hopes from the violent shock given to
men's minds by the revolution; from that silent inquietude still working in
their hearts; from that sap, full of life, circulating with rapidity through
this body politic. "The factions are muzzled," say they; "but the factious
spirit still ferments under the curb of power; if means can be found to force
it to evaporate on objects which belong to the domain of illusion and
sensibility, the result will prove a great blessing to France, by carrying back
to the arts and to literature, and even to commerce, that exuberance of heat
and activity which can no longer be employed without danger on political
subjects."</p>
<p>The same men, whom I have just pointed out, affirm that England herself will
feel, in her literary and scientific system, a salutary concussion from the
direction given here to the public mind. They expect with impatience that the
British government will engage in some great measure of public utility, in
order that the rivalship subsisting between the two nations on political and
military points, which have no longer any object, may soon become, in France,
the most active and most powerful vehicle for different parts of her interior
improvement.</p>
<p>Of all kinds of literature, <i>Epic Poetry</i> is the only one in which
France has not obtained such success as to place her on a level with TASSO and
MILTON. To make amends, her poets have followed with advantage the steps of
ARIOSTO, without being able to surpass him. From this school have issued two
modern epic poems: <i>La guerre des dieux payens contre les dieux
chretiens</i>, by PARNY and <i>La conquête de Naples</i>, by GUDIN. The former
is distinguished by an easy versification, and an imagination jocose and
fertile, though, certainly, far too licentious. Educated in the school of
DORAT, he possesses his redundance and grace, without his fatuity. His elegies
are worthy of TIBULLUS; and his fugitive pieces are at once dictated by wit and
sentiment: thus it was that CHAULIEU wrote, but with more negligence. The
latter has thought to compensate for the energy and grace that should give life
to his subject (which he considers only in a playful and satirical light), by a
truly tiresome multitude of incidents. Conceive three huge volumes in octavo,
for a poem which required but one of a moderate size, and, in them, a
versification frequently negligent. These are two serious faults, which the
French will not readily overlook. No where are critics more severe, on the one
hand, against redundance that is steril, and on the other, respecting the
essential composition of verse, which ought always to flow with grace, even
when under restraint. Catholicism, however, has no more reason to be pleased
with the loose scenes presented in this work, than christianity, in general,
has with the licentious pictures of PARNY; but GUDIN is far less dangerous to
Rome, because he will be less read.</p>
<p>Several authors have devoted their labours to <i>Tragedy</i>, during the
course of the revolution. CHÉNIER has produced a whole theatre, which will
remain to posterity, notwithstanding his faults, as he has contrived to cover
them with beauties. ARNAULT and MERCIER of Compiegne are two young authors that
seem to have been educated in the school of DUCIS, who is at this day the
father of all the present tragic writers. The pieces which they have produced
have met with some success, and are of considerable promise.</p>
<p><i>Comedy</i> lost a vigorous supporter under the tyranny of ROBESPIERRE.
This was FABRE D'EGLANTINE. That poet seldom failed of success, drew none but
bold characters, and placed himself, by his own merit, between MOLIÈRE and
DESTOUCHES. COLIN D'HARLEVILLE and LEGOUVÉ produce agreeable pieces which
succeed. They paint, with an easy and graceful pencil, the absurdities and
humours of society; but their pieces are deficient in plot and action. FABRÉ
D'EGLANTINE pourtrayed, in striking colours, those frightful vices which are
beyond the reach of the law. His pieces are strongly woven and easily
unravelled. PICARD seems to have taken GOLDONI, the celebrated Venetian comic
writer, for his model. Like him, an excellent painter, a writer by impulse, he
produces, with wonderful fecundity, a number of interesting comedies, which
make the audience laugh till they shed tears, and how and then give great
lessons. PALISSOT, CAILHAVA, and MERCIER are still living; but no longer
produce any thing striking.</p>
<p>I shall say little of French eloquence. Under the new form of government,
orators have less opportunity and less scope for displaying transscendant
talents than during the first years of the revolution. Two members of the
government, CAMBACÉRÈS and LEBRUN, have distinguished themselves in this career
by close, logical argument, bright conceptions, and discriminating genius.
BENJAMIN CONSTANT and GUINGUÉNÉ, members of the Tribunate, shewed themselves to
advantage last year, as I understand, in some productions full of energy and
wisdom. DEMEUNIER and BOISSI D'ANGLAS are already, in the Tribunate, veterans
of eloquence; but the man who unites, in this respect, all the approbation of
that body, and even of France, is DAUNOU. In exterior means he is deficient;
but his thoughts proceed at once from a warm heart and an open mind, guided by
a superior genius; and his expressions manifest the source from which they
flow.</p>
<p>Several capital works of the historic kind have made their appearance in
France within the last ten years; but, with the exception of those of
celebrated voyagers or travellers, such as LA PÉROUSE, BAUDIN, SONNINI,
LABILLARDIÈRE, OLIVIER, ANDRÉ MICHAUD, &amp;c. those whose object has been to
treat of the arts, sciences, and manners of Greece, such as the travels of
Anacharsis, of Pythagoras, or of Antenor; those whose subject has not been
confined to France, such as the <i>Précis de l'histoire générale</i>, by
ANQUETIL; people ought to be on their guard against the merit even of
productions written mediately or immediately on the revolution, its causes, and
consequences. The passions are not yet sufficiently calmed for us not to
suspect the spirit of party to interpose itself between men and truth. The most
splendid talents are frequently in this line only the most faithless guide. It
is affirmed, however, that there are a few works which recommend themselves, by
the most philosophic impartiality; but none of these have as yet fallen under
my observation. A striking production is expected from the pen of the
celebrated VOLNEY. This is a <i>Tableau Physique des États Unis</i>; but it is
with regret I hear that its appearance is delayed by the author's
indisposition.</p>
<p><i>Novels</i> are born and die here, as among us, with astonishing
abundance. The rage for evocations and magic spectres begins to diminish. The
French assert that they have borrowed it from us, and from the school of MRS.
RADCLIFF, &amp;c. &amp;c. They also assert, that the policy of the
royalist-party was not unconnected with this propagation of cavernous,
cadaverous adventures, ideas, and illusions, intended, they say, by the
impression of a new moral terror to infatuate their countrymen again with the
dull and soporific prestiges of popery. They see with joy that the taste for
pleasure has assumed the ascendency, at least in Paris, and that novels in the
English style no longer make any one tremble, at night by the fireside, but the
old beldams of the provincial departments.</p>
<p>The less important kinds of literature, such as the <i>Apologue</i> or
<i>Moral Fable</i>, which is not at this day much in fashion; the
<i>Eclogue</i> or <i>Idyl</i>, whose culture particularly belongs to agrestical
and picturesque regions; <i>Political Satire</i>, which is never more refined
than under the influence of arbitrary power; these kinds, to which I might add
the <i>Madrigal</i> and <i>Epigram</i>, without being altogether abandoned, are
not generally enough cultivated here to obtain special mention. I shall make an
exception only in favour of the pastoral poems of LECLERC (of Marne and Loire)
of which I have heard a very favourable account.</p>
<p>At the end of a revolution which has had periods so ensanguined,
<i>Romance</i>, (romantic poetry) must have been cultivated and held in
request. It has been so, especially by sentimental minds, and not a little too
through the spirit of party; this was likely to be the case, since its most
affecting characteristic is to mourn over tombs.</p>
<p><i>Lyric poetry</i> has been carried by LEBRUN, CHÉNIER, &amp;c. to a height
worthy of JEAN BAPTISTE ROUSSEAU. The former, above all, will stand his ground,
by his weight, to the latest posterity; while hitherto the lyric productions of
CHÉNIER have not been able to dispense with the charm of musical harmony.
FONTANES, CUBIÈRES, PONS DE VERDUN, BAOUR-LORNIAN, and DESPAZE are secondary
geniuses, who do not make us forget that DELISLE and the Chevalier BERTIN are
still living; but whose fugitive pieces sometimes display many charms.</p>
<p>When you shall be made acquainted that Paris, of all the cities in the
world, is that where the rage for dancing is the most <i>nationalized</i>,
where, from the gilded apartments of the most fashionable quarters to the smoky
chambers of the most obscure suburbs, there are executed more capers in
cadence, than in any other place on earth, you will not be surprised if I
reserve a special article for one of the kinds of literature that bears the
most affinity to this distinctive diversion of the Parisian belles, which has
led MERCIER to say, that their city was the <i>guingette</i> of Europe; I mean
<i>Song</i>. Perhaps, a subject new and curious to treat on, would be the
influence of vocal music on the French revolution. Every one knows that this
people marched to battle singing; but, independently of the subject being above
my abilities, it would carry me too far beyond the limited plan which I have
prescribed to myself.</p>
<p>Let it suffice for you to know, that there has existed in Paris a sort of
lyric manufactory, which, under the name of "<i>Diners du vaudeville</i>"
scrupulously performed, for several years, an engagement to furnish, every
month, a collection of songs very agreeable and very captivating. These
productions are pretty often full of allusions, more or less veiled, to the
political events of the moment; seldom, however, have they been handled as very
offensive weapons against persons or institutions. The friends of mirth and
wine are seldom dark and dangerous politicians. This country possesses a great
number of them, who combine the talents required by the gravest magistracy with
all the levity of the most witty and most cheerful <i>bon vivant</i>. I shall
quote at random FRANÇOIS DE NEUFCHÂTEAU, the two SÉGURS, PIIS, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Others, such as BARRÉ, DESFONTAINES, and RADET, confine themselves to their
exclusive functions of professed song-makers, and write only for the little
musical theatres, or for the leisure of their countrymen and their
evening-amusements.</p>
<p>It is impossible to terminate a sketch of the literature of France, without
saying a word of such of the <i>Journals</i> as I have yet perused, which are
specially devoted to it. The <i>Mercure de France</i> is one of those held in
most esteem; and habit, as well as the spirit of party, concurs in making the
fortune of this journal. There exists another, conducted by a member of the
Institute, named POUGENS, under the title of <i>Bibliothèque Française</i>,
which is spoken of very favourably. But that which appears every ten days,
under the name of <i>Décade Philosophique</i>, is the best production of the
sort. A society of literary men, prudent, well-informed, and warmly attached to
their country, are its authors, and deposit in it a well-digested analysis of
every thing new that appears in the arts, sciences, or literature.
Nevertheless, a labour so carefully performed, is perfectly disinterested. This
is the only enterprise of the kind that does not afford a livelihood to its
associates, and is supported by a zeal altogether gratuitous.</p>
<p>Without seeking to blame or approve the title of this last-mentioned
journal, I shall only remark that the word <i>Décade</i>, coupled with the word
<i>Philosophique</i>, becomes in the eyes of many persons a double cause of
reprobation; and that, at this day, more than ever, those two words are, in the
opinion the most in fashion, marked by a proscription that is reflected on
every thing which belongs to the science of philosophy.</p>
<p>This would be the moment to inquire into the secret or ostensible causes
which have led to the retrograde course that is to be remarked in France in the
ideas which have been hitherto reckoned as conducive to the advancement of
reason. This would be the moment to observe the new government of France
endeavouring to balance, the one by the other, the opinions sprung from the
Republic, and those daily conjured up from the Monarchy; holding in
<i>equilibrio</i> two colours of doctrines so diametrically opposite, and
consequently two parties equally dissatisfied at not being able to crush each
other, <i>neutralizing</i> them, in short, by its immense influence in the
employment of their strength, when they bewilder or exhaust themselves
uselessly for its interests; but I could not touch on these matters, without
travelling out of the domain of literature, which is the only one that is at
present familiar to me, in order to enter into yours, where you have not
leisure to direct me; and you may conceive with what an ill grace I should
appear, in making before you, in politics, excursions, which, probably, would
have for me the inconvenience of commanding great efforts, without leaving me
the hope of adding any thing to your stock of information.</p>
<h2><a name="let35">LETTER XXXV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 18, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Divided as Paris is by the Seine, it seldom happens that one has not
occasion to cross it more than once in the course of the day. I shall therefore
make you acquainted with the bridges which connect to its banks the islands
situated in that part of the river I have not yet described. Being out of my
general track, I might otherwise forget to make any further mention of them,
which would be a manifest omission, now you have before you the Plan of
Paris.</p>
<p>We will also embrace the opportunity of visiting the <i>Palais de
Justice</i> and the Cathedral of <i>Notre-Dame</i>. East of the
<i>Pont-Neuf</i>, we first arrive at the</p>
<p class="center">PONT AU CHANGE.</p>
<p>This bridge, which leads from the north bank of the Seine to the <i>Ile du
Palais</i>, is one of the most ancient in Paris. Though, like all those of
which I have now to speak, it crosses but one channel of the river, it was
called the <i>Grand Pont</i>, till the year 1141, when it acquired its present
name on Lewis VII establishing here all the money-changers of Paris.</p>
<p>It was also called <i>Pont aux Oiseaux</i>, because bird-sellers were
permitted to carry on their business here, on condition of letting loose two
hundred dozen of birds, at the moment when kings and queens passed, in their
way to the cathedral, on the day of their public entry. By this custom, it was
intended to signify that, if the people had been oppressed in the preceding
reign, their rights, privileges, and liberties would be fully re-established
under the new monarch.</p>
<p>On the public entry of Isabeau de Bavière, wife of Charles VI, a Genoese
stretched a rope from the top of the towers of <i>Notre-Dame</i> to one of the
houses on this bridge: he thence descended, dancing on this rope, with a
lighted torch in each hand. Habited as an angel, he placed a crown on the head
of the new queen, and reascending his rope, he appeared again in the air. The
chronicle adds that, as it was already dark, he was seen by all Paris and the
environs.</p>
<p>This bridge was then of wood, and covered with houses also of wood. Two
fires, one of which happened in 1621, and the other in 1639, occasioned it to
be rebuilt of stone in 1647.</p>
<p>The <i>Pont au Change</i> consists of seven arches. Previously to the
demolition of the houses, which, till 1786, stood on each side of this bridge,
the passage was sufficiently wide for three carriages.</p>
<p>Traversing the <i>Ile du Palais</i> from north to south, in order to proceed
from the <i>Pont au Change</i> to the <i>Pont St. Michel</i>, we pass in front
of the</p>
<p class="center">PALAIS DE JUSTICE.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the ninth century, this palace was begun by Eudes. It was
successively enlarged by Robert, son of Hugh Capet, by St. Lewis, and by Philip
the Fair. Under Charles V, who abandoned it to occupy the <i>Hôtel St.
Paul</i>, which he had built, it was nothing more than an assemblage of large
towers, communicating with each other by galleries. In 1383, Charles VI made it
his residence. In 1431, Charles VII relinquished it to the Parliament of Paris.
However, Francis I. took up his abode here for some time.</p>
<p>It was in the great hall of this palace that the kings of France formerly
received ambassadors, and gave public entertainments.</p>
<p>On Whitsunday, 1313, Philip the Fair here knighted his three sons, with all
the ceremonies of ancient chivalry. The king of England, our unfortunate Edward
II, and his abominable queen Isabella, who were invited, crossed the sea on
purpose, and were present at this entertainment, together with a great number
of English barons. It lasted eight days, and is spoken of, by historians, as a
most sumptuous banquet.</p>
<p>This magnificent hall, as well as great part of the palace, being reduced to
ashes in 1618, it was rebuilt, in its present state, under the direction of
that skilful architect, JACQUES DE BROSSES. It is both spacious and majestic,
and is the only hall of the kind in France: the arches and arcades which
support it are of hewn stone.</p>
<p>Another fire, which happened in 1776, consumed all the part extending from
the gallery of prisoners to the <i>Sainte Chapelle</i>, founded by St. Lewis,
and where, before the revolution, were shewn a number of costly relics. The
ravages occasioned by this fire, were repaired in 1787, and the space in front
laid open by the erection of uniform buildings in the form of a crescent. To
two gloomy gothic gates has been substituted an iron railing, of one hundred
and twenty feet in extent, through which is seen a spacious court formed by two
wings of new edifices, and a majestic façade that affords an entrance to the
interior of the palace.</p>
<p>In this court Madame La Motte, who, in 1786, made so conspicuous a figure in
the noted affair of the diamond necklace, was publicly whipped. I was in Paris
at the time, though not present at the execution of the sentence.</p>
<p>In the railing, are three gates, the centre one of which is charged with
garlands and other gilt ornaments. At the two ends are pavilions decorated with
four Doric pillars. Towards the <i>Pont St. Michel</i> is a continuation of the
building ornamented with a bas-relief, at present denominated <i>Le serment
civique</i>.</p>
<p>At the top of a flight of steps, is an avant-corps, with four Doric columns,
a balustrade above the entablature, four statues standing on a level with the
base of the pillars, and behind, a square dome.</p>
<p>These steps lead you to the <i>Mercière</i> gallery, having on the one side,
the <i>Sainte Chapelle</i>, and on the other, the great hall, called the
<i>Salle des Procureurs</i>. In this extensive hall are shops, for the sale of
eatables and pamphlets, which, since the suppression of the Parliament, seem to
have little custom, as well as those of the milliners, &amp;c. in the other
galleries.</p>
<p>In what was formerly called the <i>grande chambre</i>, where the Parliament
of Paris used to sit, the ill-fated Lewis XVI, in 1788, held the famous bed of
justice, in which D'ESPRESMENIL, one of the members of that body, struck the
first blow at royalty; a blow that was revenged by a <i>lettre de cachet</i>,
which exiled him to the <i>Ile de St. Marguerite</i>, famous for being the
place of confinement of the great personage who was always compelled to wear an
<i>iron mask</i>. The courage of this counsellor, who was a noble and deputy of
the <i>noblesse</i>, may be considered as the <i>primum mobile</i> of the
revolution. Under the despotism of the court, he braved all its vengeance; but,
in the sequel, he afforded a singular proof of the instability of the human
mind. After haying stirred up all the parliaments against the royal authority,
he again became the humble servant of the crown.</p>
<p>After the revolution, the <i>Palais de Justice</i> became the seat of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, where the satellites of Robespierre, not content with
sending to the scaffold sixty victims at a time, complained of the
insufficiency of their means for bringing to trial all the enemies of liberty.
Dumas, at one time president of this sanguinary tribunal, proposed to his
colleagues to join to the hall, where the tribunal sat, part of the great hall
of the palace, in order to assemble there five or six hundred victims at a
time; and on its being observed to him that such a sight might in the end
disgust the people; "Well," said he, "there's but one method of accomplishing
our object, without any obstacle, that is to erect a guillotine in the
court-yard of every prison, and cause the prisoners to be executed there during
the night." Had not Robespierre's downfall involved that of all his
blood-thirsty dependents, there seems no doubt that this plan would have been
carried into speedy execution.</p>
<p>Nothing can paint the vicissitude of human events in colours more striking
than the transitions of this critical period. Dumas who made this proposal, and
had partially satisfied his merciless disposition by signing, a few hours
before, the death-warrant of sixty victims, was the very next day brought
before the same tribunal, composed of his accomplices, or rather his creatures,
and by them condemned to die. Thus did experience confirm the general
observation, that the multiplicity and enormity of punishments announces an
approaching revolution. The torrents of blood which tyrants shed, are, in the
end, swelled by their own.</p>
<p>In lieu of a tribunal of blood, the <i>Palais de Justice</i> is now
appropriated to the sittings of the three tribunals, designated by the
following titles: <i>Tribunal de cassation</i>, <i>Tribunal d'appel</i>, and
<i>Tribunal de première instance</i>. The first of these, the <i>Tribunal de
cassation</i>, occupies the audience-chambers of the late parliament; while the
<i>grande chambre</i> is appointed for the meetings of its united Sections. The
decoration of this spacious apartment is entirely changed: it is embellished in
the antique style; and a person in contemplating it might fancy himself at
Athens.</p>
<p>Adjoining to the <i>Palais de Justice</i>, is the famous prison, so dreaded
in the early periods of the revolution, called</p>
<p class="center">LA CONCIERGERIE.</p>
<p>From this fatal abode, neither talent, virtue, nor patriotism could, at one
time, secure those who possessed such enviable qualities. Lavoisier,
Malsherbes, Condorcet, &amp;c. were here successively immured, previously to
being sent to the guillotine. Here too the unfortunate Marie-Antoinette lived
in a comfortless manner, from the 2nd of July, 1793, to the 13th of October
following, the period of her condemnation.</p>
<p>On being reconducted to the prison, at four o'clock in the morning, after
hearing her sentence read, the hapless queen displayed a fortitude worthy of
the daughter of the high-minded Maria Theresa. She requested a few hours'
respite, to compose her mind, and entreated to be left to herself in the room
which she had till then occupied. The moment she was alone, she first cut off
her hair, and then laying aside her widow's weeds, which she had always worn
since the death of the king, put on a white dress, and threw herself on her
bed, where she slept till eleven o'clock the same morning, when she was
awakened, in order to be taken to the scaffold.</p>
<p>Continuing to cross the <i>Ile du Palais</i> in a direction towards the
south, we presently reach the</p>
<p class="center">PONT ST. MICHEL.</p>
<p>This bridge stands in a direct line with the <i>Pont au Change</i>, and is
situated on the south channel of the river. It was formerly of wood: but having
been frequently destroyed, it was rebuilt with stone in 1618, and covered on
both sides with houses. From the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, the back of these buildings
has a most disagreeable and filthy appearance. It is said that they are to be
taken down, as those have been which stood on the other bridges.</p>
<p>In severe winters, when there is much ice in the river, it is curious, on
the breaking up of the frost, to behold families deserting their habitations,
like so many rats, and carrying with them their valuables, from the
apprehension that these crazy tenements might fall into the river. This wise
precaution is suggested by the knowledge of these bridges, when built of wood,
having been often swept away by ice or great inundations.</p>
<p>The <i>Pont St. Michel</i> consists of four arches. Its length is two
hundred and sixty-eight feet, by sixty in breadth, including the houses,
between which is a passage for three carriages.</p>
<p>If, to avoid being entangled in narrow, dirty streets, we return, by the
same route, to the north bank of the Seine, and proceed to the westward, along
the <i>Quai de Gévres</i>, which is partly built on piles, driven into the bed
of the river, we shall come to the</p>
<p class="center">PONT NOTRE-DAME.</p>
<p>A wooden bridge, which previously existed here, having been frequently
carried away by inundations, Lewis XII ordered the construction of the present
one of stone, which was begun in 1499, and completed in 1507. It was built from
the plan of one JOCONDE, a Cordelier, and native of Verona, and is generally
admired for the solidity, as well as beauty of its architecture. It consists of
six arches, and is two hundred and seventy-six feet in length. Formerly it was
bordered by houses, which were taken down in 1786: this has rendered the
quarter more airy, and consequently more salubrious.</p>
<p>It was on this bridge that the Pope's Legate reviewed the ecclesiastical
infantry of the League, on the the 3d of June, 1590. Capuchins, Minimes,
Cordeliers, Jacobins or Dominicans, Feuillans, &amp;c. all with their robe
tucked up, their cowl thrown behind, a helmet on their head, a coat of mail on
their body, a sword by their side, and a musquet on their shoulder, marched
four by four, headed by the reverend bishop of Senlis, bearing a spontoon. But
some of this holy soldiery, forgetting that their pieces were loaded with ball,
wished to salute the Legate, and killed by his side one of his chaplains. His
Eminence finding that it began to grow hot at this review, hastened to give his
benediction, and vanished.</p>
<p /><p /><p /><p class="right"><i>December 18, in continuation</i>.</p>
<p>Traversing once more two-thirds of the <i>Ile du Palais</i> in a direction
from north to south, and then striking off to the east, up the <i>Rue de
Callandre</i>, we reach the</p>
<p class="center">CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE-DAME.</p>
<p>This church, the first ever built in Paris, was begun about the year 375,
under the reign of the emperor Valentinian I. It was then called <i>St.
Etienne</i> or <i>St. Stephen's</i>, and there was as yet no other within the
walls of this city in 1522, when Childebert, son of Clovis, repaired and
enlarged it, adding to it a new basilic, which was dedicated to <i>Notre
Dame</i> or Our Lady.</p>
<p>More anciently, under Tiberius, there had been, on the same spot, an altar
in the open air, dedicated to Jupiter and other pagan gods, part of which is
still in being at the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS, in the <i>Rue des Petits
Augustins</i>.</p>
<p>These two churches existed till about the year 1160, under the reign of
Lewis the Young, when the construction of the present cathedral was begun
partly on their foundations. It was not finished till 1185, during the reign of
Philip Augustus.</p>
<p>This Gothic Church is one of the handsomest and most spacious in France. It
has a majestic and venerable appearance, and is supported by one hundred and
twenty clustered columns. Its length is three hundred and ninety feet by one
hundred and forty-four in breadth, and one hundred and two in height.</p>
<p>We must not expect to find standing here the twenty-six kings, benefactors
of this church, from Childeric I to Philip Augustus, fourteen feet high, who
figured on the same line, above the three doors of the principal façade. They
have all fallen under the blows of the iconoclasts, and are now piled up behind
the church. There lie round-bellied Charlemagne, with his pipe in his mouth,
and Pepin the Short, with his sword in his hand, and a lion, the emblem of
courage, under his feet. The latter, like Tydeus, mentioned in the Iliad,
though small in stature, was stout in heart, as appears from the following
anecdote related of him by the monk of St. Gal.</p>
<p>In former times, as is well known, kings took a delight in setting wild
beasts and ferocious animals to fight against each other. At one of thege
fights, between a lion and a bull, in the abbey of Ferrières, Pepin the Short,
who knew that some noblemen were daily exercising their pleasantry on his small
stature, addressed to them this question: "Which of you feels himself bold
enough to kill or separate those terrible animals?" Seeing that not one of them
stepped forward, and that the proposal alone made them shudder: "Well," added
he, "'tis I then who will perform the feat." He accordingly descended from his
place, drew his sword, killed the lion, at another stroke cut off the head of
the bull, and then looking fiercely at the railers: "Know," said he to them,
"that stature adds nothing to courage, and that I shall find means to bring to
the ground the proud persons who shall dare to despise me, as little David laid
low the great giant Goliah." Hence the attribute given to the statue of king
Pepin, which not long since adorned the façade of <i>Notre-Dame</i>.</p>
<p>The groups of angels, saints, and patriarchs, which, no doubt, owe their
present existence only to their great number, still present to the eye of the
observer that burlesque mixture of the profane and religious, so common in the
symbolical representations of the twelfth century. These figures adorn the
triple row of indented borders of the arches of the three doors.</p>
<p>Two enormous square towers, each two hundred and two feet in height, and
terminated by a platform, decorate each end of the cathedral. The ascent to
them is by a winding staircase of three hundred and eighty-nine steps, and
their communication is by a gallery which has no support but Gothic pillars of
a lightness that excites admiration.</p>
<p>Independently of the six bells, which have disappeared with the little
belfry that contained them, in the two towers were ten, one of which weighed
forty-four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>At the foot of the north tower is the rural calendar or zodiac, which has
been described by M. Le Gentil, member of the Academy of Sciences. The Goths
had borrowed from the Indians this custom of thus representing rustic labours
at the entrance of their temples.</p>
<p>Another Gothic bas-relief, which is seen on the left, in entering by the
great door, undoubtedly represents that condemned soul who, tradition says,
rose from his bier, during divine service, in order to pronounce his own
damnation.</p>
<p>None of the forty-five chapels have preserved the smallest vestige of their
ornaments. Those which escaped the destructive rage of the modern Vandals, have
been transported to the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS. The most remarkable are the
statue of Pierre de Gondi, archbishop of Paris, the mausoleum of the Conte
d'Harcourt, designed by his widow, the modern Artemisia, and executed by
Pigalle, together with the group representing the vow of St. Lewis, by Costou
the elder. Six angels in bronze, which were seen at the further end of the
choir, have also been removed thither.</p>
<p>The stalls present, in square and oval compartments, bas-reliefs very
delicately sculptured, representing subjects taken from the life of the Holy
Virgin and from the New Testament. Of the two episcopal pulpits, which are at
the further end, the one, that of the archbishop, represents the martyrdom of
St. Denis; the other, opposite, the cure of king Childebert, by the
intercession of St. Germain.</p>
<p>Some old tapestry, hung scantily round the choir, makes one regret the
handsome iron railing, so richly wrought, by which it was inclosed, and some
valuable pictures, which now figure in the grand Gallery of the CENTRAL MUSEUM
OF THE ARTS.</p>
<p>The nave, quite as naked as the choir and the sanctuary, had been enriched,
as far as the space would admit, with pictures, twelve feet high, given for a
long time, on every first of May, by the Goldsmiths' company and the fraternity
of St. Anne and St. Marcel.</p>
<p>On the last pillar of the nave, on the right, was the equestrian statue of
Philip of Valois. That king was here represented on horseback, with his vizor
down, sword in hand, and armed cap-à-pié, in the very manner in which he rode
into the cathedral of <i>Notre-Dame</i>, in 1328, after the battle of Cassel.
At the foot of the altar he left his horse, together with his armour, which he
had worn in the battle, as an offering to the Holy Virgin, after having
returned thanks to God and to her, say historians, for the victory he had
obtained through her intercession.</p>
<p>Above the lateral alleys, as well of the choir as of the nave, are large
galleries, separated by little pillars of a single piece, and bordered by iron
balustrades. Here spectators place themselves to see grand ceremonies. From
their balconies were formerly suspended the colours taken from the enemy: these
are now displayed in the <i>Temple of Mars</i> at the HÔTEL DES INVALIDES.</p>
<p>The organ, which appears to have suffered no injury, is reckoned one of the
loudest and most complete in France. It is related that Daquin, an incomparable
organist, who died in 1781, once imitated the nightingale on it so perfectly,
that the beadle was sent on the roof of the church, to endeavour to discover
the musical bird.</p>
<p>Some of the stained glass is beautiful. Two roses, restored to their
original state, the one on the side of the archipiscopal palace in 1726, and
the other above the organ, in 1780, prove by their lustre, that the moderns are
not so inferior to the ancients, in the art of painting on glass, as is
commonly imagined.</p>
<p>Should your curiosity lead you to contemplate the house of Fulbert, the
canon, the supposed uncle to the tender Héloïse, where that celebrated woman
passed her youthful days, you must enter, by the cloister of <i>Notre-Dame</i>,
into the street that leads to the <i>Pont Rouge</i>, since removed. It is the
last house on the right under the arcade, and is easily distinguished by two
medallions in stone, preserved on the façade, though it has been several times
rebuilt during the space of six hundred years. All the authors who have written
on the antiquities of Paris, speak of these medallions as being real portraits
of Abélard and Héloïse. It is presumable that they were so originally; but,
without being a connoisseur, any one may discover that the dresses of these
figures are far more modern than those peculiar to the twelfth century; whence
it may be concluded that the original portraits having been destroyed by time,
or by the alterations which the house has undergone, these busts have been
executed by some more modern sculptor of no great talents.</p>
<p>Leaving the cathedral, by the <i>Rue Notre-Dame</i>, and turning to the
left, on reaching the <i>Marché Palu</i>, we come to the</p>
<p class="center">PETIT PONT.</p>
<p>Like the <i>Pont St. Michel</i>, this bridge is situated on the south
channel of the river, and stands in a direct line with the <i>Pont
Notre-Dame</i>. It originally owed its construction to the following
circumstance.</p>
<p>Four Jews, accused of having killed one of their converted brethren, were
condemned to be publicly whipped through all the streets of the city, on four
successive Sundays. After having suffered the half of their sentence, to redeem
themselves from the other half, they paid 18,000 francs of gold. This sum was
appropriated to the erection of the <i>Petit Pont</i>, the first stone of which
was laid by Charles VI, in 1395.</p>
<p>In 1718, two barges, loaded with hay, caught fire, and being cut loose,
drifted under the arches of this bridge, which, in the space of four hours, was
consumed, together with the houses standing on it. The following year it was
rebuilt, but without houses.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the east, along the quays of the <i>Ile du Palais</i>, you
will find the</p>
<p class="center">PONT AU DOUBLE.</p>
<p>This little bridge, situated behind the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>, of which I shall
speak hereafter, is destined for foot-passengers only, as was the <i>Pont
Rouge</i>. <a name="let33fr1"></a>The latter was the point of communication
between the <i>Cité</i> and the <i>Ile St. Louis</i>; but the frequent
reparations which it required, occasioned it to be removed in 1791, though, by
the Plan of Paris, it still appears to be in existence. However, it is in
contemplation to replace it by another of stone.[<a href="#let33f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>Supposing that you have regained the north bank of the Seine, by means of
the <i>Pont Notre-Dame</i>, you follow the quays, which skirt that shore, till
you reach the</p>
<p class="center">PONT MARIE.</p>
<p>This bridge forms a communication between the <i>Port St. Paul</i> and the
<i>Ile St. Louis</i>. The <i>Pont Marie</i> was named after the engineer who
engaged with Henry IV to build it; but that prince having been assassinated;
the young king, Lewis XIII, and the queen dowager, laid the first stone in
1614: it was finished, and bordered with houses, in 1635. It consists of five
arches. Its length is three hundred feet by sixty-two in breadth. An inundation
having carried away two of the arches, in 1658, they were repaired without the
addition of houses, and in 1789, the others were removed.</p>
<p>Passing through the <i>Rue des Deux Ponts</i>, which lies in a direct line
with the <i>Pont Marie</i>, we arrive at the</p>
<p class="center">PONT DE LA TOURNELLE.</p>
<p>This bridge takes its name from the <i>Château de la Tournelle</i>,
contiguous to the <i>Porte St. Bernard</i>, where the galley-slaves used
formerly to be lodged, till they were sent off to the different public works.
It consists of six arches of solid construction, and is bordered on each side
by a foot-pavement.</p>
<p>You are now acquainted with all the bridges in Paris; but should you prefer
crossing the Seine in a boat, there are several ferries between the bridges,
and at other convenient places. Here, you may always meet with a waterman, who,
for the sum of one <i>sou</i>, will carry you over, whether master or lackey.
Like the old ferryman Charon, he makes no distinction of persons.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let33f1">Footnote 1</a>: Workmen are, at this moment,
employed in the construction of three new bridges. The first, already
mentioned, will form a communication between the <i>ci-devant Collège des
Quatre Nations</i> and the <i>Louvre</i>; the second, between the <i>Ile du
Palais</i> and the <i>Ile St. Louis</i>; and the third, between the <i>Jardin
des Plantes</i> and the Arsenal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let33fr1">Return to

<h2><a name="let34">LETTER XXXVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 20, 1801.</i></p>
<p>What a charming abode is Paris, for a man who can afford to live at the rate
of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds a year! Pleasures wait not for him to
go in quest of them; they come to him of their own accord; they spring up, in a
manner, under his very feet, and form around him an officious retinue. Every
moment of the day can present a new gratification to him who knows how to enjoy
it; and, with prudent management, the longest life even would not easily
exhaust so ample a stock.</p>
<p>Paris has long been termed an epitome of the world. But, perhaps, never
could this denomination be applied to it with so much propriety as at the
present moment. The chances of war have not only rendered it the centre of the
fine arts, the museum of the most celebrated masterpieces in existence, the
emporium where the luxury of Europe comes to procure its superfluities; but the
taste for pleasure has also found means to assemble here all the enjoyments
which Nature seemed to have exclusively appropriated to other climates.</p>
<p>Every country has its charms and advantages. Paris alone appears to combine
them all. Every region, every corner of the globe seems to vie in hastening to
forward hither the tribute of its productions. Are you an epicure? No delicacy
of the table but may be eaten in Paris.&mdash;Are you a toper? No delicious
wine but may be drunk, in Paris.&mdash;Are you fond of frequenting places of
public entertainment? No sort of spectacle but may be seen in Paris.&mdash;Are
you desirous of improving your mind? No kind of instruction but may be acquired
in Paris.&mdash;Are you an admirer of the fair sex? No description of female
beauty but may be obtained in Paris.&mdash;Are you partial to the society of
men of extraordinary talents? No great genius but comes to display his
knowledge in Paris.&mdash;Are you inclined to discuss military topics? No hero
but brings his laurels to Paris.&mdash;In a word, every person, favoured by
Nature or Fortune, flies to enjoy the gifts of either in Paris. Even every
place celebrated in the annals of voluptuousness, is, as it were, reproduced in
Paris, which, in some shape or another, presents its name or image.</p>
<p>Without going out of this capital, you may, in the season when Nature puts
on her verdant livery, visit <i>Idalium</i>, present your incense to the
Graces, and adore, in her temple, the queen of love; while at <i>Tivoli</i>,
you may, perhaps, find as many beauties and charms as were formerly admired at
the enchanting spot on the banks of the Anio, which, under its ancient name of
<i>Tibur</i>, was so extolled by the Latin poets; and close to the Boulevard,
at <i>Frascati</i>, you may, in that gay season, eat ices as good as those with
which Cardinal de Bernis used to regale his visiters, at his charming villa in
the <i>Campagna di Roma</i>. Who therefore need travel farther than Paris to
enjoy every gratification?</p>
<p>If then, towards the close of a war, the most frightful and destructive that
ever was waged, the useful and agreeable seem to have proceeded here hand in
hand in improvement, what may not be expected in the tranquillity of a few
years' peace? Who knows but the emperor Julian's "<i>dear Lutetia</i>" may one
day vie in splendour with Thebes and its hundred gates, or ancient Rome
covering its seven mountains?</p>
<p>However, if <i>Tivoli</i> and <i>Frascati</i> throw open their delightful
recesses to the votaries of pleasure only in spring and summer, even now,
during the fogs of December, you may repair to</p>
<p class="center">PAPHOS.</p>
<p>It might almost be said that you enter this place of amusement gratis, for,
though a slight tribute of seventy-five <i>centimes</i> (<i>circa</i>
seven-pence halfpenny sterling) is required for the admission of every person,
yet you may take refreshment to the amount of that sum, without again putting
your hand into your pocket; because the counter mark, given at the door, is
received at the bar as ready-money.</p>
<p>This speculation, the first of the kind in France, and one of the most
specious, is, by all accounts, also one of the most productive. It would be too
rigorous, no doubt, to compare the frequenters of the modern PAPHOS to the
inhabitants of the ancient. Here, indeed, you must neither look for
<i>élégantes</i>, nor <i>muscadins</i>; but you may view belles, less gifted by
Fortune, indulging in innocent recreation; and for a while dispelling their
cares, by dancing to the exhilarating music of an orchestra not ill composed.
Here, the grisette banishes the <i>ennui</i> of six days' application to the
labours of her industry, by footing it away on Sunday. Hither, in short, the
less refined sons and daughters of mirth repair to see and be seen, and to
partake of the general diversion.</p>
<p>PAPHOS is situated on that part of the Boulevard, called the <i>Boulevard du
Temple</i>, whither I was led the other evening by that sort of curiosity,
which can be satisfied only when the objects that afford it aliment are
exhausted. I had just come out of another place of public amusement, at no
great distance, called</p>
<p class="center">LA PHANTASMAGORIE.</p>
<p>This is an exhibition in the <i>Cour des Capucines</i>, adjoining to the
Boulevard, where ROBERTSON, a skilful professor of physics, amuses or terrifies
his audience by the appearance of spectres, phantoms, &amp;c. In the piece
which I saw, called <i>Le Tombeau de Robespierre</i>, he carries illusion to an
extraordinary degree of refinement. His cabinet of physics is rich, and his
effects of optics are managed in the true style of French gallantry. His
experiments of galvanism excite admiration. He repeats the difficult ones of M.
VOLTA, and clearly demonstrates the electrical phenomena presented by the
metallic pile. A hundred disks of silver and a hundred pieces of zinc are
sufficient for him to produce attractions, sparks, the divergency of the
electrometer, and electric hail. He charges a hundred Leyden bottles by the
simple contact of the metallic pile. ROBERTSON, I understand, is the first who
has made these experiments in Paris, and has succeeded in discharging VOLTA's
pistol by the galvanic spark.</p>
<p>FITZJAMES, a famous ventriloquist, entertains and astonishes the company by
a display of his powers, which are truly surprising.</p>
<p>You may, perhaps, be desirous to procure your family circle the satisfaction
of enjoying the <i>Phantasmagoria</i>, though not on the grand scale on which
it is exhibited by ROBERTSON. By the communication of a friend, I am happy in
being enabled to make you master of the secret, as nothing can be more useful
in the education of children than to banish from their mind the deceitful
illusion of ghosts and hobgoblins, which they are so apt to imbibe from their
nurses. But to the point&mdash;"You have," says my author, "only to call in the
first itinerant foreigner, who perambulates the streets with a
<i>galantee-show</i> (as it is commonly termed in London), and by imparting to
him your wish, if he is not deficient in intelligence and skill, he will soon
be able to give you a rehearsal of the apparition of phantoms: for, by
approaching or withdrawing the stand of his show, and finding the focus of his
glasses, you will see the objects diminish or enlarge either on the white wall,
or the sheet that is extended.</p>
<p>"The illusion which leads us to imagine that an object which increases in
all its parts, is advancing towards us, is the basis of the
<i>Phantasmagoria</i>, and, in order to produce it with the
<i>galantee-show</i>, you have only to withdraw slowly the lantern from the
place on which the image is represented, by approaching the outer lens to that
on which the object is traced: this is easily done, that glass being fixed in a
moveable tube like that of an opera-glass. As for approaching the lantern
gradually, it may be effected with the same facility, by placing it on a little
table with castors, and, by means of a very simple mechanism, it is evident
that both these movements may be executed together in suitable progression.</p>
<p>"The deception recurred to by phantasmagorists is further increased by the
mystery that conceals, from the eyes of the public, their operations and
optical instruments: but it is easy for the showman to snatch from them this
superiority, and to strengthen the illusion for the children whom you choose to
amuse with this sight. For that purpose, he has only to change the arrangement
of the sheet, by requiring it to be suspended from the ceiling, between him and
the spectators, much in the same manner as the curtain of a playhouse, which
separates the stage from the public. The transparency of the cloth shews
through it the coloured rays, and, provided it be not of too thick and too
close a texture, the image presents itself as clear on the one side as on the
other.</p>
<p>"If to these easy means you could unite those employed by ROBERTSON, such as
the black hangings, which absorb the coloured rays, the little musical
preparations, and others, you might transform all the <i>galantee-shows</i>
into as many <i>phantasmagorias</i>, in spite of the priority of invention,
which belongs, conscientiously, to Father KIRCHER, a German Jesuit, who first
found means to apply his knowledge respecting light to the construction of the
magic lantern.</p>
<p>"The coloured figures, exhibited by the phatasmagorists, have no relation to
these effects of light: they are effigies covered with gold-beater's skin, or
any other transparent substance, in which is placed a dark lantern. The light
of this lantern is extinguished or concealed by pulling a string, or touching a
spring, at the moment when any one wishes to seize on the figure, which, by
this contrivance, seems to disappear.</p>
<p>"The proprietors of the grand exhibitions of <i>phantasmagoria</i> join to
these simple means a combination of different effects, which they partly derive
from the phenomena, presented by the <i>camera obscura</i>. Some faint idea of
that part of physics, called optics, which NEWTON illuminated, by his genius
and experience, are sufficient for conceiving the manner in which these
appearances are produced, though they require instruments and particular care
to give them proper effect."</p>
<p>Such is the elucidation given of the <i>phantasmagoria</i> by an intelligent
observer, whose friend favoured me with this communication.</p>
<h2><a name="let37">LETTER XXXVII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 21, 1801.</i></p>
<p>If Paris affords a thousand enjoyments to the man of fortune, it may truly
be said that, without money, Paris is the most melancholy abode in the world.
Privations are then the more painful, because desires and even wants are
rendered more poignant by the ostentatious display of every object which might
satisfy them. What more cruel for an unfortunate fellow, with an empty purse,
than to pass by the kitchen of a <i>restaurateur</i>, when, pinched by hunger,
he has not the means of procuring himself a dinner? His olfactory nerves being
still more readily affected when his stomach is empty, far from affording him a
pleasing sensation, then serve only to sharpen the torment which he suffers. It
is worse than the punishment of Tantalus, who, dying with thirst, could not
drink, though up to his chin in water.</p>
<p>Really, my dear friend, I would advise every rich epicure to fix his
residence in this city. Without being plagued by the details of housekeeping,
or even at the trouble of looking at a bill of fare, he might feast his eye,
and his appetite too, on the inviting plumpness of a turkey, stuffed with
truffles. A boar's head set before him, with a Seville orange between its
tusks, might make him fancy that he was discussing the greatest interests of
mankind at the table of an Austrian Prime Minister, or British Secretary of
State; while <i>pâtés</i> of <i>Chartres</i> or of <i>Périgord</i> hold out to
his discriminating palate all the refinements of French seasoning. These, and
an endless variety of other dainties, no less tempting, might he contemplate
here, in walking past a <i>magazin de comestibles</i> or
provision-warehouse.</p>
<p>Among the changes introduced here, within these few years, I had heard much
of the improvements in the culinary art, or rather in the manner of serving up
its productions; but, on my first arrival in Paris, I was so constantly engaged
in a succession of dinner-parties, that some time elapsed before I could avail
myself of an opportunity of dining at the house of any of the fashionable</p>
<p class="center">RESTAURATEURS.</p>
<p>This is a title of no very ancient date in Paris. <i>Traiteurs</i> have long
existed here: independently of furnishing repasts at home, these
<i>traiteurs</i>, like Birch in Cornhill, or any other famous London cook, sent
out dinners and suppers. But, in 1765, one BOULANGER conceived the idea of
<i>restoring</i> the exhausted animal functions of the debilitated Parisians by
rich soups of various denominations. Not being a <i>traiteur</i>, it appears
that he was not authorized to serve ragouts; he therefore, in addition to his
<i>restorative</i> soups, set before his customers new-laid eggs and boiled
fowl with strong gravy sauce: those articles were served up without a cloth, on
little marble tables. Over his door he placed the following inscription,
borrowed from Scripture: "<i>Venite ad me omnes qui stomacho laboratis, et ego
restaurabo vos.</i>"</p>
<p>Such was the origin of the word and profession of <i>restaurateur</i>.</p>
<p>Other cooks, in imitation of BOULANGER, set up as <i>restorers</i>, on a
similar plan, in all the places of public entertainment where such
establishments were admissible. Novelty, fashion, and, above all, dearness,
brought them into vogue. Many a person who would have been ashamed to be seen
going into a <i>traiteur's</i>, made no hesitation of entering a
<i>restaurateur's</i>, where he paid nearly double the price for a dinner of
the same description. However, as, in all trades, it is the great number of
customers that enrich the trader, rather than the select few, the
<i>restaurateurs</i>, in order to make their business answer, were soon under
the necessity of constituting themselves <i>traiteurs</i>; so that, in lieu of
one title, they now possess two; and this is the grand result of the primitive
establishment.</p>
<p>At the head of the most noted <i>restaurateurs</i> in Paris, previously to
the revolution, was LA BARRIÈRE in the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i>; but,
though his larder was always provided with choice food, his cellar furnished
with good wines, his bill of fare long, and the number of his customers
considerable, yet his profits, he said, were not sufficiently great to allow
him to cover his tables with linen. This omission was supplied by green wax
cloth; a piece of economy which, he declared, produced him a saving of near
10,000 livres (<i>circa</i> 400£ sterling) per annum in the single article of
washing. Hence you may form an idea of the extent of such an undertaking. I
have often dined at LA BARRIÈRE'S was always well served, at a moderate charge,
and with remarkable expedition. Much about that time, BEAUVILLIERS, who had
opened, within the same precincts, a similar establishment, but on a more
refined plan, proved a most formidable rival to LA BARRIÈRE, and at length
eclipsed him.</p>
<p>After a lapse of almost eleven years, I again find this identical
BEAUVILLIERS still in the full enjoyment of the greatest celebrity. ROBERT and
NAUDET in the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, and VÉRY on the <i>Terrace des
Feuillant</i> dispute with him the palm in the art of Apicius. All these, it is
true, furnish excellent repasts, and their wines are not inferior to their
cooking: but, after more than one impartial trial, I think I am justified in
giving the preference to BEAUVILLIERS. Let us then take a view of his
arrangements: this, with a few variations in price or quality, will serve as a
general picture of the <i>ars coquinaria</i> in Paris.</p>
<p>On the first floor of a large hotel, formerly occupied, perhaps, by a
farmer-general, you enter a suite of apartments, decorated with arabesques, and
mirrors of large dimensions, in a style no less elegant than splendid, where
tables are completely arranged for large or small parties. In winter, these
rooms are warmed by ornamental stoves, and lighted by <i>quinquets</i>, a
species of Argand's lamps. They are capable of accommodating from two hundred
and fifty to three hundred persons, and, at this time of the year, the average
number that dine here daily is about two hundred; in summer, it is considerably
decreased by the attractions of the country, and the parties of pleasure made,
in consequence, to the environs of the capital.</p>
<p>On the left hand, as you pass into the first room, rises a sort of throne,
not unlike the <i>estrado</i> in the grand audience-chamber of a Spanish
viceroy. This throne is encircled by a barrier to keep intruders at a
respectful distance. Here sits a lady, who, from her majestic gravity and
dignified bulk, you might very naturally suppose to be an empress, revolving in
her comprehensive mind the affairs of her vast dominions. This respectable
personage is Madame BEAUVILLIERS, whose most interesting concern is to collect
from the gentlemen in waiting the cash which they receive at the different
tables. In this important branch, she has the assistance of a lady, somewhat
younger than herself, who, seated by her side, in stately silence, has every
appearance of a maid of honour. A person in waiting near the throne, from his
vacant look and obsequious carriage, might, at first sight, be taken for a
chamberlain; whereas his real office, by no means an unimportant one, is to
distribute into deserts the fruit and other <i>et ceteras</i>, piled up within
his reach in tempting profusion.</p>
<p>We will take our seats in this corner, whence, without laying down our knife
and fork, we can enjoy a full view of the company as they enter. We are rather
early: by the clock, I perceive that it is no more than five: at six, however,
there will scarcely be a vacant seat at any of the tables. "<i>Garçon, la
carte</i>!"&mdash;"<i>La voilà devant vous, Monsieur.</i>"</p>
<p>Good heaven! the bill of fare is a printed sheet of double <i>folio</i>, of
the size of an English newspaper. It will require half an hour at least to con
over this important catalogue. Let us see; Soups, thirteen
sorts.&mdash;<i>Hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i>, twenty-two species.&mdash;Beef,
dressed in eleven different ways.&mdash;Pastry, containing fish, flesh and
fowl, in eleven shapes. Poultry and game, under thirty-two various
forms.&mdash;Veal, amplified into twenty-two distinct articles.&mdash;Mutton,
confined to seventeen only.&mdash;Fish, twenty-three varieties.&mdash;Roast
meat, game, and poultry, of fifteen kinds.&mdash;Entremets, or side-dishes, to
the number of forty-one articles.&mdash;Desert, thirty-nine.&mdash;Wines,
including those of the liqueur kind, of fifty-two denominations, besides ale
and porter.&mdash;Liqueurs, twelve species, together with coffee and ices.</p>
<p>Fudge! fudge! you cry&mdash;Pardon me, my good friend, 'tis no fudge. Take
the tremendous bill of fare into your own hand. <i>Vide et lege</i>. As we are
in no particular hurry, travel article by article through the whole
enumeration. This will afford you the most complete notion of the expense of
dining at a fashionable <i>restaurateur's</i> in Paris.</p>

<p>One advantage, well deserving of notice, of this bill of fare with the price
annexed to each article, is, that, when you have made up your mind as to what
you wish to have for dinner, you have it in your power, before you give the
order, to ascertain the expense. But, though you see the price of each dish,
you see not the dish itself; and when it comes on the table, you may, perhaps,
be astonished to find that a pompous, big-sounding name sometimes produces only
a scrap of scarcely three mouthfuls. It is the mountain in labour delivered of
a mouse.</p>
<p>However, if you are not a man of extraordinary appetite, you may, for the
sum of nine or ten francs, appease your hunger, drink your bottle of Champagne
or Burgundy, and, besides, assist digestion by a dish of coffee and a glass of
liqueur. Should you like to partake of two different sorts of wine, you may
order them, and drink at pleasure of both; if you do not reduce the contents
below the moiety, you pay only for the half bottle. A necessary piece of advice
to you as a stranger, is, that, while you are dispatching your first dish, you
should take care to order your second, and so on in progression to the end of
the chapter: otherwise, for want of this precaution, when the company is very
numerous, you may, probably, have to wait some little time between the acts,
before you are served.</p>
<p>This is no trifling consideration, if you purpose, after dinner, to visit
one of the principal theatres: for, if a new or favourite piece be announced,
the house is full, long before the raising of the curtain; and you not only
find no room at the theatre to which you first repair; but, in all probability,
this disappointment will follow you to every other for that evening.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ten or fifteen minutes are sufficient for the most dainty or
troublesome dish to undergo its final preparation, and in that time you will
have it smoking on the table. Those which admit of being completely prepared
beforehand, are in a constant state of readiness, and require only to be set
over the fire to be warmed. Each cook has a distinct branch to attend to in the
kitchen, and the call of a particular waiter to answer, as each waiter has a
distinct number of tables, and the orders of particular guests to obey in the
dining-rooms. In spite of the confused noise arising from the gabble of so many
tongues, there being probably eighty or a hundred persons calling for different
articles, many of whom are hasty and impatient, such is the habitual good order
observed, that seldom does any mistake occur; the louder the vociferations of
the hungry guests, the greater the diligence of the alert waiters. Should any
article, when served, happen not to suit your taste, it is taken back and
changed without the slightest murmur.</p>
<p>The difference between the establishments of the fashionable
<i>restaurateurs</i> before the revolution, and those in vogue at the present
day, is, that their profession presenting many candidates for public favour,
they are under the continual necessity of employing every resource of art to
attract customers, and secure a continuance of them. The commodiousness and
elegance of their rooms, the savouriness of their cooking, the quality of their
wines, the promptitude of their attendants, all are minutely criticized; and,
if they study their own interest, they must neglect nothing to flatter the eyes
and palate. In fact, how do they know that some of their epicurean guests may
not have been of their own fraternity, and once figured in a great French
family as <i>chef de cuisine</i>?</p>
<p>Of course, with all this increase of luxury, you must expect an increase of
expense: but if you do not now dine here at so reasonable a rate as formerly,
at least you are sumptuously served for your money. If you wish to dine
frugally, there are numbers of <i>restaurateurs</i>, where you may be decently
served with <i>potage</i>, <i>bouilli</i>, an <i>entrée</i>, an
<i>entremet</i>, bread and desert, for the moderate sum of from twenty-six to
thirty <i>sous</i>. The addresses of these cheap eating-houses, if they are not
put into your hand in the street, will present themselves to your eye, at the
corner of almost every wall in Paris. Indeed, all things considered, I am of
opinion that the difference in the expense of a dinner at a
<i>restaurateur's</i> at present, and what it was ten or eleven years ago, is
not more than in the due proportion of the increased price of provisions,
house-rent, and taxes.</p>
<p>The difference the most worthy of remark in these rendezvous of good cheer,
unquestionably consists in the company who frequent them. In former times, the
dining-rooms of the fashionable <i>restaurateurs</i> were chiefly resorted to
by young men of good character and connexions, just entering into life,
superannuated officers and batchelors in easy circumstances, foreigners on
their travels, &amp;c. At this day, these are, in a great measure, succeeded by
stock-jobbers, contractors, fortunate speculators, and professed gamblers. In
defiance of the old proverb, "<i>le ventre est le plus grand de tous nos
ennemis,</i>" guttling and guzzling is the rage of these upstarts. It is by no
means uncommon to see many of them begin their dinner by swallowing six or
seven dozen of oysters and a bottle of white wine, by way of laying a
foundation for a <i>potage en tortue</i> and eight or ten other rich dishes.
Such are the modern parvenus, whose craving appetites, in eating and drinking,
as in every thing else, are not easily satiated.</p>
<p>It would be almost superfluous to mention, that where rich rogues abound,
luxurious courtesans are at no great distance, were it not for the sake of
remarking that the former often regale the latter at the <i>restaurateurs</i>,
especially at those houses which afford the convenience of snug, little rooms,
called <i>cabinets particuliers</i>. Here, two persons, who have any secret
affairs to settle, enjoy all possible privacy; for even the waiter never has
the imprudence to enter without being called. In these asylums, Love arranges
under his laws many individuals not suspected of sacrificing at the shrine of
that wonder-working deity. Prudes, whose virtue is the universal boast, and
whose austerity drives thousands of beaux to despair, sometimes make themselves
amends for the reserve which they are obliged to affect in public, by indulging
in a private <i>tête-à-tête</i> in these mysterious recesses. In them too,
young lovers frequently interchange the first declarations of eternal
affection; to them many a husband owes the happiness of paternity; and without
them the gay wife might, perhaps, be at a loss to deceive her jealous Argus,
and find an opportunity of lending an attentive ear to the rapturous addresses
of her aspiring gallant.</p>
<p>What establishment then can be more convenient than that of a
<i>restaurateur</i>? But you would be mistaken, were you to look for
<i>cabinets particuliers</i> at every house of this denomination, Here, at
BEAUVILLIERS', for instance, you will find no such accommodation, though if you
dislike dining in public, you may have a private room proportioned to the
number of a respectable party: or, should you be sitting at home, and just
before the hour of dinner, two or three friends call in unexpectedly, if you
wish to enjoy their company in a quiet, sociable manner, you have only to
dispatch your <i>valet de place</i> to BEAUVILLIERS' or to the nearest
<i>restaurateur</i> of repute for the bill of fare, and at the same time desire
him to bring table-linen, knives, silver forks, spoons, and all other necessary
appurtenances. While he is laying the cloth, you fix on your dinner, and, in
little more than a quarter of an hour, you have one or two elegant courses,
dressed in a capital style, set out on the table. As for wine, if you find it
cheaper, you can procure that article from some respectable wine-merchant in
the neighbourhood. In order to save trouble, many single persons, and even
small families now scarcely ever cook at home; but either dine at a
<i>restaurateur's</i>, or have their dinners constantly furnished from one of
these sources of culinary perfection.</p>
<p>But, while I am relating to you the advantages of these establishments, time
flies apace: 'tis six o'clock.&mdash;If you are not disposed to drink more
wine, let us have some coffee and our bill. When you want to pay, you say:
"<i>Garçon, la carte payante!</i>" The waiter instantly flies to a person,
appointed for that purpose, to whom he dictates your reckoning. On consulting
your stomach, should you doubt what you have consumed, you have only to call in
the aid of your memory, and you will be perfectly satisfied that you have not
been charged with a single article too much or too little.</p>
<p>Remark that portly man, so respectful in his demeanour. It is BEAUVILLIERS,
the master of the house: this is his most busy hour, and he will now make a
tour to inquire at the different tables, if his guests are all served according
to their wishes. He will then, like an able general, take a central station,
whence he can command a view of all his dispositions. The person, apparently
next in consequence to himself, and who seems to have his mind absorbed in
other objects, is the butler: his thoughts are, with the wine under his care,
in the cellar.</p>
<p>Observe the cleanly attention of the waiters, neatly habited in close-bodied
vests, with white aprons before them: watch the quickness of their motions, and
you will be convinced that no scouts of a camp could be more <i>on the
alert</i>. An establishment, so extremely well conducted, excites admiration.
Every spring of the machine duly performs its office; and the regularity of the
whole might serve as a model for the administration of an extensive State.
Repair then, ye modern Machiavels, to N&deg; 1243, <i>Rue de la Loi</i>; and,
while you are gratifying your palate, imbibe instruction from BEAUVILLIERS.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 23, 1801.</i></p>
<p>An establishment at once deserving of the attention of men of feeling,
particularly of those who, in cultivating literature, apply themselves to the
science of metaphysics and grammar; an establishment extremely interesting to
every one, the great difficulties of which mankind had, repeatedly, in the
course of ages, endeavoured to encounter, and which had driven to despair all
those who had ventured to engage in the undertaking; an establishment, in a
word, which produces the happiest effects, and in a most wonderful manner, is
the</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL INSTITUTION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB.</p>
<p>To the most religious of philanthropists is France indebted for this sublime
discovery, and the Abbé SICARD, a pupil of the inventor; the Abbé de l'Epée,
has carried it to such a degree of perfection, that it scarcely appears
possible to make any further progress in so useful an undertaking. And, in
fact, what can be wanting to a species of instruction the object of which is to
establish between the deaf and dumb, and the man who hears and speaks, a
communication like that established between all men by the knowledge and
practice of the same idiom; when the deaf and dumb man, by the help of the
education given him, succeeds in decomposing into phrases the longest period;
into simple propositions, the most complex phrase; into words, each
proposition; into simple words, words the most complex: and when he
distinguishes perfectly words derived from primitives; figurative words from
proper ones; and when, after having thus decomposed the longest discourse, he
recomposes it; when, in short, the deaf and dumb man expresses all his ideas,
all his thoughts, and all his affections; when he answers, like men the
best-informed, all questions put to him, respecting what he knows through the
nature of his intelligence, and respecting what he has learned, either from
himself or from him who has enlightened his understanding? What wish remains to
be formed, when the deaf and dumb man is enabled to learn by himself a foreign
language, when he translates it, and writes it, as well as those of whom it is
the mother-tongue?</p>
<p>Such is the phenomenon which the Institution of the deaf and dumb presents
to the astonishment of Europe, under the direction, or rather under the
regeneration of the successor of the celebrated Abbé de l'Epée. His pupils
realize every thing that I have just mentioned. They write English and Italian
as well as they do French. Nothing equals the justness and precision of their
definitions.</p>
<p>Nor let it be imagined that they resemble birds repeating the tunes they
have learned. Never have they been taught the answer to a question. Their
answers are always the effect of their good logic, and of the ideas of objects
and of qualities of beings, acquired by a mind which the Institutor has formed
from the great art of observation.</p>
<p>This institution was far short of its present state of perfection at the
death of the celebrated inventor, which happened on the 23d of December 1789.
During the long career of their first father, the deaf and dumb had been able
to find means only to write, under the dictation of signs, words whose import
was scarcely known to them. When endeavours were made to make them emerge from
the confined sphere of the first wants, not one of them knew how to express in
writing any thing but ideas of sense and wants of the first necessity. The
nature of the verb, the relations of tenses, that of other words comprehended
in the phrase, and which form the syntax of languages, were utterly unknown to
them. And, indeed, how could they answer the most trifling question? Every
thing in the construction of a period was to them an enigma.</p>
<p>It was not long before the successor of the inventor discovered the defect
of this instruction, which was purely mechanical and acquired by rote. He
thought he perceived this defect in the <i>concrete</i> verb, in which the deaf
and dumb, seeing only a single word, were unable to distinguish two ideas which
are comprehended in it, that of affirmation and that of quality. He thought he
perceived also that defect in the expression of the qualities, always
presented, in all languages, out of the subjects, and never in the noun which
they modify; and, by the help of a process no less simple than ingenious and
profound, he has made the deaf and dumb comprehend the most arduous difficulty,
the nature of abstraction; he has initiated them in the art of generalizing
ideas by presenting to them the adjective in the noun, as the quality is in the
object, and the quality subsisting alone and out of the object, having no
support but in the mind, for him who considers it, and but in the abstract noun
for him who reads the expression of it. He has, in like manner, separated the
verb from the quality in concrete verbs, and communicated to the deaf and dumb
the knowledge of the true verb, which he has pointed out to them in the
termination of all the French verbs, by reattaching to the subject, by a line
agreed on, its verbal quality. This line he has translated by the verb <i>to
be</i>, the only verb recognized by philosophic grammarians.</p>
<p>These are the two foundations of this very extraordinary source of
instruction, and on which all the rest depend. The pronouns are learned by
nouns; the tenses of conjugation, by the three absolute tenses of conjugation
of all languages; and these, by this line, so happily imagined, which is a sign
of the present when it connects the verbal quality and the subject, a sign of
the past when it is intersected, a sign of the future when it is only
begun.</p>
<p>All the conjugations are reduced to a single one, as are all the verbs. The
adverbs considered as adjectives, when they express the manner, and as
substitutes for a preposition and its government, when they express time or
place, &amp;c. The preposition represented as a mean of transmitting the
influence of the word which precedes it to that which follows it; the articles
serving, as in the English language, to determine the extent of a common noun.
Such is a summary of the grammatical system of the Institutor of the deaf and
dumb.</p>
<p>It is the metaphysical part, above all, which, in this institution, is
carried to such a degree of simplicity and clearness, that it is within reach
of understandings the most limited. And, indeed, one ought not to be astonished
at the rapid progress of the deaf and dumb in the art of expressing their ideas
and of communicating in writing with every speaker, as persons absent
communicate with each other by similar means. In the space of eighteen months,
a pupil begins to give an account in writing of the actions of which he is
rendered a witness, and, in the space of five years, his education is
complete.</p>
<p>The objects in which the deaf and dumb are instructed, are Grammar, the
notions of Metaphysics and Logic, which the former renders necessary, Religion,
the Use of the Globes, Geography, Arithmetic, general notions of History,
ancient and modern, of Natural History, of Arts and Trades, &amp;c.</p>
<p>These unfortunates, restored by communication to society, from which Nature
seemed to have intended to exclude them, are usefully employed. One of their
principal occupations is a knowledge of a mechanical art. Masters in the most
ordinary arts are established in the house of the deaf and dumb, and every one
there finds employment in the art which best suits his inclination, his
strength, and his natural disposition. In this school, which is established at
the extremity of the <i>Faubourg St. Jacques</i>, is a printing-office, where
some are employed as compositors; others, as pressmen. In a preparatory
drawing-school they are taught the rudiments of painting, engraving, and
Mosaic, for the last of which there are two workshops. There is also a person
to teach engraving on fine grained stones, as well as a joiner, a tailor, and a
shoemaker. The garden, which is large, is cultivated by the deaf and dumb.
Almost every thing that is used by them is made by themselves. They make their
own bedsteads, chairs, tables, benches, and clothes. The deaf and dumb females
too make their shirts, and the rest of their linen.</p>
<p>Thus their time is so taken up that, with the exception of three hours
devoted to moral instruction, all the rest is employed in manual labour.</p>
<p>Such is this establishment, where the heart is agreeably affected at the
admirable spectacle which presents at once every thing that does the most
honour to human intelligence, in the efforts which it has been necessary to
make in order to overcome the obstacles opposed to its development by the
privation of the sense the most useful, and that of the faculty the most
essential to the communication of men with one another, and the sight of the
physical power employed in seeking, in arts and trades, resources which render
men independent.</p>
<p>But to what degree are these unfortunates deaf, and why are they dumb?</p>
<p>It is well known that they are dumb because they are deaf, and they are more
or less deaf, when they are so only by accident, in proportion as the auditory
nerve is more or less braced, or more or less relaxed. In various experiments
made on sound, some have heard sharp sounds, and not grave ones; others, on the
contrary, have heard grave sounds, and not sharp ones.</p>
<p>All would learn, were it deemed expedient to teach them, the mechanism of
speech. But, besides that the sounds which they would utter, would never be
heard by themselves, and they would never be conscious of having uttered them,
those, sounds would be to those who might listen to them infinitely
disagreeable. Never could they be of use, to them in conversing with us, and
they would serve only to counteract their instruction.</p>
<p>Woe be to the deaf and dumb whom it should be proposed to instruct by
teaching them to speak! How, in fact, can, the development of the understanding
be assisted by teaching them a mechanism which has no object or destination,
when the thought already formed in the mind, by the help of signs which fix the
ideas, restores not the mechanism of speech?</p>
<p>Of this the Institutor has been fully sensible, and, although in his public
lessons, he explains all the efforts of the vocal instrument or organ of the
voice, and proves that he could, as well as any other man, teach the deaf and
dumb to make use of it, all his labour is confined to exercising the instrument
of thought, persuaded that every thing will be obtained, when the deaf and dumb
shall have learned to arrange their ideas, and to think.</p>
<p>It is then only that the Institutor gives lessons of analysis. But, how
brilliant are they! You think yourself transported into a class of logic. The
deaf and dumb man has ceased to be so. A contest begins between him and his
master. All the spectators are astonished; every one wishes to retain what is
written on both sides. It is a lesson given to all present.</p>
<p>Every one is invited to interrogate the deaf and dumb man, and he answers to
any person whatsoever, with a pen or pencil in his hand, and in the same manner
puts a question. He is asked, "What is Time?"&mdash;"Time," says the dumb
pupil, "is a portion of duration, the nature of which is to be successive, to
have commenced, and consequently to have passed, and to be no more; to be
present, and to be so through necessity. Time," adds he, "is the fleeting or
the future." As if in the eyes of the dumb there was nothing real in Time but
the future.&mdash;"What is eternity?" says another to him&mdash;"It is a day
without yesterday, or to-morrow," replies the pupil.&mdash;"What is a
sense?"&mdash;"It is a vehicle for ideas."&mdash;"What is duration?"&mdash;"It
is a line which has no end, or a circle."&mdash;"What is happiness?"&mdash;"It
is a pleasure which never ceases."&mdash;"What is God?"&mdash;"The author of
nature, the sun of eternity."&mdash;"What is friendship?"&mdash;"The affection
of the mind."&mdash;"What is gratitude?"&mdash;"The memory of the heart."</p>
<p>There are a thousand answers of this description, daily collected at the
lessons of the deaf and dumb by those who attend them, and which attest the
superiority of this kind of instruction over the common methods. Thus, this
institution is not only, in regard to beneficence and humanity, deserving of
the admiration of men of feeling, it merits also the observation of men of
superior understanding and true philosophers, on account of the ingenious
process employed here to supply the place of the sense of seeing by that of
hearing, and speech by gesture and writing.</p>
<p>I must not conceal from my countrymen, above all, that the Institutor, in
his public lessons, formally declares, that it is by giving to the French
language the simple form of ours, and accommodating to it our syntax, he has
been chiefly successful in making the deaf and dumb understand that of their
own country. I must also add, that it is no more than a justice due to the
Institutor to say that, in the midst of the concourse of auditors, who press
round him, and who offer him the homage due to his genius and philanthropy, he
shews for all the English an honourable preference, acknowledging to them,
publicly, that this attention is a debt which he discharges in return for the
asylum that we granted to the unfortunate persons of his profession, who,
emigrating from their native land, came among us to seek consolation, and found
another home.</p>
<p>Should ever this feeble sketch of so interesting an institution reach
SICARD, that religious philosopher, who belongs as much to every country in the
world as to France, the land which gave him birth, he will find in it nothing
more than the expression of the gratitude of one Englishman; but he may promise
himself that as soon as the definitive treaty of peace shall have reopened a
free intercourse between the two nations, the sentiments contained in it will
be adopted by all the English who shall witness the extraordinary success of
his profoundly-meditated labours. They will all hasten to pay their tribute of
admiration to a man, whose most gratifying reward consists in the benefits
which he has had the happiness to confer on that part of his fellow-creatures
from whom Nature has withheld her usual indulgence.</p>
<h2><a name="let39">LETTER XXXIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 25, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Much has been said of the general tone of immorality now prevailing in this
capital, and so much, that it becomes necessary to look beyond the surface, and
examine whether morals be really more corrupt here at the present day than
before the revolution. To investigate the subject through all its various
branches and ramifications, would lead me far beyond the limits of a letter. I
shall therefore, as a criterion, take a comparative view of the increase or
decrease of the different classes of women, who, either publicly or privately,
deviate from the paths of virtue. If we begin with the lowest rank, and ascend,
step by step, to the highest, we first meet with those unfortunate creatures,
known in France by the general designation of</p>
<p class="center">PUBLIC WOMEN.</p>
<p>Their number in Paris, twelve years ago, was estimated at thirty thousand;
and if this should appear comparatively small, it must be considered how many
amorous connexions here occupy the attention of thousands of men, and
consequently tend to diminish the number of <i>public</i> women.</p>
<p>The question is not to ascertain whether it be necessary, for the
tranquillity of private families, that there should be public women. Who can
fairly estimate the extent of the mischief which they produce, or of that which
they obviate? Who can accurately determine the best means for bringing the good
to overbalance the evil? But, supposing the necessity of the measure, would it
not be proper to prevent, as much as possible, that complete mixture by which
virtuous females are often confounded with impures?</p>
<p>Charlemagne, though himself a great admirer of the sex, was of that opinion.
He had, in vain, endeavoured to banish entirely from Paris women of this
description; by ordering that they should be condemned to be publicly whipped,
and that those who harboured them, should carry them on their shoulders to the
place where the sentence was put in execution. But it was not a little singular
that, while the emperor was bent on reforming the morals of the frail fair, his
two daughters, the princesses Gifla and Rotrude, were indulging in all the
vicious foibles of their nature.</p>
<p>Charlemagne, who then resided in the <i>Palais des Thermes</i>, situated in
the <i>Rue de la Harpe</i>, happened to rise one winter's morning much earlier
than usual. After walking for some time about his room, he went to a window
which looked into a little court belonging to the palace. How great was his
astonishment, when, by the twilight, he perceived his second daughter, Rotrude,
with Eginhard, his prime minister, on her back, whom she was carrying through
the deep snow which had fallen in the night in order that the foot-steps of a
man might not be traced.</p>
<p>When Lewis the <i>débonnaire</i>, his successor, ascended the throne, he
undertook to reform these two princesses, whose father's fondness had prevented
him from suffering them to marry. The new king began by putting to death two
noblemen who passed for their lovers, thinking that this example would
intimidate, and that they would find no more: but it appears that he was
mistaken, for they were never at a loss. Nor is this to be wondered at, as
these princesses to a taste for literature joined a very lively imagination,
and were extremely affable, generous, and beneficent; on which account, says
Father Daniel, they died universally regretted.</p>
<p>Experience having soon proved that public women are a necessary evil in
great cities, it was resolved to tolerate them. They therefore began to form a
separate body, became subject to taxes, and had their statutes and judges. They
were called <i>femmes amoureuses</i>, <i>filles folles de leur corps</i>, and,
on St. Magdalen's day, they were accustomed to form annually a solemn
procession. Particular streets were assigned to them for their abode; and a
house in each street, for their commerce.</p>
<p>A penitentiary asylum, called <i>les Filles Dieu</i>, was founded at Paris
in 1226, and continued for some years open for the reception of <i>female
sinners who had gone astray, and were reduced to beggary</i>. In the time of
St. Lewis, their number amounted to two hundred; but becoming rich, they became
dissolute, and in 1483, they were succeeded by the reformed nuns of
Fontevrault.</p>
<p>When I was here in the year 1784, a great concourse of people daily visited
this convent in order to view the body of an ancient virgin and martyr, said to
be that of St. Victoria, which, having been lately dug up near Rome, had just
been sent to these nuns by the Pope. This relic being exposed for some time to
the veneration and curiosity of the Parisian public, the devout wondered to see
the fair saint with a complexion quite fresh and rosy, after having been dead
for several centuries, and, in their opinion, this was a miracle which
incontestably proved her sanctity. The incredulous, who did not see things in
the same light, thought that the face was artificial, and that it presented one
of those holy frauds which have so frequently furnished weapons to impiety. But
they were partly mistaken: the nuns had thought proper to cover the face of the
saint with a mask, and to clothe her from head to foot, in order to skreen from
the eyes of the public the hideous spectacle of a skeleton.</p>
<p>In 1420, Lewis VIII, with a view of distinguishing impures from modest
women, forbade the former to wear golden girdles, then in fashion. This
prohibition was vain, and the virtuous part of the sex consoled themselves by
the testimony of their conscience, whence the old proverb: "<i>Bonne rénommée
vaut mieux que ceinture dorée</i>."</p>
<p>Another establishment, first called <i>Les Filles pénitentes ou
repenties</i>, and afterwards <i>Filles de St. Magloire</i>, was instituted in
1497 by a Cordelier, and had the same destination. He preached against
libertinism, and with such success, that two hundred dissolute women were
converted by his fervent eloquence. The friar admitted them into his
congregation, which was sanctioned by the Pope. Its statutes, which were drawn
up by the Bishop of Paris, are not a little curious. Among other things, it was
established, that "none should be received but women who had led a dissolute
life, and that, in order to ascertain the fact, they should be examined by
matrons, who should swear on the Holy Evangelists to make a faithful
report."</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that women were well taken care of in this house,
since it was supposed that virtue even might assume the mask of vice to obtain
admission. The fact is singular. "To prevent girls from prostituting themselves
in order to be received, those who shall have been once examined and refused,
shall be excluded for ever.</p>
<p>"Besides, the candidates shall be obliged to swear, under penalty of their
eternal damnation, in presence of their confessor and six nuns, that they did
not prostitute themselves with a view of entering into this congregation; and
in order that women of bad character may not wait too long before they become
converted, in the hope that the door will always be open to them, none will be
received above the age of thirty."</p>
<p>This community, for some years, continued tolerably numerous; but its
destination had been changed long before the suppression of convents, which
took place in the early part of the revolution. All the places of public
prostitution in Paris, after having been tolerated upwards of four hundred
years, were abolished by a decree of the States General, held at Orleans in
1560. The number of women of the town, however, was far from being diminished,
though their profession was no longer considered as a trade; and as they were
prohibited from being any where, that is, in any fixed place, they were
compelled to spread themselves every where.</p>
<p>At the present day, the number of these women in Paris is computed at
twenty-five thousand: they are taken up as formerly, in order to be sent into
infirmaries, whence they, generally, come out only to return to their former
habits. Twelve years ago, those apprehended underwent a public examination once
a month, and were commonly sentenced to a confinement, more or less long,
according to the pleasure of the minister of the police. The examination of
them became a matter of amusement for persons of not over-delicate feelings.
The hardened females, neither respecting the judge not the audience, impudently
repeated the language and gestures of their traffic. The judge added a
fortnight's imprisonment for every insult, and the most abandoned were confined
only a few months longer in the <i>Salpétrière</i>.</p>
<p>Endeavours have since been made to improve the internal regulation of this
and similar houses of correction; but, as far as my information goes, with
little success. For want of separating, from the beginning of their
confinement, the most debauched from those whom a moment of distress or error
has thrown into these scenes of depravity, the contamination of bad example
rapidly spreads, and those who enter dissolute, frequently come out thievish;
while all timidity is banished from the mind of the more diffident. Besides, it
is not always the most culpable who fall into the hands of the police, the more
cunning and experienced, by contriving to come to terms with its agents,
employed on these errands, generally escape; and thus the object in view is
entirely defeated.</p>
<p>On their arrival at the <i>Salpétrière</i>, the healthy are separated from
the diseased; and the latter are sent to <i>Bicêtre</i>, where they either find
a cure or death. Your imagination will supply the finishing strokes of this
frightful picture.&mdash;These unfortunate victims of indigence or of the
seduction of man, are deserving of compassion. With all their vices, they have,
after all, one less than many of their sex who pride themselves on chastity,
without really possessing it; that is, hypocrisy. As they shew themselves to be
what they really are, they cannot make the secret mischief which a detected
prude not unfrequently occasions under the deceitful mask of modesty. Degraded
in their own eyes, and being no longer able to reign through the graces of
virtue, they fall into the opposite extreme, and display all the audaciousness
of vice.</p>
<p>The next class we come to is that which was almost honoured by the Greeks,
and tolerated by the Romans, under the denomination of</p>
<p class="center">COURTESANS.</p>
<p>By courtesans, I mean those ladies who, decked out in all the luxury of
dress, if not covered with diamonds, put up their favours to the highest
bidder, without having either more beauty or accomplishments, perhaps, than the
distressed female who sells hers at the lowest price. But caprice, good
fortune, intrigue, or artifice, sometimes occasions an enormous distance
between women who have the same views.</p>
<p>If the ancients made great sacrifices for the Phrynes, the Laïses, or the
Aspasias of the day, among the moderns, no nation has, in that respect,
surpassed the French. Every one has heard of the luxurious extravagance of
Mademoiselle Deschamps, the cushion of whose <i>chaise-percée</i>, was trimmed
with point-lace of very considerable value, and the harness of whose carriage
was studded with paste, in imitation of diamonds. This woman, however, lived to
repent of her folly; and if she did not literally die in a poorhouse, she at
least ended her days in wretchedness.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, of all the gay ladies in Paris, Madame Grandval
displayed the greatest luxury in her equipage; and Mademoiselle D'Hervieux, in
her house. I knew them both. The former I have seen at Longchamp, as well as at
the annual review of the king's household troops, in a splendid coach, as fine
as that of any Lord Mayor, drawn by a set of eight English grays, which cost a
hundred and twenty guineas a horse. She sat, like a queen, adorned with a
profusion of jewels; and facing her was a <i>dame de compagnie</i>,
representing a lady of the bedchamber. Behind the carriage, stood no less than
three tall footmen, besides a chasseur, in the style of that of the Duke of
Gloucester, in rich liveries, with swords, canes, and bags.</p>
<p>As for the house of Mademoiselle D'Hervieux, it was every thing that
oriental luxury, combined with French taste, could unite on a small scale.
Although of very low origin, and by no means gifted with a handsome person,
this lady, after having, rather late in life, obtained an introduction on the
opera-stage as a common <i>figurante</i>, contrived to insinuate herself into
the good graces of some rich protectors. On the <i>Chaussée d'Antin</i>, they
built for her this palace in miniature, which, twelve years ago, was the object
of universal admiration, and, in fact, was visited by strangers as one of the
curiosities of Paris.</p>
<p>At the present day, one neither sees nor hears of such favourites of
fortune; and, for want of subjects to paint under this head, I must proceed to
those of the next rank, who are styled</p>
<p class="center">KEPT WOMEN.</p>
<p>What distinctions, what shades, what different names to express almost one
and the same thing! From the haughty fair in a brilliant equipage, figuring,
like a favourite Sultana, with "all the pride, pomp, and circumstance" of the
toilet, down to the hunger-pinched female, who stands shivering in the evening
at the corner of a street, what gradations in the same profession!</p>
<p>Before the revolution, there were reckoned in Paris eight or ten thousand
women to whom the rich nobility or financiers allowed from a thousand pounds a
year upwards to an almost incredible amount. Some of these ladies have ruined a
whole family in the short space of six months; and, having nothing left at the
year's end, were then under the necessity of parting with their diamonds for a
subsistence. Although many of them are far inferior in opulence to the
courtesans, they are less depraved, and, consequently, superior to them in
estimation. They have a lover, who pays, and from whom they, in general, get
all they can, at the same time turning him into ridicule, and another whom, in
their turn, they pay, and for whom they commit a thousand follies.</p>
<p>These women used to have no medium in their attachments; they were either
quite insensible to the soft passion, or loved almost to distraction. On the
wane, they had the rage for marrying, and many of them found men who,
preferring fortune to honour, disgraced themselves by such alliances. Some of
these ladies, if handsome, were not unfrequently taken by a man of fortune, and
kept from mere ostentation, just as he would sport a superlatively elegant
carriage, or ride a very capital horse; others were maintained from caprice,
which, like Achilles's spear, carried with it its own antidote; and then, of
course, they passed into the hands of different keepers. It cannot be denied,
however that a few of these connexions were founded on attachment; and when the
woman, who was the object of it, was possessed of understanding, she assumed
the manners and deportment of a wife. Indeed, now and then a keeper adopted the
style of oriental gallantry.</p>
<p>Beaujon, the banker of the court, who had amassed an immense fortune,
indulged himself in his old age, and, till his death, in a society composed of
pretty women, some of whom belonged to what was then termed good families,
among which he had diffused his presents. In an elegant habitation, called
<i>la Chartreuse</i>, which he erected in the <i>Faubourg du Roule</i>, as a
place of occasional retirement, was a most curious apartment, representing a
bower, in the midst of which was placed a bedstead in imitation of a basket of
flowers: four trees, whose verdant foliage extended over part of the ceiling,
which was painted as a sky, seemed to shade this basket, and supported drapery,
suspended to their branches. This was M. Beaujon's Temple of Venus.</p>
<p>The late Prince of Soubise, for some years, constantly kept ten or a dozen
ladies. The only intercourse he had with them, was to breakfast or chat with
them twice or thrice a month, and latterly he maintained several old stagers,
in this manner, from motives of benevolence. At the end of the month, all these
ladies came in their carriages at a fixed hour, in a string, as it were, one
after the other. The steward had their money ready; they afterwards, one by
one, entered a very spacious room furnished with large closets, filled with
silks, muslins, laces, ribbands, &amp;c. The prince distributed presents to
each, according to her age and taste: thus ended a visit of mere ceremony,
interspersed with a few words of general gallantry.</p>
<p>Such was the style in which many women were kept by men of fortune under the
old <i>régime</i>. At the present day, if we except twenty or thirty perhaps,
it would be no easy matter to discover any women supported in a style of
elegance in Paris, and the lot of these seems scarcely secured but from month
to month. The reason of this mystery is, that the modern Cr&oelig;suses having
mostly acquired their riches in a clandestine manner, they take every possible
precaution to prevent the reports in circulation concerning their ill-gotten
pelf from being confirmed by a display of luxury in their <i>chères amies</i>.
On this account, many a matrimonial connexion, I am told, is formed between
them and women of equivocal character, on the principle, that a man is better
able to check the extravagant excesses of his wife than those of his
mistress.</p>
<p>We now arrive at that class of females who move in a sphere of life the best
calculated for making conquests. I mean</p>
<p class="center">OPERA-DANCERS.</p>
<p>When a spectator, whose eyes are fascinated by the illusion of scenic
decorations, contemplates those beauties whose voluptuous postures, under the
form of Calypso, Eucharis, Delphis, &amp;c. awaken desire in the mind of youth,
and even of persons of maturer years, he forgets that the divinities before him
are women, who not unfrequently lavish their favours on the common herd of
mortals. His imagination lends to them a thousand secret charms which they
possess not; and he cannot be persuaded that they are not tremblingly alive to
a passion which they express with so much apparent feeling. It is in their arms
only that he discovers his error. To arrive at this point, many an Englishman
has sacrificed thousands of pounds; while his faithless fair has been indulging
in all the wantonness of her disposition, perhaps, with some obscure Frenchman
among the long train of her humble admirers. Hence the significant appellation
of <i>Milord Pot-au-feu</i>, given to one who supports a woman whose favours
another enjoys <i>gratis</i>.</p>
<p>Such an opera-dancer used formerly to exhibit herself in a blaze of jewels
in the lobby, and according to the style in which she figured, did she obtain
respect from her companions. The interval between them was proportioned to the
degree of opulence which the one enjoyed over the other, so that the richer
scarcely appeared to belong to the same profession as the poorer. To the
former, every shopkeeper became a candidate for custom; presents were heaped on
presents, and gold was showered on her in such a manner that she might, for the
time, almost have fancied herself a second Danaë.</p>
<p>In the midst of this good fortune, perhaps, an obscure rival suddenly
started into fashion. She then was eclipsed by her whom, a few days before, she
disdained. Instead of a succession of visiters, her house was deserted; and, at
the expiration of the year, the proud fair, awakened from her golden dream by
the clamours of her importunate creditors, found herself without one friend to
rescue her valuables from their rapacious gripe.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that this order of things, (excepting the reverse by which
it was sometimes followed) was very agreeable to the great majority of these
capering beauties, and, doubtless, they wished its duration. For, among the
reports of the <i>secret</i> police, maintained by Lewis XVI, in 1792, it
appears by a letter addressed to M. de Caylus, and found among the King's
papers in the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, that most of the female
opera-dancers were staunch <i>aristocrates</i>; but that democracy triumphed
among the women who sang at that theatre. This little anecdote shews how far
curiosity was then stretched to ascertain what is called public opinion; and I
have no doubt that the result confirmed the correctness of the statement.</p>
<p>The opera-stage was certainly never so rich as it now is in first-rate
female dancers, yet the frail part of these beauties were never so deficient,
perhaps, in wealthy admirers. Proceeding to the next order of meretricious
fair, we meet with that numerous one denominated</p>
<p class="center">GRISETTES.</p>
<p>This is the name applied to those young girls who, being obliged to subsist
by their labour, chiefly fill the shops of milliners, mantua-makers, and
sellers of ready-made linen, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The rank which ought to be assigned to them, I think, is between
opera-dancers and demireps. You may smile at the distinction; but, as Mr.
Tickle justly observes, in the Spectator, we should vary our appellations of
these fair criminals, according to circumstances. "Those who offend only
against themselves," says he, "and are not a scandal to society; but, out of
deference to the sober part of the world, have so much good left in them as to
be ashamed, must not be comprehended in the common word due to the worst of
women. Regard is to be had to their situation when they fell, to the uneasy
perplexity in which they lived under senseless and severe parents, to the
importunity of poverty, to the violence of a passion in its beginning
well-grounded, to all the alleviations which make unhappy women resign the
characteristic of their sex, modesty. To do otherwise than thus," adds he,
"would be to act like a pedantic Stoic, who thinks all crimes alike, and not
as an impartial spectator, who views them with all the circumstances that
diminish or enhance the guilt."</p>
<p>If we measure them by this standard, <i>grisettes</i> appear entitled to be
classed immediately below demireps; for, as Lear says of his daughter,</p>
<p class="bq">"-------- Not to be the worst<br />
Stands in some rank of praise."</p>
<p>Their principal merit consists in their conducting themselves with a certain
degree of decorum and reserve, and in being susceptible of attachment. Born in
an humble sphere, they are accustomed from their infancy to gain their
livelihood by their industry. Like young birds that feel the power of using
their wings, they fly from the parent-nest at the age of sixteen; and, hiring a
room for themselves, they live according to their means and fancy.</p>
<p>More fortunate in their indigence than the daughters of petty tradesmen,
they overleap the limits of restraint, while their charms are in full lustre;
and sometimes their happiness arises from being born in poverty. In marrying an
artisan of their own class, they see nothing but distress and servitude, which
are by no means compatible with their spirit of independence. Vanity becomes
their guide, and is as bad a guide as distress; for it prompts them to add the
resources of their youth and person to those of their needle. This double
temptation is too strong for their weak virtue. They therefore seek a friend to
console them on Sundays for the <i>ennui</i> of the remainder of the week,
which must needs seem long, when they are sitting close at work from morning to
night. In general, they are more faithful than any of the other classes of the
frail part of the sex, and may be supported at little expense, and without
scandal.</p>
<p>It would require almost the powers of the inquisition to ascertain whether
<i>grisettes</i> have increased or diminished since the revolution; but their
number is, and always has been, immense in Paris. An object highly deserving of
the attention of the French legislators would be to find a remedy for this
evil. A mortal blow should, no doubt, be struck at the luxury of the toilet; as
the rage for dress has, I am convinced, undermined the virtue of as many women
as the vile stratagems of all the Lotharios in being. Leaving these matters to
some modern Lycurgus, I shall end my letter. But, in my eager haste to close
it, I must not omit a class, which has increased in a proportion equal to the
decrease of kept women. As they have no precise designation in France, I shall
take the liberty of applying to them, that of</p>
<p class="center">DEMIREPS.</p>
<p>Without having the shameless effrontery of vice, these ladies have not the
austere rigour of virtue. Seeing that professed courtesans insnared the most
promising youths, and snatched them from other women, this description of
females sprang up, in a manner, to dispute with them, under the rose, the
advantages which the others derived from their traffic. If they have not the
same boldness in their carriage, their looks bespeak almost as much
complaisance. They declaim loudly against women of all the classes
before-mentioned, for the best possible reason; because these are their more
dangerous rivals. It is certain that a virtuous woman cannot hold the breach of
chastity too much in abhorrence, but every Lucretia ought to have "a tear for
pity," especially towards the fallen part of her sex. Nothing can be more
disgusting than to hear women, who are known to have transgressed, forget their
own frailties, and rail against the more unguarded, and, consequently, more
artless part of womankind, without mercy or justice.</p>
<p>Demireps, in general, profess the greatest disinterestedness in their
connexions; but if they receive no money at the moment of granting their
favours, they accept trinkets and other presents which have some value. It is
not at all uncommon for a man to think that he has a <i>bonne fortune</i>, when
he finds himself on terms of intimacy with such a woman. Enraptured at his
success, he repeats his visits, till one day he surprises his belle,
overwhelmed by despair. He eagerly inquires the cause. After much entreaty, she
informs him that she has had ill luck at play, and, with anguish in her looks,
laments that she is ruined beyond redemption. The too credulous admirer can do
no less than accommodate her secretly with a sufficient sum to prevent her from
being taken to task by her husband; and thus the disinterested lady proves, in
the end, a greater drain to the gallant's pocket than the most mercenary
courtesan.</p>
<p>The man who would wish to recommend himself to their favour, scarcely need
take any further trouble than to change some of their trinkets, which are no
longer in fashion. Sometimes he may meet with a husband, who, conniving at his
wife's infidelity, will shew him every mark of attention. In that case, the
lover is quite at home, and his presence being equally agreeable to the
obliging husband as to the kind wife, when they are all three assembled, they
seem to fit their several places like the three sides of an equilateral
triangle.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, the increase of demireps is said to have diminished
most sensibly the class of what are termed kept women. Indeed, it is affirmed
by some, that the number of the former has, within these few years, multiplied
in a tenfold proportion. Others again maintain that it is no greater than it
was formerly; because, say they, the state of society in Paris is not near so
favourable to amorous intrigue as that which existed under the old
<i>régime</i>. Riches being more equally divided, few persons, comparatively
speaking, are now sufficiently affluent to entertain large parties, and give
routs, balls, and suppers, where a numerous assemblage afforded, to those
inclined to dissipation, every opportunity of cultivating an intimate
acquaintance. I must confess that these reasons, assigned by some worthy
Frenchmen whose opinions I respect, do not altogether accord with the result of
my observation; and, without taking on myself to controvert them, I am
persuaded that truth will bear me out in asserting, that, if the morals of that
class of society in which I have chiefly mixed during the different periods of
my stay in France, are not deteriorated, they are certainly not improved since
I last visited Paris.</p>
<p>After having painted, in regular succession, and with colours occasionally
borrowed, the general portrait of all those classes of females whose likeness
every English traveller has, no doubt, met with, I must find a little corner of
my canvass for a small number of women who might, probably, be sought in vain
out of Paris. However great a recommendation their rarity may be in the eyes of
some, still it is not the only quality that points them out to the notice of
the impartial observer.</p>
<p>When a man has come to his senses respecting the sex, or, according to the
vulgar adage, sown his wild oats, he naturally seeks a sincere friend to whom
he can unbosom himself with confidence. Experience warns him that few men are
to be trusted; and unless he has had the good fortune to meet with a virtuous
wife, blessed with an engaging temper and a good understanding, he must even,
like Junius, be the depository of his own secret. In Paris, however, he may
find one of those scarce females, who, being accustomed early in life to
reflection, possess the firm mind of a man, combined with the quick sensibility
of a woman.</p>
<p>When the illusion of the first passions is dissipated, their reason becomes
unclouded. Renouncing every narrow thought, they raise themselves to the
knowledge of the most weighty affairs, and, by an active observation of
mankind, are accustomed to discriminate every shade of character. Hence their
penetration is great; and they are capable of giving good advice on important
occasions. In short, a French woman at thirty makes an excellent friend, and,
attaching herself to the man she esteems, thinks no sacrifice too great for the
advancement of his interest, or the security of his happiness or
reputation.</p>
<p>The friendship between man and woman is a thousand times more sweet than
that between one man and another. A woman's friendship is active, vigilant, and
at the same time tender. French women cherish more sincerely their old friends
than their young lovers. They may perchance deceive the lover, but never the
friend; the latter they consider as a sacred being. Whence, no doubt, Rousseau
(who has not spared the Parisian ladies) has been led to say: "I would never
have sought in Paris a wife, still less a mistress; but I would willingly have
made there a female friend; and this treasure would, perhaps, have consoled me
for not finding the other two."</p>
<h2><a name="let40">LETTER XL.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 27, 1801.</i></p>
<p>About thirty years ago, a public insult offered to human nature, in the
person of some unfortunate blind men belonging to the Hospital of the
<i>Quinze-vingts</i>, and repeated daily for the space of two months, suggested
to a spectator the idea of avenging it in a manner worthy of a true
philanthropist.</p>
<p>In a coffeehouse of the <i>Foire St. Ovide</i>, in Paris, were placed ten
blind beggars, muffled up in grotesque dresses and long pointed caps, with
large paste-board spectacles on their nose, without glass: music and lights
were set before them; and one of them was characterized as Midas, with the ears
of an ass, and the addition of a peacock's tail, spread behind him. He sang,
while all the others played the same parts of a monotonous tune, without either
taste or measure; and the unfeeling public turned into derision the unfortunate
actors in this infamous scene. This happened in September 1771.</p>
<p>From that moment, M. VALENTIN HAÜY, brother to the celebrated mineralogist
of that name, animated by a noble enthusiasm, conceived the project of teaching
the blind to write and read, and of placing in their hands books and music,
printed by themselves. After employing twelve years in maturing it, at length,
in 1784, he ventured to carry it into execution. To so laudable and benevolent
a purpose, he devoted all his fortune; and hence originated the establishment
known in Paris, since the year 1791, by the title of</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL INSTITUTION OF THE INDUSTRIOUS BLIND.</p>
<p>Presently M. HAÜY found his plan seconded by the Philanthropic Society, and
the benefactions and advice of several persons, no less distinguished for
understanding than benevolence, contributed not a little to encourage his zeal
in its prosecution. The following were the primary objects of the
establishment.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>To withdraw the blind from the dangerous paths of idleness.</li>
<li>To procure them certain means of subsistence by the execution of pleasant
and easy labours.</li>
<li>To restore them to society.</li>
<li>To console them for their misfortune.</li>
</ol>
<p>To rescue the blind from idleness is, unquestionably, of itself a great
blessing, as it preserves them from an infinite number of vices, and
consequently must be approved by the moralist. But another advantage, equally
deserving of approbation, is to cause them to find, in their labour, an
infallible resource against indigence. Previously to the execution of this
beneficent plan, a young blind child, born of poor parents, was reduced to the
melancholy and humiliating necessity of standing in a public thoroughfare,
exposed to all the inclemency of the weather, to beg its bread, and, at
present, it has no occasion to owe its livelihood but to its own labour.</p>
<p>The children that M. HAÜY had to educate were, in general, of the class of
artisans, though a few belonged to that of artists and men of science. Some
were born with a little aptitude for mechanical labours, others with a great
disposition for the arts and sciences. These considerations naturally pointed
out to him his plan of instruction, which is divided into four branches.</p>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><p>Handicraft work, viz. Spinning, knitting, making of cord, fringe,
trimming, ribband, pasteboard, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Task-masters direct the execution of these works, which are as easy to the
blind as to the clear-sighted.</p></li>
<li><p>Education, viz. Reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, literature,
history, foreign languages, arts and sciences.</p>
<p>This education of blind children is carried on by means of raised-work or
relief, and is intrusted to other blind people whose education is completed.
The latter not only instruct their unfortunate fellow-sufferers, but also the
clear-sighted.</p>
<p>The sense of feeling is so refined in blind children, that a pupil, a little
informed, becomes perfectly acquainted with maps by handling them: he points
out with his finger countries and towns; if a map is presented to him upside
down, he places it in a proper manner, and if one map is substituted to
another, he instantly discovers the deception.</p></li>
<li><p>Printing, viz. In black characters, for the public. In relief, for
themselves.</p>
<p>In black, they have printed no inconsiderable number of voluminous works,
for the use of the public. In relief, they have printed for themselves a
catechism, a grammar, and a great quantity of music. No where but at this
institution, and at the MUSEUM OF THE BLIND, of which I shall presently speak,
is there to be found an office for printing in relief.</p></li>
<li><p>Music, viz. Vocal and instrumental, and composition.</p>
<p>The music of the blind pupils has always been employed with the greatest
success in public festivals, playhouses, balls, coffeehouses, and many public
and private assemblies. It is impossible to form an adequate idea of the
decided taste of the blind for music, and of the consolation which it affords
them. Deprived of their eyes, they seem to become all ears.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>No sooner had M. HAÜY rendered public his first essays, than the learned,
and especially the members of the <i>ci-devant</i> Academy of Sciences, stamped
them with their approbation, as appears by a Report signed by some of the most
distinguished of that body, such as DESMARETS, LA ROCHEFOUCAULT, CONDORCET,
&amp;c. Professors of the arts, cultivated by his pupils, such as printing,
music, &amp;c. were equally eager to acknowledge to what an astonishing degree
the blind had succeeded in appropriating to themselves the enjoyment of those
arts. Three of the first master-printers in Paris certified the intelligence
and skill of the blind pupils; and a concert was executed by them to the no
small satisfaction of the <i>ci-devant</i> Academy of Music.</p>
<p>Persons of every degree now wished to be spectators of the result of these
essays. Lewis XVI sent for the Industrious Blind, their machinery, &amp;c. to
Versailles; he visited them when at work, and inspected their several
performances, attended by all the royal family, princes of the blood,
ministers, ambassadors, &amp;c. After having procured the inhabitants of that
town this interesting sight for several successive days, he rewarded the blind
with marks of his favour and encouragement.</p>
<p>The government, which succeeded to the monarchy, shewed no less interest in
the progress of M. HAÜY'S undertaking. The different legislatures, which have
successively governed France, promoted it by various decrees. In proportion as
the number of the pupils increased, so did the resources of their industrious
activity. By a law which was solicited by M. HAÜY, and which excited and kept
up a singular emulation among his pupils, the blind, in preference to the
clear-sighted of equal merit, were admitted to the various secondary
employments of the establishment. From that period, the first blind pupils,
formed by M. HAÜY, being promoted to the functions of teachers, transmitted
with success to young blind children, sent for instruction, from different
parts of the Republic, the first elements of education given them by himself
and assistants. By virtue of this law, the office of house-steward was
intrusted to LESUEUR, a blind pupil who had already discharged it with credit
at a banker's. It will scarcely be believed, no doubt, that a blind man can be
a cashier, receive money coming in, either from the public treasury, or from
the industry of his brothers in misfortune; make of it a suitable division; buy
commodities  necessary for life and clothing; introduce the strictest economy
into his disbursements; by means of his savings, procure the establishment the
implements and machinery of the Industrious Blind; in times of real scarcity,
make use of the productions of the labour of the grown blind, to maintain the
young blind pupils, and that, with all these concerns on his hands, his
accounts should always be ready for inspection.</p>
<p>M. HAÜY informs me that out of fifteen or twenty of his old pupils, whom he
has connected by the ties of marriage, ten or twelve are fathers; and that they
have children more fortunate than the authors of their days, since the enjoy
the benefit of sight. But the most interesting part of these connexions is,
that the blind father (on the principle of the plan before-stated) teaches his
clear-sighted son reading, arithmetic, music, and every thing that it is
possible to teach without the help of the eyes.</p>
<p>Raised work, or relief, is the simple and general process by means of which
M. HAÜY forms his pupils, and there are a great number of them whose abilities
would excite the pride of many a clear-sighted person. For instance, in
addition to the before-mentioned LESUEUR, who is an excellent geographer and a
good mathematician, might be quoted HUARD, a man of erudition and a correct
printer; likewise CAILLAT, a capital performer on the violin, and a celebrated
composer. For vocal and instrumental music, printing, and handicraft work,
there might be noticed thirty or forty, as well as ten or twelve for knowledge
relating to the sciences.</p>
<p>It may not be improper to observe, that M. HAÜY always first puts a frame
into the hands of his pupils, and that he has made a law, to which he
scrupulously adheres, not to lean too much towards the <i>agreeable</i> arts,
unless the pupil manifest for them a peculiar disposition.</p>
<p>Hence you may form an idea of the proficiency which these unfortunates
attain under the auspices of the benevolent M. HAÜY. In the compass of a
letter, or even of several letters, it is impossible to develope proceedings
which it is more easy to put into execution than to describe. The process alone
of printing in relief would require a vast number of pages, and some plates, in
order to make it perfectly intelligible; but the greater part of what composes
these branches of instruction is amply detailed in a work, which I shall
communicate to you, entitled "<i>Essai sur l'Éducation des Aveugles</i>,
<i>par</i> Valentin Haüy, <i>auteur de la manière de les instruire</i>,"
printed under the sanction of the <i>ci-devant</i> Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>By a law on public education, passed in July 1796, several establishments
were to be founded in favour of blind children, in the principal towns of the
Republic; but, in consequence of the political changes which have since
occurred in the government, it has never been carried into execution.</p>
<p>In October, 1800, the Consuls decreed that the <i>National Institution of
the Industrious Blind</i> should be united to the Hospital of the
<i>Quinze-vingts</i>, together with the soldiers who had lost their sight in
Egypt. M. HAÜY is shortly to be honoured by a pension, as a reward for the
services which he has bestowed on those afflicted with blindness. At the
present moment, he is engaged in founding a second establishment, of a similar
nature, which is to take the name of</p>
<p class="center">MUSEUM OF THE BLIND.</p>
<p>On my asking M. HAÜY, whether he would not retire, as it was intended he
should, on his pension? "This favour of the government," replied he, "I
consider as a fresh obligation, silently imposed on me, to continue to be of
service to the blind. The first establishment, supported and paid by the
nation, belonged to the poor. In forming the second," added he, "I have yielded
to the wishes of parents in easy circumstances, who were desirous of giving to
their blind children a liberal education."</p>
<p>I have already mentioned, that, agreeably to M. HAÜY'S plan, the blind
instruct the clear-sighted; and in this Museum, which is situated <i>Rue Sainte
Avoie, Hôtel de Mêsme, No. 19</i>, the former are to be seen directing a class
of fifty youths, whom they instruct in every branch before-mentioned, writing
excepted. It is also in contemplation to teach a blind pupil <i>pasigraphy</i>,
or universal language, invented by DEMAIMIEUX.</p>
<p>M. HAÜY details to strangers every part of his plan with the most patient
and obliging attention. When he had concluded, I could not avoid expressing a
wish that the art of instructing the blind in the fullest extent might be
speedily introduced among all nations. "After having paid to my country,"
rejoined M. HAÜY, "the merited homage of my invention, my anxiety to contribute
to the relief of the afflicted, wherever they may be found, gives birth to the
desire of propagating, as much as possible, an institution which enlightened
men and philanthropists have been pleased to recommend to the attention of
foreigners and to the esteem of my countrymen, as may be seen by consulting
different literary publications from the year 1785 down to the present time,
particularly the new French Encyclopædia, at the article <i>Aveugle</i>."</p>
<p>"I should," added he, "perform a task very agreeable to my feelings in
concurring, by my advice and knowledge, to lay in England the foundation of an
establishment of a description similar to either of those which I have founded
in Paris. One of my pupils in the art of instructing the blind, M. GRANCHER, a
member of several learned societies in France, and possessed of my means and
method, would voluntarily devote his talents and experience to the success of
such an undertaking, to which he is himself strongly attached through
philanthropy and zeal for my reputation."&mdash;"I am persuaded," interrupted
I, "that were the advantages of such an establishment made public in England,
it would receive the countenance and support of every friend of human
nature."&mdash;"It is an unquestionable fact," concluded M. Haüy, "that an
institution of fifty blind, well conducted, ought, by their labour, to produce
more than would defray its expenses. I have already even tried with success to
apply to the English tongue my method of reading, which is so contrived for the
French language, that I need not give more than two or three lessons to a blind
child, in order to enable him to teach himself to read, without the further
help of any master."</p>
<h2><a name="let41">LETTER XLI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 29, 1801.</i></p>
<p>Such a crowd of different objects present themselves to my mind, whenever I
sit down to write to you, that, frequently as I have visited the Grand French
Opera since my arrival here, I have been hesitating whether I should make it
the subject of this letter. However, as it is one of the first objects of
attraction to a stranger, and the first in a theatrical point of view, I think
you cannot be too soon introduced to a knowledge of its allurements.
<a name="let41fr1"></a>Let us then pass in review the</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE DES ARTS ET DE LA
REPUBLIQUE.[<a href="#let41f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>Previously to the revolution, the French opera-house, under the name of
<i>Académie Royale de Musique</i>, was situated on the Boulevard, near the
<i>Porte St. Martin</i>. Except the façade, which has been admired, there was
nothing very remarkable in the construction of this theatre, but the dispatch
with which it was executed.</p>
<p>The old opera-house in the <i>Palais Royal</i> having been burnt down on the
8th of June 1781, M. LENOIR, the architect, built a new one in the short space
of sixty days, and, within a fortnight after, it was decorated and opened. Had
an hospital been reduced to ashes, observes an able writer, it would have
required four years at least to determine on the eligibility of new
plans.&mdash;But a theatre, constructed with such expedition, excited
apprehensions respecting its stability: it was necessary to remove them, and,
by way of <i>trying the house</i>, the first representation was given
<i>gratis</i>. This had the desired effect: after having sustained the weight
of between two and three thousand market-women, oyster-wenches, shoe-blacks,
chimney-sweepers, porters, &amp;c, it was deemed sufficiently solid to receive
a more refined audience.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1793, the interior of this quickly-built
theatre was also destroyed by fire. But the opera experienced no interruption:
such an event would be regarded as a public calamity in the capital. In fact,
this expensive establishment affords employ to a vast number of persons. The
singers, dancers, musicians, machinists, painters, tailors, dress-makers,
scene-shifters, &amp;c. attached to it, would constitute a little nation. The
richness and variety of the dresses give activity to several branches of trade,
and its representations involve all the agreeable arts. These united
attractions captivate foreigners, and induce them to squander considerable sums
of money in the country. Hence, were the opera-house shut up, commerce would
suffer; there would be an absolute void in the pleasures of the Parisians; and,
as experience proves, these volatile people would sooner resign every thing
most valuable than any portion of their amusements. Besides, without such an
establishment, the talents of singers and dancers could not be maintained in
their present perfection. It holds out to them constant encouragement and
remuneration; while, compared to any other theatre, it excites in the
spectators a greater number of pleasing sensations. How then could it be
dispensed with?</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the disaster befell the theatre of the <i>Porte St.
Martin</i>, it was considered as a fortunate circumstance that the present
opera-house was just finished. The performers of the <i>ci-devant Académie de
Musique</i> immediately established themselves in this new asylum, which is
situated in the <i>Rue de la Loi</i>, facing the National Library, and opened
it to the public under the name of <i>Théâtre des Arts</i>. I must observe, by
the way, that, in France, all players, dancers, musicians, and every one who
exercises an art, are now styled <i>artistes</i>.</p>
<p>The form of this house is nearly a parallelogram: one of the shorter sides
is occupied by the stage, and the other three are slightly curved. In general,
one is ill placed here, except in the boxes in front of the stage, and in the
pit, the seats of which rise abruptly, in the manner of an amphitheatre, from
the orchestra to the first tier of boxes. The Chief Consul has chosen for
himself the stage-box, as I believe we term it in England, on the right hand of
the actors. It is elegantly decorated with scarlet velvet, embroidered in gold.
The ornaments (I am not speaking of the scenery) are neither of superlative
elegance, nor do they display extraordinary taste. The curtain, however, is
majestic and beautiful, as well as the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Here," says a French author, "arts, graces, genius, and taste conspire to
produce a most magnificent, a most brilliant, and most enchanting spectacle.
Here heroes come to life again to sing their love and their despair; here many
a goddess is seen to mix with mortals, many a Venus to descend from the radiant
Olympus in order to throw herself into the arms of more than one
Anchises."&mdash;Certainly, if splendid decorations, rich and appropriate
dresses, the most skilful machinists, the most distinguished composers, a
numerous and most select orchestra, some excellent actors, together with the
most celebrated dancers in Europe, of both sexes, constitute a brilliant
spectacle, this justly deserves that title. In these magnificent arrangements,
we see again the Grand French Opera, as it appeared in the most splendid days
of the monarchy. With the exception of the singing, every other department at
this theatre is much improved; the only drawback that I can discover at the
representation of the same pieces, which I have often seen here before the
revolution, consists in the exterior of the spectators. Between the acts, when
I transport myself in idea to the former period, and, looking round the house,
form a comparison, I find the republican audience far less brilliant, owing, no
doubt, to the absence of that glare of diamonds, embroidery, lace, and other
finery, which distinguished the frequenters of the opera under the old
government.</p>
<p>The performances at the opera being, in general, more calculated for
charming the eyes and ears, than gratifying the understanding, it is,
consequently, the most frequented of any of the capital.</p>
<p class="bq">"-------- With the many<br />
Action is eloquence, and th' eyes of th' ignorant<br />
More learned than their ears."</p>
<p>There is, however, no piece represented at this theatre that a stranger
ought not to see, either on account of the music, or of the spectacle and its
decorations. The operas, or lyric tragedies, which, from the number of times
they have been performed, appear to have obtained the greatest success, are
those of GLUCK. The originality, the energy, the force and truth of declamation
of this great musician were likely to render him successful, especially among
the French, who applauded the two last-mentioned qualities on their other
national theatre.</p>
<p>With the exception of one only, all the works of GLUCK have remained as
stock-pieces, and are played from time to time. They are five in number;
namely, <i>Iphigénie en Aulide</i>, <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i>, <i>Orphée et
Euridice</i>, <i>Armide</i>, and <i>Alceste</i>. That which could not maintain
its ground, and consequently fell, was <i>Narcisse</i>. The flimsiness of the
poem was the cause; for the music, I am assured, is the finest that GLUCK ever
composed, and several pieces of it have been repeatedly performed in the
Parisian concerts.</p>
<p>The <i>Didon</i> of PICCINI and the <i>&OElig;dipe à Colonne</i> of SACCHINI
have had no less success than the operas of GLUCK. They are very frequently
represented.</p>
<p>It may not, perhaps, be unseasonable to remind you that, from twenty to
twenty-five years ago, when the old operas of LULLI and RAMEAU were laid aside,
and replaced by modern works, two parties were formed, which, from the name of
the musician that each adopted, were called, the one, <i>Gluckists</i>; and the
other, <i>Piccinists</i>. Their inveteracy was great, somewhat like that which,
forty years before, existed between the <i>Molinists</i> and <i>Jansenists</i>:
and few persons, if any, I believe, remained neuter. Victory seems to have
crowned the former party. Indeed the music of GLUCK possesses a melody which is
wonderfully energetic and striking. PICCINI is skilful and brilliant in his
harmony, as well as sweet and varied in his composition; but this style of
beauty has been thought to be deficient in expression. Truth obliges me to say,
that, of PICCINI'S works, no opera is now played but his <i>Didon</i>, and that
his other productions, which, to the best of my recollection, are <i>Alys</i>,
an opera called <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i>, and <i>Pénélope</i>, have fallen.
This was ascribed to the mediocrity of the language; a part of an opera
somewhat essential, though no great attention seems to be bestowed on it. But
if people here are not very difficult as to the style of the language, they
require at least an action well conducted and interesting. When the piece is of
itself cold, it is not in the power of the finest music to give it warmth. The
<i>&OElig;dipe à Colonne</i> of SACCHINI is reckoned by many persons the
<i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of operas. That able musician has there excelled in
all that is graceful, noble, and pathetic; but it exhibits not the tragic fire
that is to be found in the works of GLUCK. SACCHINI has left behind him another
composition, called <i>Arvire et Evéline</i>, which, though a cold subject,
taken from the history of England, is held in estimation.</p>
<p>At this theatre are also performed what the French term <i>opéras de
genre</i>. These are a species of comic opera, in which is introduced a great
deal of show and bustle. <i>Panurge</i>, <i>La Caravanne</i>, <i>Anacréon</i>,
<i>Tarare</i>, <i>Les Prétendus</i>, <i>Les Mystères d'Isis</i>, &amp;c. are of
this description. The music of the first three is by GRÉTRY. It is considered
as replete with grace, charm, and truth of expression. The poem of
<i>Panurge</i> is an <i>estravaganza</i>. Those of the <i>Caravanne</i> and of
<i>Anacréon</i> are but indifferent. It required no small share of talent to
put words into the mouth of the charming poet, whose name is given to the
last-mentioned piece; but M. GUY appears not to have thought of this.
<i>Tarare</i> is a tissue of improbabilities and absurdities. The poem is
frequently nothing but an assemblage of words which present no meaning. It is a
production of the celebrated BEAUMARCHAIS, who has contrived to introduce into
it a sort of impious metaphysics, much in fashion here before the revolution.
The music is by SALIERI; it is very agreeable. The decorations are brilliant
and diversified. The piece is preceded by a prologue (which no other opera has)
representing the confusion and separation of the elements; and at the time of
its first appearance, I remember it was said that chaos was the image of the
author's head.</p>
<p><i>Les Prétendus</i> is a piece in one act, the plot of which is weak,
though of a gay cast. The music is charming. It is by LE MOYNE, who died a few
years ago, at an early period of life. <i>Les Mystères d'Isis</i>, which is now
the rage, is an incoherent parody from a German opera, called <i>the Enchanted
Flute</i>. To say that the music is by MOZART, dispenses me from any eulogium.
The decorations are extremely beautiful and varied: a scene representing
paradise is really enchanting.</p>
<p>After speaking of lyric tragedies, I should have mentioned those which are
either in rehearsal, or intended to be brought forward at this theatre. They
consist of <i>Hécube</i>, <i>Andromaque</i>, <i>Sémiramis</i>, and
<i>Tamerlan</i>. Although none of them are spoken of very highly, they will, in
all probability, succeed in a certain degree; for a piece scarcely ever has a
complete fall at the opera. This theatre has so many resources in the
decorations, music, and dancing, that a new piece is seldom destitute of
something worth seeing.</p>
<p>What, at the present day, proves the greatest attraction to the opera, is
the dancing. How bad soever may be a piece, when it is interspersed with fine
ballets, it is sure of having a certain run. Of these I shall say no more till
I come to speak of that department.</p>
<p>The weakest part of the performances at the opera is the singing. All are
agreed as to the mediocrity of the singers at this theatre, called
<i>lyric</i>. No one can say that, within the last ten or twelve years, they
are improved. To any person fond of the Italian style, it would be a sort of
punishment to attend while some of the singers here go through a scene. On the
stage of the French comic opera, it has been adopted, and here also a similar
change is required; but with the will to accomplish it, say its partisans, the
means, perhaps, might still be wanting. The greater part of the old performers
have lost their voice, and those who have not, do not appear to have
sufficiently followed the progress of modern taste to be able all at once to
embrace a new manner.</p>
<p>The first singer at the opera, in point of talent, is LAÏS. He even leaves
all the others far behind him, if we consider him only as a singer. He is a
<i>tenore</i>, according to the expression of the Italians, and a
<i>taille</i>, according to that of the French: in the <i>cantabile</i> or
graceful style, he is perfect; but he ought to avoid tragic pieces requiring
exertion, in which his voice, though flexible, is sometimes disagreeable, and
even harsh. Besides, he is absolutely deficient in nobleness of manner; and his
stature and countenance are better suited to low character. Indeed, he chiefly
performs in the operas termed here <i>opéras de genre</i>, such as
<i>Panurge</i>, <i>La Caravanne</i>, <i>Anacréon</i>, and <i>Les Prétendus</i>.
In these, his acting is correct, and his delivery judicious.</p>
<p>LAÏS is no less famous for the violence of his political opinions than for
his talents as a singer. At the period when the abettors of the reign of terror
were, in their turn, hunted down, for a long time he durst not appear on the
stage. He was accused by his brother performers of having said that the opera
would never go on well till a guillotine should be placed on the stage. This
stroke was levelled against the greater part of the actors and the musicians
belonging to the orchestra. However, as LAÏS could not be reproached with any
culpable <i>actions</i>, he found zealous defenders, and the public sacrificed
their resentment to their pleasure. This lenity appears not to have had on him
the effect which one would imagine. He still possesses every requisite for
singing well, but seems indifferent as to the means of pleasing, and exerts
himself but little.</p>
<p>If singers were esteemed by seniority, and perhaps by employment, LAINEZ
would be reckoned the first at this theatre. He is a counter-tenor, and
performs the parts of a lover. His voice is very strong, and, besides singing
through his nose, he screams loud enough to split one's ears. I have already
observed that the ears of a tasteful amateur would sometimes be shocked at this
theatre. The same remark, no doubt, was equally just some time ago; for J. J.
ROUSSEAU, when he was told that it was intended to restore to him the free
admission which he had enjoyed at the opera, replied that this was unnecessary,
because he had at the door of his country-residence the screech owls of the
forest of Montmorency. Those who are partial to LAINEZ think him an excellent
actor. This means that he has some warmth, and bestirs himself like a demoniac.
When the heroes of the opera wore hair-powder, nothing was more comic than to
see him shake his head, which was instantly enveloped in a cloud of dust. At
this signal the plaudits burst forth with great violence, and the would-be
singer, screaming with still greater loudness, seemed on the point of bursting
a blood-vessel.</p>
<p><a name="let41fr2"></a>It is reported that, not long since, a great
personage having sent for the <i>artists</i> belonging to the opera, said to
them, addressing himself to LAINEZ, "Gentlemen, do you intend to keep long your
old singers?"[<a href="#let41f2">2</a>] The same personage then turning round
to the dancers added, "As for you, gentlemen of the dance, none but compliments
can be paid to you."</p>
<p>LAFORÊT who (as the French express it), <i>doubles</i> LAINEZ, that is,
performs the same characters in his absence, has little more to recommend him
than his zeal. His voice is tolerably agreeable, but not strong enough for so
large a house. As an actor he is cold and aukward.</p>
<p>Next comes CHÉRON: he sings bass. His voice is strong, and the tone of it
sonorous and clear. However, it is thought to be weakened, and although this
singer sometimes throws out fine tones, he is reproached with a want of taste
and method. He is a sorry actor. Indeed, he very seldom makes his appearance,
which some attribute to idleness; and others, to his state of health. The
latter is likely to be occasionally deranged, as in point of epicurism, he has
as great a reputation as our celebrated Quin.</p>
<p>ADRIEN, who <i>doubles</i> CHÉRON, is an excellent actor; but his means do
not equal his intelligence. He presents himself wonderfully well; all his
movements, all his gestures have dignity, grace, and ease. There are, for the
same employment, other secondary singers, some of whom are by no means backward
in exertion, particularly DUFRESNE; but an impartial observer can say nothing
more in their commendation.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the qualifications of <i>Mesdames les
cantatrices</i>.</p>
<p>The first female singer at the opera is Mademoiselle MAILLARD. By means of a
rather pretty face, a clear voice, and a cabal of malcontents (for there are
some every where and in every line), she obtained loud applause, when she first
appeared some years ago as the rival of the charming ST. HUBERTI. Since the
revolution, France has lost this celebrated actress, and probably for ever. She
emigrated, and has since married the <i>ci-devant</i> Comte d'Antraigues.
Although she had not a powerful voice, she sang with the greatest perfection;
and her impressive and dignified style of acting was at least equal to her
singing.</p>
<p>At the present day, Mademoiselle MAILLARD has succeeded Madame ST. HUBERTI,
and is, as I have said, the first singer, in point of rank. She is become
enormous in bulk, and as the Italians express it, <i>canta a salti</i>. Her
powerful voice fills the house, but she is not unfrequently out of tune: her
declamation is noisy; while her masculine person gives her in all her motions
the air of a Bacchante. These qualities, no doubt, recommended her to the
notice of CHAUMETTE, the proclaimer of atheism, under whose auspices she more
than once figured as the goddess of reason. She has, nevertheless, occasionally
distinguished herself as an actress; and those who love noise, admire the
effect of her transitions. But I give the preference to Mademoiselle LATOUR,
who has a melodious pipe, which you will probably hear, as it is said that she
has not retired from the stage, where she frequently reminded the public of the
fascinating ST. HUBERTI, particularly in the character of <i>Didon</i>.</p>
<p>Since the prolonged absence of Mademoiselle LATOUR, Madame BRANCHU
<i>doubles</i> Mademoiselle MAILLARD. She is of much promise both as a singer
and actress. Her voice is agreeable, but not extensive.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle ARMAND is another most promising singer, who has a more
powerful organ than Madame BRANCHU, and when she has perfectly acquired the art
of modulating it, will, doubtless, prove a very valuable acquisition to this
theatre. Her voice has much sweetness, and sometimes conveys to the ear the
most flattering sounds, as its low tones are grave without being harsh, and its
high ones sonorous without being sharp. She seems to execute the most difficult
pieces of music with considerable ease; but she is deficient in action.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle HENRY is strong as to method, but weak as to means, in singing.
There are several other female singers; but, in my opinion, their merits do not
entitle them to particular mention.</p>
<p>Twelve or fourteen years ago, the opera was much better provided with
singers than it is at the present moment. Their voices, in every line of this
department, were well-toned and powerful. They easily reached the highest notes
according to the tone given by the diapason. Since then, the powers of most of
the singers who still remain on the stage have diminished, and those called in
to supply the place of such as are dead or have retired, are not near so rich
in voice as their predecessors. The diapason, however, has remained the same:
to this, in a great measure, may be attributed those shrieks and efforts which
disgust foreigners, unaccustomed to the French method. At the Parisian comic
opera, in consequence of a remonstrance from the principal singers, their
diapason has been lowered half a tone; and it seems necessary to examine
whether the same rule be not applicable to this theatre.</p>
<p>The choruses, notwithstanding, are now given here with more effect and
precision than I ever remember at any former period. In these, the ear is no
longer offended by exaggerated extensions of the voice, and, on the whole, they
are sung in a grand and graceful style.</p>
<p>The orchestra, which is ably led by REY, has also experienced a manifest
improvement. The principal musicians, I understand, have been recently changed;
and the first artists are engaged for the execution of the solos, and nothing
can now be wished for, either as to the spirit and correctness of the
overtures, or to the melody and taste of the accompaniments.</p>
<p>The Chief Consul is said to be particularly partial to Italian music. In
consequence, KREUTZER, a capital violin, and also a celebrated composer, has
been dispatched to Italy by the French government, for the express purpose of
selecting and purchasing the finest musical compositions which can be procured
in that land of harmony. Thus, the advice given by ROUSSEAU, in his
<i>Dictionnaire de Musique</i>, has at length been followed.</p>
<p>So much for the singing department of the opera, which, as you see, with
some exceptions, is but indifferent: in my next, I shall speak of the
dancing.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let41f1">Footnote 1</a>: Since the above letter was
written, this Lyric theatre has changed its name for that of <i>Théâtre de
l'Opéra</i>. This seems like one of the minor modifications, announcing the
general retrograde current setting towards the readoption of old habits; for
the denomination of <i>Théâtre des Arts</i> was certainly unobjectionable, as
poetry, music, dancing, painting, and mechanics, concurred in rendering more
pompous and more surprising the effects which a fertile genius, when governed
by reason, might assemble here for the gratification of the public. The
addition of the words <i>et de la République</i> was probably given to it from
patriotic zeal, at the time when the <i>Royal Academy of Music</i> was

<h2><a name="let42">LETTER XLII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 30, 1801</i>.</p>
<p>Dancing, like the other arts in France, has, during the revolution,
experienced the vicissitudes of this new order of things; but also, like the
other arts, it has made a progress equally astonishing and rapid. However, it
must not thence be inferred that dancing, particularly theatrical, had not
attained a certain degree of superiority long before the revolution; yet a most
evident improvement has been made in it, not only by the old-established
dancers, who then seemed almost to have done their best, but by the numerous
competitors who have since made their appearance.</p>
<p>It is not in the power of words to convey an adequate idea of the effect
produced on the senses by some of the ballets. In lieu of those whimsical
capers, forced attitudes, vague and undefined gestures of a set of dancers
whose movements had no signification, dancing now forms an animated, graceful,
and diversified picture, in which all the human passions are feelingly
pourtrayed. Their language is the more expressive from its being more refined
and concentrated. In the silence of pantomime, recourse is had to every
ingenious gesture, in order to impart to them greater force and energy; and, in
this mute play, restraint seems to kindle eloquence. Every motion has its
meaning; the foot speaks as well as the eye, and the sensations of the mind are
expressed by the attitudes of the body. A delicate sentiment is rendered with
the rapidity of lightning. Love, fear, hope, and despair, change countenances,
and say every thing that they wish to say, void of deceit, as if falsehood no
longer existed as soon as the mouth ceased to open.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that it was NOVERRE who first brought about in
France this reform in what were till then called ballets, without deserving the
title. He banished wigs, hoop-petticoats, and other preposterous habiliments,
and, by dint of superior genius, seconded by taste and perseverance, introduced
those historical pictures, replete with grace, expression, and sentiment, in
the room of the flat, insipid, and lifeless caricatures, which had hitherto
usurped admiration.</p>
<p>But, though NOVERRE, and, after him, the GARDELS, introduced on the Parisian
stage the pantomimic art in all the lustre in which it flourished on the
theatres of Greece and Rome, yet they had been anticipated by HILWERDING in
Germany, and ANGIOLINI in Italy, two celebrated men, who, in a distinguished
manner, laid the foundations of a species of modern entertainment, before known
only by the annals of ancient history. Those who have trod in their steps have
infinitely surpassed them in attractions, and, by their scientific
compositions, acquired a justly-merited reputation.</p>
<p>GARDEL, who, for the last fifteen years, has been the first dancer at the
opera, shews himself but seldom. After having, during that long period,
received the warmest and best deserved applause, either in the execution of the
noble style of dancing, or in the composition of ballets, he seems now to have
devoted himself almost exclusively to the last-mentioned branch of his art, and
the perfection to which he daily carries it, may well compensate the public for
the privation of his talents in the line of execution.</p>
<p>The most famous pantomimical ballets or <i>ballets d'action</i> (as they are
styled) now represented here, are <i>Psyché</i>, <i>Télémaque</i>, <i>Le
Jugement de Paris</i>, <i>Mirza</i>, and <i>la Dansomanie</i>. The impression
to which I have before alluded, is particularly observable during the
representation of the first three (composed by GARDEL), the charm of which
would be weakened by any attempt at description. No spectator, be his
disposition ever so cold and indifferent, can behold them unmoved. Every effort
of human skill and invention is exerted to excite astonishment and admiration.
The <i>ensemble</i> of the <i>spectacle</i> and decorations correspond to the
fertile genius of the author. It is the triumph of the art, and there may be
fixed the limits of pantomime, embellished by dancing. Nothing more perfect
than the rapid change of scenery. Meteors, apparitions, divinities borne on
clusters of clouds or in cars, appear and disappear, as if by enchantment,
exhibiting situations the most picturesque and striking.</p>
<p>BOULAY, the principal machinist, is, perhaps, the first in his line in
Europe. In the opera of <i>Armide</i>, I have seen him raise into the air
nearly one half of the theatre. He executes whatever is proposed to him, no
matter how difficult, and he is well seconded by the painters and draughtsmen.
The new decorations display much taste, and produce an effect truly
wonderful.</p>
<p>Had I not already made the remark, you might have concluded from the general
tenour of my observations, that the dancing forms the most brilliant part, of
the <i>spectacle</i> at this theatre, or, in other words, that the accessory
prevails over the main subject. It is no longer, as heretofore, a few capital
dancers of both sexes who form the ornament of the opera. Almost all the
competitors in this line are so many <i>virtuosi</i> who deserve and equally
participate the plaudits of the public. There is not among them any mediocrity.
The establishment of the <i>école de la danse</i> is for this theatre a
nursery, where Terpsichore finds, in great numbers, the most promising plants
for the decoration of her temple. It is saying little to affirm that nothing
equals the superiority of talents of this description which the opera
comprehends at the present moment. These advantages, I understand, are chiefly
due to GARDEL. He has given the example and the precept, and, through his
guidance, the art of dancing is become doubly captivating.</p>
<p>After having supplied most of the principal cities in Europe with capital
dancers, this theatre, far from being impoverished, is still in possession of a
numerous train of first-rate <i>artists</i> of both sexes in every style of
dancing. The men are GARDEL, MILON, ST. AMAND, DESHAIES, GOYON, BEAUPRÉ,
BRANCHU, BEAULIEU, AUMER, LÉON, TAGLIONI, DUPORT, and VESTRIS.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to speak of the talents of VESTRIS, as they are as well
known in London as in Paris. I shall therefore content myself with remarking
that he delights in exhibiting feats of agility; but as his age increases,
connoisseurs think that he declines a little. Nevertheless, he is still, in
reality, the first dancer at the opera. It is said that his son, ARMAND
VESTRIS, will, in time, be able to supply his place; in the mean while, DUPORT
bids fair to fill it, in case the "<i>Dieu de la danse</i>" should retire; not
to mention DESHAIES, who has lately met with an accident which has disabled him
for the present; but who, when on the stage in the presence of Vestris, has
shewn that he could also astonish and delight the spectators. Without having
the boldness of his rival, he exhibits more certainty and <i>à-plomb</i>. In
the character of <i>Télémaque</i>, he appears with all the grace of Apollo. If
excellence in dancing be allowed to consist less in the efforts of the dancer,
than in the ease and gracefulness of his attitudes, and the lightness and
precision of his steps, DESHAIES may he classed in the first rank of his
profession.</p>
<p><a name="let42fr1"></a>In this exercise, as in every thing else, there is a
just medium, and this is more particularly observed by the principal female
dancers. The names of these are GARDEL, CLOTILDE, CHEVIGNY, PÉRIGNON, COLLOMB,
CHAMEROI,[<a href="#let42f1">1</a>] SAULNIER, VESTRIS, DELISLE, MILLIÈRE,
LOUISE, FÉLICITÉ, DUPORT, TAGLIONI, ALINE, ÉTIENNE, JACOTOT, FLORINE, ADÈLE, to
whom may be added two most promising <i>débutantes</i>, LA NEUVILLE and
BIGOTINI, whose first appearance I witnessed.</p>
<p>Though Madame GARDEL, wife of the principal ballet-master, shines in
<i>demi-caractère</i>, her talents, in the different parts in which she is
placed, are above all panegyric. As NOVERRE has said somewhere of a famous
dancer, "she is always tender, always graceful, sometimes a butterfly,
sometimes a zephyr, at one moment inconstant, at another faithful; always
animated by a new sentiment, she represents with voluptuousness all the shades
of love." To sum up her merits, she is really in her art the female Proteus of
the lyric scene. Mademoiselle CLOTILDE is a tall, elegant woman, who dances in
the serious style. All her movements, made with precision, exhibit the
beautiful proportion of her finely-modelled figure; but, owing to her stature,
she appears to most advantage in pantomime, particularly in the character of
<i>Calypso</i> in the ballet of <i>Télémaque</i>. In the same ballet, MILLIÈRE,
in the part of <i>Eucharis</i>, displays her playful graces and engaging mien.
CHEVIGNY is full of expression in pantomime, and dances in great perfection,
notwithstanding her <i>embonpoint</i>. <a name="let42fr2"></a>PÉRIGNON and
COLLOMB are superior in the comic style, and all the others are not without
some peculiar exellence.[<a href="#let42f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>I should never finish, were I to attempt to particularize the merits of all
these fascinating women, who, as well as the men, have, of late, alternately
interchanged the characters they performed in the ballets of action. Even those
introduced occasionally in the fêtes given and received by the heroes in the
different operas, present a real contest, in which the first-rate dancers of
both sexes exert themselves to snatch the palm from their rivals. When a
theatre possesses such a richness, variety, and assemblage of talents in the
same art, it may boldly stylo itself the first in Europe. But I must confess
that an innovation has been introduced here which detracts much from what has
always been considered as fine dancing. I mean the mania of <i>pirouettes</i>.
This, however, seems less to be attributed to a decided <i>penchant</i> of the
dancers than to that of a new public, not yet familiarized to what constitutes
true taste.</p>
<p>During a revolution, every thing changes, every thing assumes a new face.
What was entitled to please yesterday in times of tranquillity, is to-day,
during the jar of public opinion, and will be to-morrow subject to all the
variations of caprice. The marvellous and gigantic usurp the place of the
natural, and claim alone the right to entertain. True it is that the dancers
have found means to render this new manner interesting, while they have enjoyed
the sweets of it. The pleasure of being applauded is so great, that it is no
easy matter to withstand the powerful allurement of the plaudits of a numerous
audience. Boileau has said, "<i>Aimez-vous la muscade? On en a mis par
tout</i>." The French dancers, following his example, have said, "<i>Aimez-vous
les pirouettes?</i>" The public have answered <i>oui</i>; and <i>pirouettes</i>
are all the rage.</p>
<p>When a certain king of Bisnagar sneezes, the court, the town, the provinces,
all the subjects of his empire, in short, sneeze in imitation of their monarch.
Without departing from my subject, I shall only observe that <i>pirouettes</i>,
like this sneezing, have found their way from the opera-stage into the circles
of every class of society in Paris. There lies the absurdity. The young
Frenchmen have been emulous to dance like dancers by profession; the women have
had the same ambition; and both men and women have, above all, been desirous to
shine like them in <i>pirouettes</i>. Thence most of the dances, formerly
practised in society, in which simple and natural grace was combined with a
certain facility and nobleness of execution, have been entirely laid aside. It
must be acknowledged, that, among the dancers in private company, there are
many, indeed, who, by dint of imitation and study, have attained a great degree
of perfection. But I now perceive that people here no longer dance for their
amusement; they dance to gratify their vanity, and many a person who has not
practised some hours in the morning under the tuition of his master, excuses
himself in the evening, pretends to be lame, and declines dancing.</p>
<p>The taste and elegance of the dresses of the opera-dancers, like those of
the heroes and heroines of the sock and buskin, leave nothing to be wished for.
<a name="let42fr3"></a>In lieu of drawers, which all women, without exception,
were formerly obliged to wear on the stage[<a href="#let42f3">3</a>], those who
dance have now substituted silk pantaloons, woven with feet, in order to serve
also as stockings. In some particular characters, they wear these of flesh
colour, and it is not then easy, at first sight, to distinguish whether it be
or be not the clothing of nature.</p>
<p>The French opera having been long considered as the grand national theatre,
it has ever been the pride of the government, whether monarchical or
republican, to support it in a manner worthy of the nation. In fact, the
disbursements are so great, that it would be impossible for the receipts to
cover them, though the performances are seldom suspended for more than two days
in the week, and the house is generally crowded. This theatre is managed by the
government, and on its account. The Minister of the Interior appoints a
commissioner to superintend its operations, and managers to conduct them.
During the old <i>régime</i>, the opera cost the crown annually from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres. What the extraordinary
expenses of this house are, under the present government, is not so easily
ascertained; but, from the best information that I have been able to procure,
their amount is from three to four hundred thousand francs a year. Here is a
considerable increase; but it must be remembered that the price of several
articles is now greatly augmented, if not doubled.</p>
<p>The receipt of the opera, on an average, used to be from twelve to fifteen
thousand livres a night; what it is at this day, is not positively known.
Formerly, the produce of the boxes, let by the year, was such, that nine
thousand livres were paid, in a manner, before the doors were thrown open. That
resource is almost void at present; nevertheless, this house being more
spacious than the old one, the prices of admission higher, and the performance,
perhaps, more constantly attended, the money taken at the door cannot well be
less than it was formerly. It then cost much less than it does now to bring out
a new piece. Thirty or forty thousand livres were sufficient for the production
of the most magnificent opera; while the disbursements to be made for
<i>Tamerlan</i> will, it is thought, amount to upwards of eighty thousand
francs. At this rate, the first representation of the <i>Mystères d'Isis</i>,
of which so much has been said, must have been attended with an expense of more
than a hundred thousand. Scandal whispers, that the managers of the opera are
rather partial to expensive pieces; but as they are accountable for their
conduct to the Minister of the Interior, I should presume that they must act as
honourable men.</p>
<p>The salaries are not considerable at this theatre. The first performers have
not more than twelve thousand francs a year, exclusively of the <i>feux</i>,
which is the sum given to each of them, when they perform. This, I understand,
does not exceed a louis a night. Those who have a name, indemnify themselves by
going, from time to time, to play in the great commercial towns of the
departments, such as Bordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, &amp;c. where they generally
collect a rich harvest. It is said that VESTRIS has received from the
government a gratification to prevent him from visiting the British metropolis;
and it is also reported that DIDELOT and LABORIE have made vain efforts to
return to the Parisian opera; but that the managers, faithful to their
instructions, refuse to readmit such of the old performers as have voluntarily
quitted it. What attaches performers to the opera-house is the <i>pension de
retraite.</i> They all eventually obtain it, even the chorus-singers.</p>
<p>The remuneration of authors, that is, of the poet and composer of the music,
is to each three hundred francs for every representation, when the piece is not
less than three acts. This is the most common division.
<a name="let42fr4"></a>I know of no operas in one act; those in two are paid in
the above proportion.[<a href="#let42f4">4</a>]</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let42f1">Footnote 1</a>: The refusal made by the Rector
of St. Roch to admit into that church the corpse of Mademoiselle CHAMEROI, has
informed us in England of the loss which this theatre has sustained in that
young and accomplished dancer. She died, generally regretted, in consequence of
being delivered of a child of which VESTRIS considered himself as the real
father. However, M. DE MARKOFF, the Russian ambassador at Paris, stood sponsor
to the infant, and, according to the scandalous chronicle, was not contented
with being only a spiritual father. The Parisian public have consoled
themselves for this loss by talking a great deal about the scene to which it
gave rise. It seems that the Rector was decidedly in the wrong, the dancers of
the opera never having been comprised in the papal excommunication which
involved players. The persons composing the funeral procession were also in the
wrong to go to St. Roch, since the Rector had positively declared that the
corpse of Mademoiselle CHAMEROI should not enter the
church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let42fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let42f2">Footnote 2</a>: In a preceding note, VESTRIS
has been mentioned as the reputed lover of Mademoiselle CHAMEROI, and from this
instance of illicit intercourse, it might, perhaps, be erroneously inferred
that most of the Parisian female opera-dancers had overleaped the pale of
virtue. Without pretending to enter the lists as the champion of their
character, though I admire their talents as warmly as any amateur, truth
induces me to observe that many of these ladies enjoy an unblemished
reputation. Madame VESTRIS, in particular, is universally represented as a
young and pretty woman, much attached to her faithless husband, and,
notwithstanding his improper example, a constant observer of the most exemplary
conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let42fr2">Return to text</a></p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let42f3">Footnote 3</a>: Many years ago, a Parisian
actress, coming on the stage in the part of <i>Mérope</i>, in the tragedy of
that name, her petticoats somehow happened to catch in the side-scene, and, in
her hasty endeavours to disentangle them, she exhibited to the audience the
hind part of her person. In consequence of this accident, a <i>sentence de
police</i> enjoined every woman, whether actress or dancer, not to appear on
the boards of any theatre, without
drawers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let42fr3">Return to text</a></p>

another sprig of laurel to his brow, by the production of a new pantomimical

Every resource of his inexhaustible genius has been employed to give the
happiest effect to this charming work, to enumerate the beauties of which is,
by general report, beyond the powers of language. All the first-rate dancers of
both sexes are placed in the most advantageous point of view throughout this
ballet. Madame GARDEL performs in it the part of Cupid, with all the charms,
wiles, and graces which poets ascribe to the roguish deity. The other
characters are represented in a manner no less interesting. In short, music,
dancing, pantomime, dress, decoration, every thing in this piece, concurs to
stamp it as one of the most wonderful productions of the kind ever exhibited to
the admiration of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let42fr4">Return to

<h2><a name="let43">LETTER XLIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 1, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Fast locked in the arms of Morpheus, and not dreaming of what was to happen,
as Lord North said, when the king caused him to be awakened, in the dead of the
night, to deliver up the seals, so was I roused this morning by a message from
an amiable French lady of my acquaintance, requesting me to send her some
<i>bonbons</i>. "<i>Bonbons</i>!" exclaimed I, "in the name of wonder, Rosalie,
is your mistress so childishly impatient as to send you trailing through the
snow, on purpose to remind me that I promised to replenish her
<i>bonbonnière</i>?"&mdash;"Not exactly so, Monsieur," replied the <i>femme de
chambre</i>, "Madame was willing to be the first to wish you a happy new
year."&mdash;"A new year!" said I, "by the republican calendar, I thought that
the new year began on the 1st of Vendémiaire."&mdash;"Very true," answered she;
"but, in spite of new laws, people adhere to old customs; wherefore we
celebrate the first of January."&mdash;"As to celebrating the first of January,
<i>à la bonne heure</i>, Rosalie," rejoined I, "I have no sort of objection;
but I wish you had adhered to some of your other old customs, and, above all,
to your old hours. I was not in bed till past six o'clock this morning, and
now, you wake me at eight with your congratulations."&mdash;"Never mind,
Monsieur," said she, "you will soon drop asleep again; but my mistress hopes
that you will not fail to make one of her party on the <i>Fête des
Rois</i>."&mdash;"Good heaven!" exclaimed I again, "what, is a
counterrevolution at hand, that the <i>Fête des Rois</i> must also be
celebrated?"&mdash;"'Tis," interrupted Rosalie, "only for the pleasure of
drawing for king and queen."&mdash;"Tell Madame," added I, "that I will accept
her invitation."&mdash;Dismissing the <i>soubrette</i> with this assurance, at
the same time not forgetting to present her with a new year's gift, she at once
revealed the secret of her early visit, by hinting to me that, among intimate
friends, it was customary to give <i>étrennes</i>. This, in plain English,
implies nothing more nor less than that I must likewise make her mistress a
present, on the principle, I suppose, that <i>les petits cadeaux entretiennent
l'amitié</i>.</p>
<p>My reflection then turned on the instability of this people. After
establishing a new division of time, they return to the old one, and celebrate,
as formerly, the first of January. Now, it is evident that the former accords
better with the order of nature, and that autumn was the first season which
followed the creation. Why else should apples of irresistible ripeness and
beauty have presented themselves to the eye of our first parents in the garden
of Eden? This would not have been the case, had the world commenced in
winter.</p>
<p>Besides, a multitude of advantages would accrue to the French from an
adherence to the 1st of Vendémiaire, or 23d of September of the Gregorian
calendar, as the first day of the year. The weather, after the autumnal
equinox, is generally settled, in consequence of the air having been purified
by the pre-existing gales, the ordinary forerunners of that period: and the
Parisians would not be obliged to brave the rain, the wind, the cold, the
frost, the snow, &amp;c. in going to wish a happy new year to their fathers,
mothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, and other relations. For to all this are they
now exposed, unless they choose to ruin themselves in coach-hire. The
consequence is that they are wet, cold, and dirty for two or three successive
days, and are sure to suffer by a sore throat, rheumatism, or fever, all which
entail the expensive attendance of the faculty; whereas, did they celebrate the
23d of September as new year's day, they might, in a quiet, unassuming manner,
pay all their visits on foot, and, in that season, this exercise would neither
be prejudicial to their purse nor their health.</p>
<p>I do not immediately recollect whether I have spoken to you of the
long-expected account of the French expedition to Egypt, by DENON: yet I ought
not to have omitted to inform you that, upwards of two months ago, I set down
your name for a copy of this splendid work. It will cost you 360 francs; but
you will have one of the proof impressions. I have seen a specimen of the
letter-press, which is to consist of a folio volume, printed by Didot. The
plates, amounting to upwards of one hundred and forty in number, are entirely
engraved from DENON'S original drawings, without any reduction or enlargement,
with the exception of that representing the Battle of the Pyramids, the size of
which has been increased at the express desire of BONAPARTE. I have often
amused myself on a morning in contemplating these drawings; but the crowd of
curious persons being generally great, I determined to seize the opportunity of
examining them more at leisure to-day, when the French are entirely engaged in
interchanging the compliments of the season. I found DENON himself diligently
employed on some of the engravings; and so anxious is he for the publication of
the work, that he toils early and late to forward its appearance.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the anxiety he feels on that account, this estimable artist
takes a real pleasure in explaining the subject of his drawings; and, by means
of his obliging communications, I am now become tolerably well acquainted with
Egypt. What country, in fact, has a better claim to fix attention than that
which served as a cradle to human knowledge, and the history of which goes back
to the first ages of the world; a country, where every thing seems to have
commenced? Laws, arts, sciences, and even fables, which derive their origin
from nature, whose attributes they immortalize, and which, at a subsequent
period, formed the ground-work of the ingenious fictions of mythology.</p>
<p>What idea must we not conceive of the industry and civilization of a people
who erected those celebrated monuments, anterior to the annals of history, to
the accounts even of tradition, those pyramids which have unalterably withstood
all the ravages of time?</p>
<p>When we look back on the ancients, the Greeks and Romans almost exclusively
divide our attention. The former, it is true, carried farther the love and the
culture of the fine arts; while the latter are more remarkable for the great
traits of their character; though both acquired that renown which mankind have
so improperly attached to the success of arms.</p>
<p>But, in allowing to Greece all the interest which she claims, in so many
respects, we cannot forget that she was originally peopled by Egyptian
colonies; that it was Egyptians who, in later times, carried thither the
knowledge of the arts, the most necessary and the most indispensable to
society; and that, at the epoch which preceded the splendid days of Greece, it
was also into Egypt that the sages went to acquire that knowledge of a superior
kind, which constituted their glory, and rendered their country
illustrious.</p>
<p>What keeps up a sort of rivalship between Greece and Egypt is that,
independently of the priority of knowledge, the former had the eminent
advantage of opening her arms to philosophy and the sciences, which, forsaking
their adoptive country, and not being able to survive the loss of liberty, fled
back to their natal soil, and found, in the Museum of Alexandria, an asylum,
which neither the Lyceum, the Portico, nor the Academy, could longer afford
them at Athens. Thus, to the reign of the Ptolemies are we, unquestionably,
indebted for the preservation of the knowledge acquired by the ancients.</p>
<p>Apropos, I forgot to mention to you that BERTHOLET, a Senator and Member of
the Institute, communicated to that society, in one of its sittings last month,
a letter from FOURIER, the geometrician, and member of the late Institute of
Egypt. This <i>savant</i>, in the researches he made in Upper Egypt, discovered
and delineated several zodiacs, which, he says, fully confirm the theory of
DUPUIS, respecting the origin and antiquity of the figures of the zodiac. As
far back as the year 1781, DUPUIS published a memoir, since reprinted in his
large work, entitled <i>De l'Origine des Cultes</i>, in which he presumes that
the zodiac, such as it has been transmitted to us by the Greeks, is of Egyptian
origin, and that it goes back to fifteen thousand years, at least, before the
era of the French revolution.</p>
<h2><a name="let44">LETTER XLIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 3, 1802.</i></p>
<p>An almost uninterrupted succession of wet weather has, of late, precluded me
from the regular enjoyment of a morning walk. But, with the new year, we had a
heavy fall of snow, which has since been succeeded by a severe frost. I gladly
availed myself of this opportunity of taking exercise, and yesterday, after
viewing the skaiters in that part of the <i>Champs Elysées</i> which had been
inundated, and is now frozen, I immediately proceeded to the</p>
<p class="center">HÔTEL DES INVALIDES.</p>
<p>This majestic edifice was projected by Henry IV, and executed, by order of
Lewis XIV, after the designs of BRUANT, who laid the foundation on the 30th of
November, 1671. It is composed of five courts, surrounded by buildings. The
middle court is as large as all the other four.</p>
<p>A spacious esplanade planted with trees, an outer court surrounded by a wall
newly-built, form the view towards the river, and lead to the principal façade,
which is twelve hundred feet in extent. This façade has, within these few
years, been entirely polished anew: the details of sculpture have, perhaps,
gained by the operation; but the architecture has certainly lost that gloomy
tint which gave to this building a manly and respectable character. In the
middle of this façade, in the arched part above the great gate, was a
bas-relief of Lewis XIV on horseback.</p>
<p>This gate leads to the great court, which is decorated by two rows of
arcades, the one above the other, forming, on the two stories, uniform
galleries which give light to the apartments of the circumference. The windows,
which serve to light the upper apartments of the façade, are remarkable from
their being placed in cuirasses, as those of the great court are in trophies of
arms.</p>
<p>From this court, you enter the church, now called the <i>Temple of Mars</i>.
It is ornamented with the Corinthian order, and has the form of a Greek cross.
The pulpit no longer exists. The altar, which was magnificently decorated, is
likewise destroyed.</p>
<p>The chapels, to the number of six, were each ornamented by a cupola painted
in fresco, and statues in marble by the greatest masters, which, after being
left for some time exposed to the injuries of the air in the court looking
towards the country, are at length deposited in the MUSEUM OF FRENCH
MONUMENTS.</p>
<p>To the arches of this temple are suspended the standards and colours taken
from the enemy. Two British flags only contribute to augment the number. The
oldest of these trophies have been removed from <i>Notre-Dame</i>. When they
were formerly displayed in that cathedral, a general, who was constantly
victorious, was called by the people the <i>upholsterer of Notre-Dame</i>; an
energetic appellation which spoke home to the feelings. But, however calculated
these emblems of victory may be to foster heroism in the mind of youth, and
rekindle valour in the heart of old age, what a subject of reflection do they
not afford to the philanthropist! How can he, in fact, contemplate these
different flags, without regretting the torrents of blood which they have cost
his fellow-creatures?</p>
<p>In this <i>Temple of Mars</i> is erected the monument of TURENNE, whose
body, after various removals, was conveyed hither, in great pomp, on the 1st of
Vendémiaire, year IX (23d of September, 1800) conformably to a decree of the
Consuls, and immediately deposited in the inside of this tomb.</p>
<p>The present government of France seems to have taken the hint from St. Foix,
who expresses his astonishment that Lewis XIV never conceived the idea of
erecting, in the <i>Hôtel des Invalides</i>, mausolea, with the statues of the
generals who had led with the greatest glory the armies of the nation.
<a name="let44fr1"></a>"Where could they be more honourably interred," says he,
"than amidst those old soldiers, the companions of their fatigues, who, like
themselves, had lavished their blood for their
country?"[<a href="#let44f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>At the age of sixty-four, TURENNE was killed by a cannon-ball, while
reconnoitring the enemy's batteries near the village of Salzbach in Germany, on
the 27th of July, 1675. No less esteemed for his virtues as a man, than
honoured for his talents as a general, he at last fell a victim to his courage.
His soldiers looked up to him as to a father, and in his life-time always gave
him that title. <a name="let44fr2"></a>After his death, when they saw the
embarrassment in which it left the generals who succeeded him in the command of
the army: "<i>Let loose old Piebald</i>," said they, "<i>he will guide
us</i>."[<a href="#let44f2">2</a>] The same ball which (to borrow a line from
Pope) laid</p>
<p class="bq">"The <i>god-like</i> TURENNE prostrate in the dust,"</p>
<p>likewise took off the arm of ST. HILAIRE, Lieutenant-general of artillery:
his son, who was beside him at the moment, uttered a cry of grief. "<i>'Tis not
me, my son, that you must bewail</i>," said ST. HILAIRE; "<i>'tis that great
man.</i>"</p>
<p>The Marshal was as much lamented by the enemy as he was by his own
countrymen; and MONTECUCULLI, the general opposed to him, when he learned the
loss which France had sustained in the person of TURENNE, exclaimed: "Then a
man is dead who was an honour to human nature!"</p>
<p>The Germans, for several years, left untilled the field where he was killed;
and the inhabitants shewed it as a sacred spot. They respected the old tree
under which, he reposed a little time before his death, and would not suffer it
to be cut down. The tree perished only, because soldiers of all nations carried
away pieces of it out of respect to his memory.</p>
<p>TURENNE had been interred in the abbey of St. Denis, and at the time of the
royal vaults being opened in 1793, by order of the National Convention, the
remains of that great captain were respected amid the general destruction which
ensued. From the eagerness of the workmen to behold them, his tomb was the very
first that was opened. When the lid of the coffin was removed, the Marshal was
found in such a state of preservation that he was not at all disfigured: the
features of his face, far from being changed, were perfectly conformable to the
portraits and medallions of TURENNE in our possession.</p>
<p>This monument, now placed in the <i>Temple of Mars</i>, had been erected to
that warrior in the abbey of St. Denis, and was preserved through the care of
M. LENOIR; after being seen for five years in the MUSEUM OF FRENCH MONUMENTS,
of which he is the director, it was removed hither by the before-mentioned
decree of the Consuls. LE BRUN furnished the designs from which it was
executed. The group, composed of TURENNE in the arms of Immortality, is by
TUBY; the accessory figures, the one representing Wisdom, and the other,
Valour, are by MARSY. The bas-relief in bronze in the middle of the cenotaph is
likewise by TURY, and represents TURENNE charging the enemy at the battle of
Turckheim, in 1675.</p>
<p>The dome forms a second church behind the large one, to which it
communicates. Its exterior, entirely covered with lead, is surrounded by forty
pillars of the Composite order, and ornamented with twelve large gilt coats of
mail, crowned with helmets, which serve as skylights, and with a small lantern
with pillars which support a pyramid, surmounted by a large ball and a
cross.</p>
<p>All the architecture of the dome, which is called the new church, is from
the design of MANSARD. Its elevation, from the ground-floor, is three hundred
feet; and its diameter, fifty. It has the character of elegance. The beauty of
its proportion, its decoration, and especially all the parts which concur in
forming the pyramid, render it a master-piece of architecture. But nothing
commands admiration like the interior, though it may be said to be
three-fourths damaged. The twelve windows, by which it is lighted, but which
the observer below cannot perceive, are ornamented with coupled piasters,
resting on a continued pedestal. On the broad band, which was formerly adorned
with flower-de-luces, and at this day with emblems of liberty, were the
medallions of twelve of the most famous kings of France: namely, Clovis,
Dagobert, Childebert, Charlemagne, Lewis the Debonair, Charles the Bald, Philip
Augustus, St. Lewis, Lewis XII, Henry IV, Lewis XIII, and Lewis XIV. The first
arch, distributed into twelve equal parts, presented the twelve apostles,
painted in fresco by JOUVENET. The second arch, painted by LA FOSSE,
represented the apotheosis of St. Lewis, offering to God his sword and crown.
The pavement, which alone has not suffered, is in compartments of different
marbles of great value.</p>
<p>The portal, which looks towards the country, is thirty toises in extent. Of
all the figures which decorated this façade, those of the Four Virtues; namely,
Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence, are the only ones that have been
suffered to remain in their places. They are by COYZEVOX.</p>
<p>The other objects most worthy of notice in this spacious, building, which,
together with its precincts, occupies seventeen <i>arpens</i>, are the
refectories and kitchens, which are very extensive. Formerly, neither of these
were kept in such high order as they are at present. The tables of the private
soldiers are now better supplied; sirloins of beef and legs of mutton being no
longer roasted for the officers only. In the four refectories, where the
soldiers dine, twelve in a mess, they are regularly served with soup, bouilli,
a plate of vegetables, and a pint of unadulterated wine. When Peter the Great
visited this establishment, the Invalids happened to be at dinner, the czar, on
entering the first refectory, poured out a bumper of wine, and drank it off in
a military style to the health of the veterans, whom he termed his
comrades.</p>
<p>The halls are ornamented with paintings representing the conquests of Lewis
XIV. During the reign of terror the features of the <i>Grand Monarque</i>, who
made a conspicuous figure in these pictures, were concealed by a coat of dark
paint, which answered the purpose of a mask. BONAPARTE has ordered this mask to
be removed, so that the ambitious monarch now reappears in all his former
glory.</p>
<p>Whatever may be said in praise of establishments of this description, for my
part, I see nothing in them but the gratification of national pride. The old
soldiers, are, in a manner, without a comrade, though living in the midst of
their brother warriors. The good fellowship which they have witnessed in camps
no longer subsists. The danger of battles, the weight of fatigues, and the
participation of privations and hardships, no longer form the tie of common
interest, by which they were once united. This, being dissolved, they seek in
vain that reciprocity of little kindnesses which they used to find in their own
regiments and armies. All hope of promotion or change being at an end, their
only consolation is to enjoy the present by indulging in reveries concerning
the past.</p>
<p>Instead of being doomed to end their days in this sort of stately
confinement, subject to restrictions which render life so dull and monotonous,
how different would these veterans feel, could they retire to the bosom of
their families and friends! Then, indeed, would they dwell with delight on the
battles and sieges in which they had served, enumerating their many
hair-breadth escapes, and detailing the particulars of the fight in which they
lost their deficient leg or arm. After a pause, the sense of their country's
gratitude operating powerfully on their mind, would soothe every painful
recollection. Their auditors, impressed with admiration, would listen in
silence to the recital of the well-fought day, and, roused by the call of
national honour, cheerfully step forth to emulate these mutilated heroes,
provided they were sure of a <i>free</i> asylum, when reduced to their helpless
condition.</p>
<p>Whether I enter the <i>Hôtel des Invalides</i>, or <i>Chelsea Hospital</i>,
such are the reflections which never fail to occur to me, when I visit either
of those establishments, and contemplate the dejected countenances of the
maimed beings that inhabit them.</p>
<p>Experience tells us that men dislike enjoyments, regularly prepared for
them, if under restraint, and prefer smaller gratifications, of which they can
partake without control. Policy, as well as prudence, therefore dictates a
departure from the present system of providing for those maimed in fighting the
battles of their nation.</p>
<p>In a word, I am fully persuaded that the sums expended in the purchase of
the ground and construction of this magnificent edifice, together with the
charges of maintaining the establishment, would have formed a fund that might
have enabled the government to allow every wounded soldier a competent pension
for life, in proportion to the length of his services, and the injuries which
he might have suffered in defence of his country.</p>
<p>From the <i>Hôtel des Invalides</i> are avenues, planted with trees, which,
on one side, communicate to the <i>New Boulevards</i>, and, on the other, to
the</p>
<p class="center">CHAMP DE MARS.</p>
<p>This extensive inclosure was originally intended for the exercises of the
<i>École Militaire</i>, in front of which it is situated, as you will perceive
by referring to the Plan of Paris. Its form is a parallelogram of four hundred
and fifty toises in length by one hundred and fifty in breadth. It is
surrounded by ditches, faced with masonry, which are bordered on each side by a
double row of trees, extending from the façade of the <i>ci-devant École
Militaire</i> to the banks of the Seine. That building, I shall observe <i>en
passant</i>, was founded in 1751, by Lewis XV, for the military education of
five hundred young gentlemen, destitute of fortune, whose fathers had died in
the service. It stands on the south side of the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, and
serves at present as barracks for the horse-grenadiers of the consular guard.
On the third story of one of the wings is a national observatory, which was
constructed at the instigation of Lalande, the celebrated astronomer.</p>
<p>The various scenes of which the <i>Champ de Mars</i> has successively been
the theatre, are too interesting to be passed over in silence. Indeed, they
exhibit the character of the nation in such striking colours, that to omit
them, would be like omitting some of the principal features in the drawing of a
portrait. Often have they been mentioned, it is true; but subsequent events
have so weakened the remembrance of them, that they now present themselves to
the mind more like dreams than realities. However, I shall touch on the most
remarkable only.</p>
<p>In 1790, a spacious arena, encompassed by a mound of earth, divided into
seats so as to accommodate three hundred thousand spectators, was formed within
this inclosure. To complete it speedily for the ceremony of the first
federation, required immense labour. The slow progress of twenty-five thousand
hired workmen could not keep pace with the ardent wishes of the friends of
liberty. But those were the days of enthusiasm: concord and harmony then
subsisted among the great majority of the French people. What other sentiments,
in fact, could daily bring together, in the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, two hundred
and fifty thousand persons of every class, without distinction of age or sex,
to work at the necessary excavation? Thus, at the end of a week, the
amphitheatre was completed as if by enchantment.</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, since the time of the Spartans, was seen among any people
such an example of cordial union. It would be difficult for the warmest
imagination to conceive a picture so varied, so original, so animated. Every
corporation, every society was ambitious of the honour of assisting in the
erection of the altar of the country: all wished to contribute, by individual
labour, to the arrangement of the place where they were to swear to defend the
constitution. Not a man, woman, or child remained an idle spectator. On this
occasion, the aged seemed to have recovered the vigour of youth, and women and
children to have acquired the strength of manhood. In a word, men of all trades
and professions were confounded, and cheerfully handled the pickaxe and shovel:
delicate females, sprucely dressed, were seen here and there wheeling along
barrows filled with earth; while long strings of stout fellows dragged heavy
loads in carts and waggons. As the electric matter runs along the several links
of an extensive chain, so patriotism seemed to have electrified this whole mass
of people. The shock was universal, and every heart vibrated in unison.</p>
<p>The general good order which prevailed among this vast assemblage, composed
indiscriminately of persons of every rank and condition, was truly surprising.
No sort of improper discourse, no dispute of any kind occurred. But what is
still more singular and more worthy of remark is, that the mutual confidence
shewn by so many people, strangers to each other, was in no one instance
abused. Those who threw off their coats and waistcoats, leaving them to the
fate of chance, during the time they were at work elsewhere, on their return to
the same spot found them untouched. Hence, as Paris is known to abound with
<i>filoux</i>, it may be inferred that the <i>amor patriæ</i> had deadened in
them the impulse of their ordinary vocation.</p>
<p>Franklin, when promoting the emancipation of America, during his residence
in Paris, probably did not foresee that the French would soon borrow his
favourite expression, and that it would become the burden of a popular air. Yet
so it happened; and even Lewis XVI himself participated in the patriotic
labours of the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, while different bands of military music
made the whole inclosure resound with <i>ça ira</i>.</p>
<p>To these exhilarating scenes succeeded others of the most opposite nature.
Hither the guillotine was transported for the execution of the greatest
astronomer of the age, and this with no other view than to prolong his
punishment. Bailly, as every one knows, was the first mayor of Paris after the
revolution. Launched into the vortex of politics, he became involved in the
proscriptions which ensued during the reign of terror, and was dragged from
prison to the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, where, though exposed to the most trying
insults, he died, like a philosopher, with Socratic calmness.</p>
<p>In no one of the numerous victims of the revolution was the instability of
popular favour more fully exemplified than in Bailly. In this <i>Champ de
Mars</i>, where he had published martial law in consequence of a decree of the
Convention, in the very place where he had been directed by the representatives
of the people to repel the factions, he expired under the guillotine, loaded
with the execration of that same people of whom he had been the most venerated
idol.</p>
<p>Since those sanguinary times, the <i>Champ de Mars</i> has chiefly been the
site chosen for the celebration of national fêtes, which, within these few
years, have assumed a character more distinguished than any ever seen under the
old <i>régime</i>. These modern Olympics consist of chariot-races and
wrestling, horse and foot races, ascensions of balloons, carrying three or four
persons, descents from them by means of a parachute, mock-fights and aquatic
tilting. After the sports of the day, come splendid illuminations, grand
fire-works, pantomimes represented by two or three hundred performers, and
concerts, which, aided by splendid decorations, are not deficient in point of
effect: the evening concludes with dancing.</p>
<p>During the existence of the directorial government, the number of national
fêtes had been considerably increased by the celebration of party triumphs.
They are at present reduced to the two great epochs of the revolution, the
taking of the Bastille on the 14th of July, 1789, and the foundation of the
Republic on the 23d of September, 1792. On the anniversary of those days, the
variety of the exhibitions always attracted an immense concourse. The whole of
this mound, whose greatest diameter is upwards of eight hundred yards, was then
covered with spectators; but were the <i>Champ de Mars</i> now used on such
occasions, they would be compelled to stand, there being no longer any seats
for their accommodation.</p>
<p>The subject of national fêtes has, in this country, employed many pens, and
excited much discussion. Some say that they might be rendered more interesting
from the general arrangement; while others affirm that they might be made to
harmonize more with the affections and habits of the people. In truth, this
modern imitation of the Greek festivals has fallen far short of those
animating, mirth-inspiring scenes, so ably described by the learned author of
Anacharsis, where, to use his own words, "every heart, eagerly bent on
pleasure, endeavoured to expand itself in a thousand different ways, and
communicated to others the impression which rendered it happy." Whatever
exertions have hitherto been made to augment the splendour of these days of
festivity, it seems not to admit of a doubt that they are still susceptible of
great improvement. If the French have not the wine of <i>Naxos</i>, their
goblets may at least sparkle with <i>vin de Surenne</i>; the <i>Champs
Elysées</i> may supply the place of the shady bowers of <i>Delos</i>; and, in
lieu of the name of the ill-fated NICIAS, the first promoter of the sports
formerly celebrated in that once-happy island, the air may be made to ring with
the name of the more fortunate BONAPARTE.</p>

<h2><a name="let45">LETTER XLV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 6, 1802.</i></p>
<p>In speaking of the interior of the <i>Louvre</i>, in one of my former
letters, I think I mentioned the various learned and scientific societies,
which, under the name of Academies, formerly held their sittings in that
palace. For the sake of facilitating a comparison between the past and the
present, it may be necessary to state the professed object of those different
institutions.</p>
<p><i>French Academy</i>. The preservation of the purity of the French
language, its embellishment and augmentation.</p>
<p><i>Academy of Sciences</i>. The progress of the sciences, the encouragement
of researches and discoveries, as well in physics, geometry, and astronomy, as
in those sciences which are applicable to the daily wants of society.</p>
<p><i>Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres</i>. The composition of
inscriptions, of the subjects of medals, and their mottos, the research of the
manners, habits, customs, and monuments of antiquity, as well as all literature
relating to history.</p>
<p><i>Academy of Painting and Sculpture.</i><br />
<i>Academy of Architecture.</i><br />
The titles of these are a sufficient explanation.</p>
<p>All these academies were founded by Lewis XIV, at the instigation of his
minister Colbert; with the exception of the French Academy, which owed its
origin to Cardinal Richelieu. This was a misfortune for that society; for
custom had established it as a law that every new member, on the day of his
reception, should not only pronounce a panegyric on him whom he succeeded, but
also on the founder of the institution. It certainly was not very philosophical
for men of enlightened understanding, and possessing even a common portion of
sensibility, to make an eulogium on a minister so cruel, a man of a spirit so
diabolically vindictive, that he even punished the innocent to revenge himself
on the guilty. De&nbsp;Thou, the celebrated author of the <i>History of his own
time</i>, had told some truths not very favourable to the memory of the
Cardinal's great uncle. In consequence, the implacable minister, under false
pretences, caused the philosophic historian's eldest son to be condemned and
decapitated, saying: "De&nbsp;Thou, the father, has put my name into his
history, I will put the son into mine."</p>
<p>It is well known, from their memoirs, that these academies included among
their members men of eminent talents. The Academy of Sciences, in particular,
could boast of several first-rate geniuses in the different branches which they
respectively cultivated, and the unremitting labours of some of them have, no
doubt, greatly contributed to enlarge the sphere of human knowledge.
<a name="let45fr1"></a>During the early part of the revolution, all these
monarchical institutions were overthrown, and on their ruins rose the</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND
SCIENCES.[<a href="#let45f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>This establishment was formed, agreeably to a decree of the National
Assembly passed on the 3d of Brumaire, year IV (25th of October, 1796). By that
decree, it appears that the Institute belongs to the whole Republic, though its
point of union is fixed in Paris. Its object is to extend the limits of the
arts and sciences in general, by an uninterrupted series of researches, by the
publication of discoveries, by a correspondence with the learned societies of
foreign countries, and by such scientific and literary labours as tend to
general utility and the glory of the Republic.</p>
<p>It is composed of one hundred and forty-four members, resident in Paris, and
of an equal number scattered over the departments. The number of its foreign
associates is twenty-four. It is divided into three classes, and each class
into several sections, namely:</p>
<p>Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br />
Moral and Political Sciences.<br />
Literature and the Fine Arts.<br />
The Mathematical Class is divided into ten sections; each of which consists of
six members. Of this class, there are sixty members in Paris, and as many in
the departments, where they are divided, in the same manner, into ten sections,
each of six members.</p>
<p>The first section comprehends Mathematics.<br />
The second, Mechanical Arts.<br />
The third, Astronomy.<br />
The fourth, Experimental Physics.<br />
The fifth, Chemistry.<br />
The sixth, Natural History and Mineralogy.<br />
The seventh, Botany and vegetable Physics.<br />
The eighth, Anatomy and Zoology.<br />
The ninth, Medicine and Surgery.<br />
The tenth, Rural Economy and the Veterinary Art.</p>
<p>The Moral and Political Class is divided into six sections, each consisting
of six members, making in all thirty-six members in Paris, and an equal number
in the departments.</p>
<p>The first section comprises the Analysis of Sensations and Ideas.<br />
The second, Morals.<br />
The third, Social Science and Legislation.<br />
The fourth, Political Economy.<br />
The fifth, History.<br />
The sixth, Geography.<br />
<p>The Class of Literature and Fine Arts is divided into eight sections, each
of six members, forty-eight of whom reside in Paris, and as many in the
departments.</p>
<p>The first section includes Grammar.<br />
The second, Ancient Languages.<br />
The third, Poetry.<br />
The fourth, Antiquities and Monuments.<br />
The fifth, Painting.<br />
The sixth, Sculpture.<br />
The seventh, Architecture.<br />
The eighth, Music and Declamation.<br />
<p>Twice in every decade, each class holds a meeting: that of the first class
takes place on the first and sixth days; that of the second, on the second and
seventh days; and that of the third, on the third and eighth days. Every six
months each class elects its president and two secretaries, who continue in
office during that interval.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the first decade of every month is held a general
meeting of the three classes, the purpose of which is to deliberate on affairs,
relating to the general interests of the Institute. The chair is then taken by
the oldest of the three presidents, who, at these meetings, presides over the
whole society.</p>
<p>The National Institute has four public quarterly meetings, on the 15th of
the months of Vendémiaire, Nivôse, Germinal, and Messidor. Each class annually
proposes two prize questions, and in the general meetings, the answers are made
public, and the premiums distributed. The united sections of Painting,
Sculpture, and Architecture nominate the pupils who are to visit Rome, and
reside there in the national palace, at the expense of the Republic, in order
to study the Fine Arts. Conformably to the decree by which the Institute was
organised, six of its members were to travel at the public charge, with a view
of collecting information, and acquiring experience in the different sciences;
and twenty young men too were to visit foreign countries for the purpose of
studying rural economy: but the expenses of the war and other matters have
occasioned such a scarcity of money as, hitherto, to impede these
undertakings.</p>
<p>The apartments of the Institute are on the first floor of the <i>Louvre</i>,
or, as it is now styled, the <i>Palais Nationial des Sciences et des Arts</i>.
These apartments, which were once inhabited by Henry IV, are situated on the
west side of that building. Before you arrive at the hall of the Institute, you
pass through a handsome antichamber, in which are the statues of Molière,
Racine, Corneille, La Fontaine, and Montesquieu. This hall, which is oblong and
spacious, formerly served for the meetings of the Academy of Sciences. Its
sides are adorned with colonnades, and the ceiling is richly painted and
decorated. In the intercolumniations are fourteen marble statues (seven on each
side) of some of the most celebrated men that France has produced: namely,
Condé, Tourville, Descartes, Bayard, Sully, Turenne, Daguessau, Luxembourg,
L'Hôpital, Bossuet, Duquesne, Catinat, Vauban, and Fenelon. Parallel to the
walls, tables are set, covered with green cloth, at which the members take
their places.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the hall is the chair of the President, and on each side
below him are seated the two Secretaries. A little on one side again is the
tribune, from which the members who speak address the assembly, after having
asked leave of the President, who never quits the chair during the whole
meeting. The space appropriated to the members is inclosed by a railing,
between which and the walls, the hall is surrounded by benches for the
spectators, among whom there are generally many of the fair sex.</p>
<p>The library of the Institute consists of three spacious apartments, which
are said to contain about sixteen thousand volumes. On one side of the hall is
an apartment, destined for the communications of correspondents. There is also
an apartment for the secretary and his deputies, and a large room containing a
collection of machines and models, (among which are several of shipping), as
well as every apparatus necessary for chemical and physical experiments.</p>
<p>Although I have several times attended the private meetings of the three
classes, I have thought that the printed accounts of their proceedings, which I
subjoin, would be more satisfactory than a hasty sketch from my pen. However,
as I promised to describe to you one of the public sittings of the Institute, I
shall now inform you of what passed at that held yesterday, the 15th of Nivôse,
year X, (5th of January, 1802), at which I was present.</p>
<p>On this occasion, BIGOT-PRÉAMENEU, one of the members of the class of Moral
and Political Sciences, was the President. The sitting was opened by
proclaiming the nomination of three foreign associates, elected by the
Institute in its general sitting of the 5th of Nivôse; namely, Mr. JEFFERSON,
Sir JOSEPH BANKS, and HAYDN, the celebrated musical composer. A prize was then
awarded to Citizen Framery, a literary character residing in Paris, for having
solved the following question proposed by the class of Literature and Fine
Arts. "To analyze the relations existing between music and declamation, and
determine the means of applying declamation to music, without detracting from
the charms of melody."</p>
<p>DELAMBRE read an account of the life and works of Cousin.</p>
<p>DÉGÉRANDO, an account of the education which the young savage of Aveyron
receives from Itard, physician to the Institution of the Deaf and Dumb.</p>
<p>PRONY, the result of observations made with a French instrument and an
English one, for the purpose of determining the relation between the French
metre and the English foot.</p>
<p>Next were heard notes, by CAMUS, on the public exhibitions of the
productions of French Industry, which took place in the years VI and IX of the
Republic.</p>
<p>Then, the report of the restoration of the famous picture known by the name
of the <i>Madonna di Foligno</i>, which I have already communicated to you.</p>
<p>BUACHE, the celebrated geographer, read some observations on the ancient map
of the Romans, commonly called Peutinger's map, as well as on the geography of
the anonymous writer of Ravenna. The sitting was terminated by an account of
the life and works of Dumoustier, read by COLIN D'HARLEVILLE.</p>
<p>The members of the Institute have a full-dress and a half-dress. The former
consists of a suit of black, embroidered in dark green silk, with a cocked hat.
The latter is the same, but the embroidery is confined to the collar and cuffs
of the coat, which is trimmed with a cord edging,</p>
<p>P.S. Yesterday evening was married Mademoiselle Beauharnois, daughter-in-law
of the First Consul, to Louis Bonaparte, one of his younger brothers.</p>

<h2><a name="let46">LETTER XLVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 7, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Knowing you to be an amateur of Italian music, I am persuaded that you will
wish to be made acquainted with the theatre where you may enjoy it in full
perfection. It is distinguished by the appellation of</p>
<p class="center">OPÉRA BUFFA.</p>
<p>This establishment is not new in the French metropolis. In 1788, Paris was
in possession of an excellent company of Italian comedians, who then performed
in the <i>Théâtre de Monsieur</i>, in the palace of the <i>Tuileries</i>, which
is now converted into a hall for the sittings of the Council of State. The
success of this company had a rapid influence on the taste of the discerning
part of the French public. This was the less extraordinary as, perhaps, no
Italian sovereign had ever assembled one composed of so many capital
performers. In Italy, there are seldom more than two of that degree of merit in
a company; the rest are not attended to, because they are not worth the
trouble: but here every department was complete, and filled by persons
deservedly enjoying a high reputation in their own country; such as MANDINI,
RAFFANELLI, SIMONI, MENGOZZI, VIGANONI, ROVEDINO, and Signoras MORICHELLI and
BALETTI.</p>
<p>The events of 1792 banished from Paris this admired assemblage. A new
company of Italian comedians has been formed here within these few months: they
at first occupied a charming little theatre constructed for the use of a
society, called <i>La Loge Olympique</i>; but are lately removed to the
<i>Théâtre Favart</i>, on the Boulevard. Before the revolution, this was called
<i>le Théâtre Italien</i>. The façade is decorated with eight very large Ionic
pillars. The house is of an oval form, and the interior distribution deserving
of praise, in as much as it is far more commodious than that of any other
theatre in Paris. The audience here too is generally of a more select
description. Among the female amateurs, Madame Tallien is one of its most
constant visiters, and, in point of grace and beauty, one of its greatest
ornaments.</p>
<p>At the head of this new company, may be placed RAFFANELLI, the same whom I
have just mentioned. He is a consummate comedian, and more to be commended in
that point of view than as a singer. RAFFANELLI has a countenance to which he
gives any cast he pleases: his features, from their wonderful pliability,
receive every impression: his eye is quick; his delivery, natural and correct;
and his action, easy. Sometimes he carries his buffooneries too far, merely to
excite laughter; but as he never fails in his object, this defect may be
overlooked. His best characters are <i>Taddeo</i> in <i>Il Rè Theodora</i>,
<i>il Governatore</i> in <i>La Molinara</i>, the Father in <i>Furberia e
Puntiglio</i>, and the Deaf Man in <i>Il Matrimonio Secreto</i>. It is
necessary to see him in these different operas to form a just idea of the truth
and humour with which he represents them. Although he is but an indifferent
singer, his method is good, and he seizes the spirit of the composer with
perfect discrimination. In <i>morceaux d'ensemble</i>, he is quite at home, and
when he dialogues with the orchestra, he shews much energy and feeling.
Independently of these gifts, Nature has granted to RAFFANELLI another most
valuable privilege. She seems to have exempted him from the impression of time.
In 1788 and 89, I saw him frequently, both on and off the stage; after a lapse
of upwards of twelve years, he appears again to my eyes exactly the same man. I
cannot perceive in him the smallest change.</p>
<p>The tenor of the new company is LAZZARINI. His method too is very good; he
sings with taste, expression, and feeling; but his voice is extremely weak: his
powers appear exhausted; and it is only by dint of painful efforts that he
succeeds in giving to his singing those embellishments which his taste
suggests, but which lose their grace and charm when they are laboured. In
short, LAZZARINI communicates to the audience an unpleasant sensation in
proving that he has real talents.</p>
<p>Neither the same reproaches nor the same praises can be bestowed on
PARLAMAGNI. He is a good counter-tenor, but has a harshness in the high tones,
which he does not always reach with perfect justness. He is also deficient in
ease and grace. PARLAMAGNI, however, having an advantageous person, and the air
of a Frenchman, is a great favourite with the Parisian <i>dilettanti</i>. He is
a tolerably good comedian, and in some scenes of buffoonery, his acting is
natural, and his manner free and unaffected.</p>
<p>The <i>prima donna</i> of the Italian company is Signora STRINA-SACCHI. She
possesses a fine voice, and no small share of taste, joined to great confidence
and a perfect acquaintance with the stage. Sometimes she is rather apt to
fatigue the ear by sounds too shrill, and thus breaks the charm produced by her
singing. As for her acting, it is as extraordinary as can well be imagined; for
her vivacity knows no bounds; and her passion, no restraint. She appears to
conceive justly, to feel very warmly, and she plays in the same manner. In her,
Nature commands every thing; Art, nothing. The parts in which she shines most,
are <i>La Molinara</i> and <i>Gianina</i>; in these, she literally follows the
impulse given her by her situation, without concerning herself in the least,
whether it is <i>secundum artem</i>; but certain that it is natural and
conformable to the character and habits of the personage she represents.
<i>Anima in voce</i> is the characteristic of her singing: the same epithet may
be applied to her recitative and her acting: in these she displays no less
spirit and animation.</p>
<p>After Signora SACCHI, comes Signora PARLAMAGNI. She is a young, and rather
pretty woman, not unlike a French actress in her manner. Her voice is free and
clear, and her method by no means to be disdained. She wants habit and
confidence. This is evident in her performance of a part new to her; for it is
only after a few representations that she feels herself at her ease. Then the
public appreciate her powers, which she exhibits to advantage; and her
exertions are rewarded by reiterated marks of their satisfaction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is the nature of an Italian opera-house to have its shelf
poorly furnished. It cannot, however, be denied that the managers of the
<i>Opera Buffa</i> take every pains to vary and increase their stock. The
following are the pieces which I have seen at this theatre.</p>
<p><i>Furberia e Puntiglio</i>, which is a second-hand imitation of GOLDONI.
The music, by Signor MARCELLO DI CAPUA, is agreeable, particularly a quartetto
and a cavatina. RAFFANELLI shines in this piece as a first-rate actor.</p>
<p><i>Il Matrimonio Secreto</i>, the chef-d'&oelig;uvre of CIMAROSA, and of its
kind, perhaps, the most charming opera extant. Throughout it, the composer has
lavished beauties; there is not to be found in it an air of inferior merit, or
which, of itself alone, would not sustain the reputation of a piece. What then
can be said of a work in which they are all united? Nothing can surpass the
variety, spirit, grace, and originality of the duos, terzettos, quartettos,
&amp;c. with which this opera abounds. CIMAROSA has here combined the strength
of German harmony with the grace which constitutes the charm of Italian melody.
He is particularly famous for the brilliancy of his ideas, the fecundity of his
genius, the richness of his style, and, above all, for the finish of his
pictures.</p>
<p>The certain effect of such a production is to eclipse every thing put in
competition with it. This effect is particularly conspicuous at the
representation of other pieces, the music of which is by the same composer.</p>
<p><i>Gianina e Bernadone</i>, another of CIMAROSA'S productions, makes less
impression, though it is in the graceful style, what <i>Il Matrimonio
Secreto</i> is in the serio-comic.</p>
<p><i>La Molinara</i>, however, upholds the reputation of that celebrated
composer, PAËSIELLO. This opera requires no eulogium. Selections from it are
daily repeated in the public and private concerts in Paris. <i>Il Matrimonio
Secreto</i> is a masterpiece of spirit and originality, while <i>La
Molinara</i> is a model of grace, melody, and simplicity.</p>
<p>To the great regret of the lovers of Italian music, CIMAROSA died not long
since, just as he was preparing to visit Paris. But his fame will long survive,
as his works bear the stamp of true genius, combined with taste and judgment.
His <i>Italiana in Londra</i> is just announced for representation.</p>
<p><i>Il Matrimonio Inaspettato</i>, a composition of PAËSIELLO, is likewise in
rehearsal, as well as <i>Le Nozze di Dorina</i>, by SARTI, and <i>La Vilanella
Rapita</i>, by BIANCHI. MOZART too will soon enter the lists; his <i>Dom
Giovanni</i> is to be speedily brought forward.</p>
<p>The orchestra of the <i>Opéra Buffa</i>, though far from numerous, is
extremely well-composed. It accompanies the singers with an <i>ensemble</i>, a
grace, and precision deserving of the highest encomium. BRUNI, a distinguished
Italian composer, is the leader of the band, and PARENTI, a professor, known
also by several admired productions, presides at the piano-forte.</p>
<p><a name="let46fr1"></a>NEUVILLE, the manager of this theatre, is gone to
Italy for the purpose of completing the company by the addition of some eminent
performers.[<a href="#let46f1">1</a>] In its present state, the <i>Opéra
Buffa</i> maintains its ground. It is thought that the French government will
assist it in case of necessity, and even make it a national establishment; a
commissary or agent having been appointed to superintend its proceedings.</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let46f1">Footnote 1</a>: The <i>Opéra Buffa</i>, the
constant object of the jealousy of the other lyric theatres, because it
constitutes the delight of real amateurs of music, has, during the year 1802,
acquired several new performers. Two of these only, Madame BOLLA and
MARTINELLI, deserve particular mention. Madame BOLLA is a good figure on the
stage, and though her features are not regular, yet they are susceptible of the
most varied expression. Her voice, which is a species of feminine
<i>tenore</i>, astonishes by the purity and firmness of its grave tones; while
her brilliant and sure method easily conceals its small extent in the higher
notes. MARTINELLI is a species of counter-tenor. His voice has already lost
much of its strength, and has not that clearness which serves as an excuse for
every thing; but connoisseurs find that he takes care to calculate its effects
so as to make amends, by the art of transitions, for that firmness in which it
is deficient. He is much applauded in the <i>cantabile</i>, which he sings with
uncommon precision, and he particularly shines in the counter-parts which charm
in the Italian <i>finales</i>. As an actor, MARTINELLI, though inferior to
RAFFANELLI, is also remarkable. His manner is easy and natural, and his
countenance capable of assuming the most comic
expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let46fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let47">LETTER XLVII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 9, 1802.</i></p>
<p>The exaggerated accounts of the interior state of France which have reached
us, through various channels, during the late obstinate struggle, have diffused
so many contradictions, that it is by no means surprising we still continue so
ill-informed in England on many points most intimately connected with the
morals of the French nation. Respecting none of these, have we been more
essentially mistaken than the</p>
<p class="center">PRESENT STATE OF PUBLIC WORSHIP.</p>
<p>I am given to understand, from unquestionable authority, that there are at
this moment, and have been for the last four years, no less than from
thirty-five to forty thousand churches where divine service has been regularly
performed throughout the different departments of the Republic. It is therefore
a gross error to suppose that the christian religion was extinguished in
France. The recent arrangements made between the French government and the See
of Rome will consolidate that religion, which was, in a great measure,
re-established long before his Holiness occupied the papal chair. I shall
illustrate this truth by a summary of the proceedings of the constitutional
clergy.</p>
<p>The last general assembly of the clergy of France, held in 1789, the account
of which has never been printed, already presented facts which announced that
the necessity of reforming abuses was felt, and the epoch when that reform
would take place was foreseen. In this assembly several bishops spoke with much
force on the subject.</p>
<p>The disastrous state of the finances, brought about by the shameful
dilapidations of the court, occasioned a deficit which it was necessary to make
good. This consideration, joined to the spirit of cupidity, jealous of the
estates of the clergy, immediately caused every eye to turn towards that
mortmain property, in order to employ it in the liquidation of the national
debt.</p>
<p>In the <i>Moniteur</i>, and other journals of the time, may be seen what
successive steps gradually led to the abolition of tythes, and the decision
which placed the estates of the clergy at the disposal of the nation.</p>
<p>The civil constitution of the clergy was a severe check given to the many
existing abuses. It really brought back the Gallican church to the discipline
of the first ages. It snatched from the Pope the power of giving the canonical
institution to bishops. Those who have thought proper to tax with novelty this
constitution, have only to look into history. They will see that, during twelve
hundred years, bishops received the canonical institution from the
metropolitans, and not from the Pope. Thus to tax with intrusion the
constitutional bishops, and condemn them because they have received that
institution from the metropolitans, is to condemn the first twelve centuries of
christianity.</p>
<p>This civil constitution served as a pretext to the dignified clergy,
irritated at the loss of their estates, for concerting a combined resistance to
the new laws, in the hope that this resistance would lead to a subversion which
would restore to them their riches. Thence the refusal of the oath "to be
faithful to the nation, to the law, and to the king, to guide faithfully the
flock intrusted to their care, and to maintain with all their power the
constitution decreed by the assembly, and sanctioned by the king." Thence the
line of division between the clergy who had taken the oath and those who had
not.</p>
<p>The Constituent Assembly, who had decreed the above oath, declared, that the
refusal of giving this pledge of fidelity should be considered as a voluntary
resignation. The royal sanction had rendered the above decree a law of the
State. Almost the whole of the bishops, a great number of rectors, and other
ecclesiastics, refused to take this oath, already taken by several among them
who were deputies to the assembly.</p>
<p>They were, in consequence, declared to have resigned; and measures were
taken for supplying their place. The people proceeded to effect this by
electors authorized by law. A respectable number of ecclesiastics, who had
already submitted to the law, accepted the elections. These priests thought
that obedience to the national authority which respected and protected
religion, was a catholic dogma. What resistance could be made to legitimate
power, which neither attacked the dogma, nor morality, nor the interior and
essential discipline of the church? It was, say they, resisting God himself.
They thought that the pastor was chosen, and sent solely for the care of the
flock intrusted to him; that, when difficult circumstances, flight, for
instance, voluntary or forced, the prohibition from all functions, pronounced
by the civil power, rendered the holy ministry impossible, or that the pastor
could not exericise it, without declaring himself in open insurrection, the
pretended unremoveable rights then ceased with the sacred duties which they
could not discharge, without being accused of rebellion.</p>
<p>The dissentient bishops drew many priests into their party. Most of them
spread themselves over Europe, where they calumniated at their ease the
patriotic clergy. Those of their adherents who had remained in the interior of
this country, kindled a civil war, tormented people's consciences, and
disturbed the peace of families, &amp;c. This conduct, which engendered the
horrible scenes in La Vendée, provoked repressive measures, emanated from
legislative authority.</p>
<p>Enemies without and within, say the constitutional clergy, wished to create
a disgust to liberty, by substituting to it licentiousness. And, indeed, the
partisans of the dissentient clergy were seen to coalesce with the unbelievers,
in order to produce the sacrilegious disorders which broke out every where in
the year 1793.</p>
<p>The clergy who had taken the oath had organized the dioceses; the bishops,
in general, had bestowed great pains in spreading in every parish the word of
the gospel; for they preached themselves, and this was more than was done by
their predecessors, who, engaged only in spending, frequently in a shameful
manner, immense revenues, seldom or never visited their dioceses. The
constitutional clergy followed a plan more conformable to the gospel, which
gained them the affection of the well-disposed part of the nation.</p>
<p>These priests were of opinion that the storm which threatened religion,
required imperiously the immediate presence of the pastor, and that, in the day
of battle, it was necessary to be in person at the breach. They were of opinion
that the omission or impossibility of fulfilling minute and empty formalities,
imposed by a Concordat, rejected from the beginning by all the public bodies
and the church of France, and annihilated at the moment by the will of the
representatives of the nation, sanctioned by royal authority, could not exempt
them from accepting holy functions presented by all the constituted
authorities, and on which evidently depended the preservation of religion, the
salvation of the faithful, and the peace of the State.</p>
<p>But, when persecution manifested itself, the clergy who had taken the oath,
became equally the victims of persecuting rage. Some failed in this
conjuncture; but the greater number remained intrepid in their principles.
Accordingly several constitutional bishops and priests were dragged to the
scaffold. If, on the one hand, the dastardly GOBEL was guillotined, the same
fate attended the respectable EXPILLY, bishop of Quimper, AMOURETTE, bishop of
Lyons, and GOUTTES, bishop of Autun, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The dissentient clergy reproach some constitutional priests with having
married, and even with having apostatized; but they say not that, among the
dissentient, there are some who; have done the same. If the number of the
latter is smaller, it is because the greater part of them were out of France;
but what would they have done, if, like the constitutional clergy, they had
either had the axe suspended over their head, or the guillotine accompanying
all their steps?</p>
<p>In England, where the French priests were not thus exposed, there are some
who have likewise married, and even some who have apostatized.</p>
<p>It is well known that, amidst the terrors of impiety, GRÉGOIRE, bishop of
Blois, declared that he braved them, and remained attached to his principles
and duties, as a christian and bishop. He firmly believed that, in doing so, he
was pronouncing his sentence of death, and, for eighteen months, he was in
expectation of ascending the scaffold. The same courage animated the majority
of the constitutional bishops and priests. They exercised secretly their
ministry, and consoled the faithful. As soon as the rage for persecution began
to abate, GRÉGOIRE and some other bishops, who had kept up a private
correspondence with the clergy of various dioceses for the purpose of
encouraging them, concerted together in order to reorganize worship. In Nivôse
year III (January 1795), GRÉGOIRE demanded this liberty of worship of the
National Convention. He was very sure of meeting with outrages, and he
experienced some; but to speak in the tribune, was speaking to France and to
all Europe, and, in the then state of things, he was almost certain of
staggering public opinion, which would force the Convention to grant the free
exercise of religion. Accordingly, some time after having refused the liberty
of worship on the demand of GRÉGOIRE, that assembly granted it, though with
evident reluctance, on a Report of BOISSY D'ANGLAS, which insulted every
species of worship.</p>
<p>The constitutional bishops had already anticipated this moment by their
writings and their pastoral letters, &amp;c. They then compiled two works,
entitled <i>Lettres Encycliques</i>, to which the bishops and priests of the
various dioceses adhered. The object of these works, which are monuments of
wisdom, piety, and courage, was to reorganize public worship in all the
dioceses, according to the principles of the primitive church. They pronounced
a formal exclusion from ecclesiastical functions against all prevaricating
priests or married ones, as well as all those who had the cowardice to deliver
up their authority for preaching, and abdicate their functions. Some interested
persons thought this too severe. Those bishops persisted in their decision,
and, by way of answer, they reprinted a translation of the celebrated treatise
of St. Cyprian de Lapsis. On all sides, they reanimated religions zeal, caused
pastors for the various sees to be elected by the people, and consecrated by
the metropolitan bishops. They held synods, the arts of which form a valuable
collection, equally honourable to their zeal and knowledge. They did more.</p>
<p>For a long time past the custom of holding councils had fallen into disuse.
They convoked a national council, notwithstanding the unfavourableness of a
silent persecution; and, in spite of the penury which afflicted the pastors,
the latter had the courage to expose themselves in order to concur in it. This
council was opened with the greatest solemnity on the 15th of August, 1797, the
day of the Assumption of the Virgin. It sat for three months. The canons and
decrees of this assembly, which have been translated into Italian and German,
have been printed in one volume.</p>
<p>This council was published in the different dioceses, and its regulations
were put into force. During this time, the government, ever hostile to
religion, had not abandoned the project of persecuting and perhaps of
destroying it. The voice of the public, who called for this religion, and held
in esteem the constitutional clergy as religious and patriotic, checked, in
some respects, the hatred of the Directory and its agents. Then the spirit of
persecution took a circuitous way to gain its end: this was to cry down
religion and its ministers, to promote theophilanthropy, and enforce the
transferring of Sunday to the <i>décade</i>, or tenth day of every republican
month.</p>
<p>The bishops, assembled at Paris, again caused this project to miscarry, and,
in their name, GRÉGOIRE compiled two consultations against the transferring of
Sunday to the <i>décade</i>. The adhesion of all the clergy was the fruit of
his labour; but all this drew on him numerous outrages, the indigence to which
he was at that time reduced, and multiplied threats of deportation. The
functions which he had discharged, and the esteem of the friends of religion,
formed around him a shelter of opinion that saved him from deportation, to
which were condemned so many unfortunate and virtuous constitutional priests,
who were crowded, with the refractory among others, into vessels lying in the
road of Rochefort.</p>
<p>GRÉGOIRE remonstrated against this grievance, and obtained an alleviation
for his brethren; but it is to be remarked that, in giving an account of their
enlargement, the dissentient priests have taken good care not to mention to
whom they were indebted for having provoked in their behalf this act of
humanity and justice.</p>
<p>The constitutional clergy continued their labours, struggling incessantly
against calumny and libels, either from their dissentient brethren or from the
agents of the directorial government. This clergy convoked a second national
council for the year 1801. It was preceded by a vast number of synods, and by
eight metropolitan councils.</p>
<p>This second national council was opened at Paris on St. Peter's day of the
same year. Several decrees had already been carried, one of which renewed, in
the face of the whole church, the example of the bishops of Africa, by a solemn
invitation of the dissentients to conferences for the grand affair which
separated them from the constitutional clergy. The different congregations were
on the point of presenting to the general meeting their labours on the dogma,
morality, and discipline. A report on the liturgy by GRÉGOIRE, bishop of Blois
and vice-president of the council; and a similar report on the plan of
education for ecclesiastics, occupied the members of this assembly, when all at
once the government manifested its wish to see the council closed, on account
of the Concordat which it had just arranged with the Pope.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this proceeding, which trenched on the rights of a national
church, the fathers of the council suspended their remonstrances, in order not
to afford any pretext to those who might have wished to perpetuate religious
troubles. Wherefore, after having sat six weeks and pronounced the suspension
of the national council, &amp;c. they separated quietly without quitting
Paris.</p>
<p>Their presence was necessary for the execution of the decree of the
conferences. The eighteen members destined for that purpose by the council,
after having held several meetings, presented themselves at the Cathedral of
<i>Notre-Dame</i>, the place appointed and proclaimed by the council throughout
all the extent of France. For three successive days, morning and evening, they
there assembled. At the expiration of that time, on seeing that the dissentient
kept themselves concealed, the members of the constitutional clergy took for
witnesses of this generous and open proceeding the vast body of people who had
repaired to <i>Notre-Dame</i>, and by two energetic and moving discourses,
delivered by BELMAY, bishop of Carcassonne, and GRÉGOIRE, bishop of Blois,
terminated the council after the accustomed prayers.</p>
<p>M. SPINA, archbishop of Corinth, charged by the court of Rome with part of
the affairs to be transacted with the First Consul, about the middle of
September, sent to the constitutional bishops a brief which he announced to
come from Pius VII, in order to induce them on the part of the Pope to give up
the episcopal sees they had occupied, and return to unity. An invitation so
insulting, received by all these bishops, drew on M. SPINA energetic answers,
which made the Pope and himself sensible how wrong they were to accuse of
intrusion and schism bishops, whose canonical institution was conformable to
that of the bishops of the first twelve centuries, and who had always professed
the warmest love for catholic unity.</p>
<p>But as there was little good to be expected from M. SPINA, some bishops made
their complaints to the government in a spirited and well-composed memorial,
denouncing the Pope's brief as an attack on the liberties of the Gallican
church and the rights of the Republic. This measure had its effect. The
government passed a decree for prohibiting the publication of the Rescripts of
Rome, if they should not be found conformable to the rules and usages observed
in France.</p>
<p>During these transactions, the Cardinal Legate, CAPRARA, arrived in Paris.
The Concordat had just been signed. The constitutional bishops, without
remonstrating against it, no sooner learnt that the government wished them to
resign, than they hastened to do so, the more willingly, as they had a thousand
times made the promise whenever the good of religion and of the country should
require it. A similar generosity was expected on the part of the emigrated
bishops. Have they been to blame in refusing? <a name="let47fr1"></a>This
question may, in a great measure, depend on the arrangement of the Concordat,
and the imperious and menacing tone of the court of Rome which demanded of them
the resignation of their former sees.[<a href="#let47f1">1</a>]</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let47f1">Footnote 1</a>: For the gratification of the
reader is here annexed an account of the Pope's conduct in regard to the
constitutional clergy, since the promulgation of the Concordat.</p>
<p class="fnt">At length the nominations took place. A small number of those
appointed to the sixty new dioceses, were taken from the constitutional clergy.
The others were taken from the mass of the refractory and those who had
retracted, and the greater number formed the most eloquent apology of the
constitutional bishops. They all received the institution from the Pope, who
announced it with an air of triumph to the college of Cardinals, in his
collocution of the 24th of May, 1802. He had good reason to congratulate
himself at this epoch, the more so as he had been made to believe that the
re-elected constitutional clergy had made a retraction, and received penitence
and absolution. The author of this calumny was BERNIER, who had been charged
by the Cardinal Legate with a step so worthy of his former military exploits.
It was solemnly contradicted. After the decree of absolution which BERNIER had
ventured to present to these bishops was thrown with indignation into the fire
of PORTALIS, the counsellor of state charged by the government with religious
affairs, who was witness to the transaction. Indeed, he had in this encouraged
the bishops to imitate his own example in getting rid, by the same means, of a
brief which the Legate had transmitted to him in order to absolve him from the
guilt he might have incurred by taking part in the revolution.</p>
<p class="fnt">The government wished to pacify religious troubles; but the
majority of the dissentient bishops began to foment new disputes, by requiring
retractations from the constitutional clergy, who, for the most part, have
stood firm amidst privations of every description. However, the mischief made
not the progress which there was every reason to apprehend: the government
pronounced its opinion thereon by prohibiting bishops from requiring any thing
more than submission to the Concordat, and obedience to the new bishops.
Notwithstanding the wise intentions of the government, sincerely desirous of
peace and concord, it is only in the dioceses fallen to the constitutional
bishops that a good understanding prevails. Most of the disentient clergy
continue to promote discord, and torment their constitutional brethren.
BOISCHOLLET, bishop of Séez, MONTAULT, bishop of Angers, and some others, have
been sent for to Paris, in order to be reprimanded and cautioned to behave
better.</p>
<p class="fnt">It is proper to mention the documents which Cardinal CAPRARA has
distributed to all the bishops. They form a collection of thirteen papers,
which might not improperly be called an analysis of the decretals of Isidorus.
On these, no doubt, good canonists will debate at some future day, in order to
shame the court of Rome, by pointing out its absurdities and blunders; and
certainly the respect which catholics owe to the Holy See ought not to prevent
then from resisting the pretensions of the
Pope.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let47fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let48">LETTER XLVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 10, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Going the other day to call on M. S----i, I stopped by the way, to examine
an edifice which, when I first visited Paris in 1784, engaged no small share of
public attention. It was, at that time, one of the principal objects pointed
out to the curiosity of strangers. At one period of the revolution, you will,
doubtless, recollect the frequent mention made of the</p>
<p class="center">PANTHEON.</p>
<p>Conceive my surprise, on learning that this stately building, after having
employed the hands of so many men, for the best part of half a century, was not
only still unfinished; but had threatened approaching ruin. Yes&mdash;like the
Gothic abbey at Fonthill, it would, by all accounts, have fallen to the ground,
without the aid of vandalism, had not prompt and efficacious measures been
adopted, to avert the impending mischief.</p>
<p>This monument, originally intended for the reception of the shrine of St.
Geneviève, once the patroness of the Parisians, is situated on an eminence,
formerly called <i>Mont St. Étienne</i>, to the left of the top of the <i>Rue
St. Jacques</i>, near the <i>Place de l'Estrapade</i>. It was begun under the
reign of Lewis XV, who laid the first stone on the 6th of September, 1764.
During the American war, the works were suspended; but, early in the year 1784,
they were resumed with increasing activity. The sculpture of this church
already presented many attributes analogous to its object, when, in 1793, it
was converted into a Pantheon.</p>
<p>The late M. SOUFFLOT furnished the plan for the church, which, in point of
magnificence, does honour both to the architect and to the nation.</p>
<p>Its form is a Greek cross, three hundred and forty feet in length by two
hundred and fifty in breadth. The porch, which is an imitation of that of the
Pantheon at Rome, consists of a peristyle of twenty-two pillars of the
Corinthian order. Eighteen of these are insulated, and are each five feet and a
half in diameter by fifty-eight in height, including their base and capital.
They support a pediment, which combines the boldness of the Gothic with the
beauty of the Greek style. This pediment bears the following inscription:</p>
<p class="bq">"AUX GRANDS HOMMES,<br />
LA PATRIE RECONNAISSANTE."</p>
<p>In the delirium of the revolutionary fever, when great crimes constituted
great men, this sanctuary of national gratitude was polluted. MARAT, that man
of blood, was, to use the modern phraseology, <i>pantheonized</i>, that is,
interred in the Pantheon. When the delirium had, in some measure, subsided, and
reason began to resume her empire, he was <i>dispantheonized</i>; and, by means
of quick-lime, his canonized bones were confounded with the dust. This
apotheosis will ever be a blot in the page of the history of the
revolution.</p>
<p>However, it operated as a check on the inconsiderate zeal of hot-brained
patriots in bestowing the honours of the Pantheon on the undeserving. MIRABEAU
was, consequently, <i>dispantheonized</i>; and, in all probability, this temple
will, in future, be reserved for the ashes of men truly great; legislators
whose eminent talents and virtues have benefited their fellow-citizens, or
warriors, who, by distinguishing themselves in their country's cause, have
really merited that country's gratitude.</p>
<p>The interior of this temple consists of four naves, in whose centre rises an
elegant dome, which, it is said, is to be painted in fresco by DAVID. The naves
are decorated by one hundred and thirty fluted pillars, also of the Corinthian
order, supporting an entablature, which serves as a base for lofty
<i>tribunes</i>, bordered by stone balustrades. These pillars are three feet
and a half in diameter by nearly twenty-eight feet in height.</p>
<p>The inside of the dome is incircled by sixteen Corinthian pillars, standing
at an equal distance, and lighted by glazed apertures in part of the
intercolumniations. They support a cupola, in the centre of which is an
opening, crowned by another cupola of much more considerable elevation.</p>
<p>To survey the interior of the Pantheon, in its present state, is rather a
matter of eager curiosity than of pleasing enjoyment. The precautions taken to
prevent the fall of the whole building, which was apprehended from the almost
tottering state of the dome, have necessitated the erection of such a quantity
of scaffolding, that it is no easy task to gain an uninterrupted view of its
majestic pillars, of the delicate and light foliage of its capitals, and of its
proud and triple canopy. I mounted the ladders, and braved the dust of stone
and plaster, amidst the echoing sound of saws, chisels, and mallets, at work in
different directions.</p>
<p>Mercier is said to have offended several of the partisans of Voltaire by
observing that, through a strange inconsistency, the constant flatterer not
only of royalty in general, but of kings in particular, and of all the great
men and vices of the age in which he lived, here shares the gratitude of a
republic with the <i>man of nature and truth</i>, as Jean-Jacques is styled on
his sepulchral monument. Thus, in the first instance, says he, a temple,
consecrated to stern republican virtue, contains the remains of a great poet
who could not strike superstition, without wounding
morals.&mdash;Unquestionably, the <i>Pucelle</i> is a work, which, like a
blight on a promising crop, has committed incalculable ravage among the rising
generation. Notwithstanding the numerous inscriptions which now adorn the tomb
of Voltaire, perhaps, at some future distant period, he may experience the fate
of Mirabeau, and be <i>dispantheonized</i>.</p>
<p>But why meddle with the cold remains of any great genius? Would it not have
been more rational to inscribe the name of Rousseau in this national temple,
and leave his corpse to rot undisturbed, in the <i>Ile des Peupliers</i>, at
Ermenonville.</p>
<p>Though circumstances prevented me from ascending to the dome, you will, no
doubt, expect me to say something of its exterior architecture. It represents a
circular temple, formed by thirty-four pillars, like those of the interior, of
the Corinthian order, and each, base and capital included, thirty-four feet in
height by three feet and one third in diameter. This colonnade is supported by
a circular stylobate, which rests on an octagon base, and is surrounded by a
gallery, bordered by an iron balustrade. The cupola, rising above the attic,
would appear crushed, were not a stranger apprised that the pedestal on the top
is to be surmounted by a bronze figure of Fame, twenty-eight feet in height,
and weighing fifty-two thousand pounds. The pedestal is encircled by a second
gallery at an elevation of one hundred and sixty-six feet, to reach which you
ascend a flight of four hundred and sixty stone steps. As the Pantheon itself
stands on a considerable eminence, the prospect from this gallery is extensive
and commanding.</p>
<p>This sumptuous edifice may truly be said to exhibit a monument of the
weakness of man. Like him, before arrived at maturity, it is attacked by
indisposition. The architects, like so many physicians, were not for some time
agreed as to the seat of the evil. Each proposed his means of cure as the most
infallible; But all coincided in one opinion, that the danger was imminent.
Their skill has been exerted, and, no doubt, with effect; for all apprehension
of further mischief is now removed.</p>
<p>When I was taking a last look at this proud temple, I could not help
regretting that one half of the money already expended on it, had not been
appropriated to the erection of airy hospitals in the different quarters of
this populous city. Any one who had formerly visited the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> in
Paris would, I am confident, have participated in this sentiment.</p>
<p>What strange fatality impels men to persevere in such unprofitable
erections? This was the first question which suggested itself to me, on getting
fairly out of the Pantheon. Is it to gratify an excess of national vanity, or
create a superior degree of admiration in the mind of foreigners? If so, the
aim is missed: for, as majesty, fallen from the pinnacle of power, becomes more
interesting, so do ruins inspire greater veneration than the most pompous
structure, towering in the splendour of its perfection. Experience tells us
that every truncated pillar, every remnant, in short, of past grandeur, rouses
attention, and speaks home to the contemplative mind; while these modern
edifices, however firmly erect on their base, excite, comparatively speaking,
but a feeble interest. In future ages, perhaps, when the Pantheon of Paris
shall be prostrate on the ground, and the wreck of its stately dome be overrun
with moss and ivy, it may, probably, attract as much notice as the far-tamed
temple of Jupiter-Ammon.</p>
<p>P.S. On the evening of the 8th, BONAPARTE left Paris for Lyons, where
TALLEYRAND, Minister for foreign affairs, has been for some days preparing for
the great event which is expected to take place. When a public measure is in
agitation, the result is generally anticipated by the eagerness of mankind; and
whispers the least audible are magnified into authentic information. Those even
who may be presumed to derive their intelligence from the best sources, not
unfrequently misconceive what they have heard, and consequently mislead others.
I will not, however, mislead you, by repeating any of the rumours in
circulation here: in a short time, the <i>Moniteur</i> will, no doubt, explain
the real object of this journey.</p>
<h2><a name="let49">LETTER XLIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 12,1802.</i></p>
<p>As no city in Europe presents so many advantages as this for the cultivation
of literature, arts, and sciences, it is not surprising that it should contain
great numbers of literati, artists, and men of science, who form themselves
into different associations. Independently of the National Institute, Paris can
boast of several other</p>
<p class="center">SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES.</p>
<p>The following are the names of those held in most esteem.</p>
<p>SOCIÉTÉ PHILOTECHNIQUE.<br />
SOCIÉTÉ LIBRE DES SCIENCES, LETTRES, ET ARTS.<br />
ATHÉNÉE (<i>ci-devant</i> LYCÉE) DES ARTS.<br />
SOCIÉTÉ PHILOMATIQUE.<br />
SOCIÉTÉ ACADÉMIQUE DES SCIENCES.<br />
SOCIÉTÉ GALVANIQUE.<br />
SOCIÉTÉ DES BELLES-LETTRES.<br />
ACADÉMIE DE LÉGISLATION.<br />
OBSERVATEURS DE L'HOMME.<br />
ATHÉNÉE DE PARIS, <i>ci-devant</i> LYCÉE RÉPUBLICAIN.</p>
<p>Though, in all these societies, you may meet with a great number of
estimable men, many of whose names may be found in the major part of them, yet
that which holds the first rank in the public esteem, as well from the
respectability of the members of whom it is composed, as from the proofs of
talents which are necessary in order to be admitted into it, is the</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ PHILOTECHNIQUE.</p>
<p>Indeed, almost all its members are men whose works hove rendered them
celebrated throughout Europe. Hitherto, with the exception of the National
Institute, this is the only society to which the government has granted the
honour of receiving it as a body, or by deputation, on solemn occasions; and by
that alone, it has <i>nationalized</i>, at least tacitly, its institution. It
is also the only one which, to the present moment, has preserved the right of
holding its public and private sittings in the <i>Louvre</i>, since that palace
has been ordered to be wholly evacuated. A report has been spread that the hall
of the <i>ci-devant</i> French Academy is destined for it; but as yet nothing
is determined in this respect.</p>
<p>Its number is confined to sixty resident members, and twenty free associates
or veterans. It is necessary to have been ten years among the resident members,
in order to have a right to be admitted into the number of the twenty free
associates, who enjoy prerogatives, without being bound to take a part in the
labours of the society. This favour, however, may be granted to those who are
for a time called from Paris by public functions, such as embassies,
prefectures, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This society meets on the 2nd, 12th and 22nd of every month at seven o'clock
in the evening. Its various committees have their particular days for
assembling. Its officers consist of a President, a Vice-President, a general
and perpetual Secretary, a temporary Secretary, a Treasurer, and a Keeper of
the records.</p>
<p>It holds its public sittings at noon on the last Sunday of the second month
of every <i>trimestre</i>, or quarter of the republican year, namely, Brumaire,
Pluviôse, Floréal, and Thermidor.</p>
<p>It is composed of men of science, literati, and artists; but, resembling a
family rather than a society, its principles of friendship admit of no classes.
On the 19th of every month, it celebrates its foundation by an entertainment,
at which its members have the liberty of introducing their friends.</p>
<p>It reckons among its members, in the Sciences, LACÉPÈDE, FOURCROY, CUVIER,
GEOFFROY, ROTROU, RUEL, LE CLERC, GAUTHEROT, GINGEMBRE, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In Literature, BOUFFLERS, LEGOUVÉ, ANDRIEUX, JOSEPH LAVALLÉE, MARIUS ARNAUD,
SICARD, GUILLARD, GUICHARD, FRANÇOIS DE NEUFCHÂTEAU, MARGOURIT, RENAUD DE ST.

Dancing, REGNAULT, VALENCIENNES, SILVESTRE the Father, BARBIER the elder,

<p>The general and perpetual Secretary is JOSEPH LAVALLÉE.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ, LIBRE DES. SCIENCES, LETTRES, ET ARTS.</p>
<p>It is composed of the junction of the old <i>Museum of Paris</i> and of the
Society called that of the <i>Nine Sisters</i>. It is divided into classes, is
unlimited in the number of its members, admits associated correspondents and
foreigners, holds its private sittings at the <i>Oratoire</i> in the <i>Rue St.
Honoré</i>, every Thursday, and its public ones at six o'clock in the evening
on the 9th of the first months of the <i>trimestre</i>; namely, Vendémiaire,
Nivôse, Germinal, and Messidor. Its officers consist of a President, taken
alternately from the three classes, of two temporary Secretaries, a Treasurer,
and a Keeper of the records.</p>
<p>This Society is modelled a little too much after the Institute, and it is
easy to see that the former aims at rivaling the latter. This <i>esprit de
corps</i>, which cannot well be perceived but by nice observers, has this
advantage; it inspires a sort of emulation. But the society having neglected to
limit the number of its members, and having thereby deprived itself of the
means of appearing difficult as to admission, it thence results that its
labours are not equally stamped with the impression of real talent; and if, in
fact, it be ambitious, that is a great obstacle to its views.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="let49fr1"></a>ATHENÉE (<i>ci-devant</i> LYCÉE) DES
ARTS.[<a href="#let49f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>In imitation of our Royal Society, it comprises not only the sciences,
literature, and the arts, but also arts and trades, mechanics, inventions,
&amp;c. Its members are not idle, and they are a useful body, as they excite
emulation by medals, civic crowns, premiums, and rewards. Their number is
considerable and unlimited; a condition which is an evil in the last-mentioned
society, and a good in this, whose nature is not so much to shine as to
encourage industry.</p>
<p>It was for a while in disrepute, because DESAUDRAY, the director who founded
it, exercised over it a tyrannic sway; it has succeeded in getting rid of him,
and, since then, several persons of merit, who had before kept aloof, aspire to
the honour of being admitted into it.</p>
<p>For some time past it has adopted a custom, too obsequious and absurd, of
choosing none but ministers for its Presidents. By this, it exposes its liberty
and its opinion, and gives itself chains, the weight of which it will feel some
day, when too late to shake them off.</p>
<p>It holds its general sittings at the <i>Oratoire</i> every Monday, when it
hears the reports of its numerous committees, who have their particular days
for meeting. Its public sittings are held at the same place, but at no fixed
periods.</p>
<p>Its officers consist of a President, a Vice-President, two Secretaries,
three Conservators, a Treasurer, and a Keeper of the records.</p>
<p>It has associated correspondents throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ PHILOMATIQUE.</p>
<p>It is wholly devoted to natural, physical, and mathematical sciences. It
assembles on Fridays, in the <i>Rue d'Anjou</i>, <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>.
It has no public sittings; but is merely a private meeting of men of learning,
who publish once a month a <i>bulletin</i> very important to the sciences, and
to be commended, besides, for its composition, perspicuity, and conciseness.
This publication is of a 4to size, consists of a single sheet of print, and has
for its title <i>Bulletin des Sciences par la Société Philomatique</i>.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ ACADÉMIQUE DES SCIENCES.</p>
<p>This Society is recently formed: It employs itself on the Sciences only; has
not yet held any public sittings, nor published any memoirs. Consequently,
nothing can yet be said of its labours, or interior regulation.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ GALVANIQUE.</p>
<p>Its name indicates the sole object of its labours. It is newly formed, and
composed of men eminently distinguished in Medicine and Physics. It has called
in a few literati. Its officers are the same in the other Societies. It holds
its sittings at the <i>Oratoire</i> every Tuesday at eleven o'clock in the
morning. Its labours are pursued with ardour and it has already made several
important experiments. It announces zeal, and talents, as well as-great
defects, and aspires to fame, perhaps, a little too much; but it may still
maintain its ground.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ DES BELLES-LETTRES.</p>
<p>It is somewhat frivolous. Public sittings every month. Half poetry, half
music. It meets at the <i>Oratoire</i> every Wednesday at seven o'clock in the
evening. It arose from a small emigration of the <i>Lycée des Arts</i>, at this
day <i>l'Athénée</i>, during the tyranny of DESAUDRAY, and originally bore the
title of <i>Rosati</i>. A few men of merit, a great number of youths, and some
useless members. Too many futile readings, too many fugitive verses, too many
little rivalships. It is faulty on account of its regulations, the basis of
which is weak, and it exhibits too much parsimony in its expenses. It has not
enough of that public consideration which perpetuates establishments of this
description. Under such circumstances, it is to be apprehended that it will not
support itself.</p>
<p class="center">ACADÉMIE DE LÉGISLATION.</p>
<p>This is a fine institution, recently founded. It is composed of the most
celebrated lawyers, and a few distinguished literati. It meets on the first of
every month, gives every day courses of lectures on all the branches of
jurisprudence to a great number of pupils; has established conferences, where
these pupils form themselves to the art of speaking, by pleading on given
points of law. It publishes two periodical works every month, the one entitled,
<i>Bulletin de Jurisprudence</i> and the other, <i>Annales de
Jurisprudence.</i> The preliminary discourse of the first volume of the latter
is by JOSEPH LAVALLÉE, and has done him considerable credit. He is, however, a
literary character, and not a lawyer.</p>
<p>This academy has officers of the same description as those of the other
Societies. Senator LANJUINAIS is the President at this moment. It occupies the
<i>Hôtel de la Briffe</i>, <i>Quai Voltaire</i>.</p>
<p class="center">SOCIÉTÉ DES OBSERVATEURS DE L'HOMME.</p>
<p>It assembles at the <i>Hôtel de la Rochefoucauld</i>, <i>Rue de Seine</i>,
<i>Faubourg St. Germain,</i> and is composed of very estimable men. Its
labours, readings, and discussions are too metaphysical. In point of officers,
it is formed like the other Societies. Citizen JUAFFRET is perpetual
Secretary.</p>
<p class="center">ATHÉNÉE DE PARIS, <i>ci-devant</i> LYCÉE RÉPUBLICAIN.</p>
<p>This society has survived the revolutionary storm, having been established
as far back as the year 1787. According to the <i>programme</i> published for
the present year 1802, its object is to propagate the culture of the sciences
and literature; to make known the useful improvements in the arts; to afford
pleasure to persons of all ages, by presenting to every one such attractions as
may suit his taste, and to unite in literary conferences the charms of the
mildest of human occupations.</p>
<p>To strangers, the <i>Athénée</i> holds out many advantages. On being
presented by one of the founders or a subscriber, and paying the annual
subscription of 96 francs, you receive an admission-ticket, which, however, is
not transferrable. This entitles you to attend several courses of lectures by
some of the most eminent professors, such as FOURCROY, CUVIER, LA HARPE,
DÉGÉRANDO, SUË, HASSENFRATZ, LEGRAND, &amp;c. The subjects for the year are as
follows:</p>
<p>Experimental Physics, Chymistry, Natural History, Anatomy and Physiology,
Botany, Technology or the application of sciences to arts and trades,
Literature, Moral Philosophy, Architecture, together with the English, Italian,
and German languages.</p>
<p>The lectures are always delivered twice, and not unfrequently thrice a day,
in a commodious room, provided with all the apparatus necessary for
experiments. On a Sunday, an account of the order in which they are to be given
in the course of the following week, is sent to every subscriber. There is no
half-subscription, nor any admission <i>gratis</i>; but ladies pay no more than
48 francs for their annual ticket.</p>
<p>Independently of so many sources of instruction, the <i>Athénée</i>, as is
expressed in the <i>programme</i>, really affords to subscribers the resources
and charms of a numerous and select society. The apartments, which are situated
near the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, in the <i>Rue du Lycée</i>, are open to
them from nine o'clock in the morning to eleven at night. Several rooms are
appropriated to conversation; one of which, provided with a piano-forte and
music, serves as a rendezvous for the ladies. The subscribers have free access
to the library, where they find the principal literary and political journals
and papers, both French and others, as well as every new publication of
importance. A particular room, in which silence is duly observed, is set apart
for reading.</p>
<p><a name="let49f1">Footnote 1</a>: This Society has laid aside the title of
<i>Lyceum</i> since the decree of the government, which declares that this
denomination is to be applied only to the establishments for public
instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let49fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let50">LETTER L.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 13, 1802.</i></p>
<p>I have spoken to you of palaces, museum, churches, bridges, public gardens,
playhouses, &amp;c. as they have chanced to fall under my observation; but
there still remain houses of more than one description which I have not yet
noticed, though they are certainly more numerous here than in any other city in
Europe. I shall now speak of</p>
<p class="center">COFFEEHOUSES.</p>
<p>Their number in Paris has been reckoned to exceed seven hundred; but they
are very far from enjoying a comparative degree of reputation. Celebrity is
said to be confined to about a dozen only, which have risen into superior
consequence from various causes. Except a few resorted to by the literati or
wits of the day, or by military officers, they are, in general, the rendezvous
of the idle, and the refuge of the needy. This is so true, that a frequenter of
a coffeehouse scarcely ever lights a fire in his own lodging during the whole
winter. No sooner has he quitted his bed, and equipped himself for the day,
than he repairs to his accustomed haunt, where he arrives about ten o'clock in
the morning, and remains till eleven at night, the hour at which coffeehouses
are shut up, according to the regulation of the police. Not unfrequently
persons of this description make a cup of coffee, mixed with milk, with the
addition of a penny-roll, serve for dinner; and, be their merit what it may,
they are seldom so fortunate as to be consoled by the offer of a rich man's
table.</p>
<p>Here, no person who wishes to be respected, thinks of lounging in a
coffeehouse, because it not only shews him to be at a loss to spend his time,
which may fairly be construed into a deficiency of education or knowledge, but
also implies an absolute want of acquaintance with what is termed good company.
Certain it is that, with the exceptions before-mentioned, a stranger must not
look for good company in a coffee-house in Paris; if he does, he will find
himself egregiously disappointed.</p>
<p>Having occasion to see an advertisement in an English newspaper, I went a
few evenings ago to one of the most distinguished places of this sort in the
<i>Palais du Tribunat</i>: the room was extremely crowded. In five minutes, one
of the company whom I had seen taking out his watch on my entrance, missed it;
and though many of the by-standers afterwards said they had no doubt that a
person of gentlemanly exterior, who stood near him, had taken it, still it
would have been useless to charge that person with the fact, as the watch had
instantly gone through many hands, and the supposed accomplices had been
observed to decamp with uncommon expedition. What diverted me not a little, was
that the person suspected coolly descanted on the imprudence of taking out a
valuable watch in a crowd of strangers; and, after declaiming the most virulent
terms against the dishonesty of mankind; he walked away very quietly.
Notwithstanding his appearance and manner were so much in his favour, he had no
sooner affected his retreat than some subalterns of the police, not
thief-takers, but <i>mouchards</i> or spies, some of whom are to be met with in
every principal coffeehouse, cautioned the master of the house against
suffering his presence in future, as he was a notorious adventurer.</p>
<p>You must not, however, imagine from this incident, that a man cannot enter a
coffeehouse in Paris, without being a sufferer from the depredations of the
nimble-fingered gentry. Such instances are not, I believe, very frequent here;
and though it is universally allowed that this capital abounds with adventurers
and pickpockets of every description, I am of opinion that there is far less
danger to be apprehended from them than from their archetypes in London.
Everyone knows that, in our refined metropolis, a lady of fashion cannot give a
ball or a rout, without engaging Mr. Townsend, or some other Bow street
officer, to attend in her ball, in order that his presence may operate as a
check on the audacity of knavish intruders.</p>
<p>The principle coffeehouses here are fitted up with taste and elegance. Large
mirrors form no inconsiderable part of their decoration. There are no
partitions to divide them into boxes. The tables are of marble; the benches and
stools are covered with Utrecht velvet. In winter, an equal degree of warmth is
preserved in them by means of a large stove in the centre, which, from its
figure, is an ornamental piece of furniture; while, in summer, the draught of
air which it maintains, contributes not a little to cool the room. In the
evening, they are lighted by <i>quinquets</i> in a brilliant manner.</p>
<p>Formerly, every coffeehouse in Paris used to have its chief orator; in those
of the more remote part of the suburbs you might, I am informed, hear a
journeyman tailor or shoemaker hold forth on various topics. With the
revolution, politics were introduced; but, at the present day, that is a
subject which seems to be entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>In some coffeehouses, where literati and critics assemble, authors and their
works are passed in review, and to each is assigned his rank and estimation.
When one of these happens to have been checked in his dramatic career by an
<i>undiscerning</i> public, he becomes, in his turn, the most merciless of
critics.</p>
<p>In many of these places, the "busy hum" is extremely tiresome; German,
Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Russ, together with English and French, all
spoken at the same time and in the same room, make a confusion of tongues as
great almost as that which reigned at Babel. In addition to the French
newspapers, those of England and Germany may be read; but as they are often
bespoke by half a dozen persons in succession, it requires no small degree of
patience to wait while these quidnuncs are conning over every paragraph.</p>
<p>Independently of coffee, tea, and chocolate, ices, punch and liqueurs may be
had in the principal coffeehouses; but nothing in the way of dinner or supper,
except at the subterraneous ones in the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, though there
are many of a rather inferior order where substantial breakfasts in the French
style are provided. Whether Voltaire's idea be just, that coffee clears the
brain, and stimulates the genius, I will not pretend to determine: but if this
be really the case, it is no wonder that the French are so lively and full of
invention; for coffee is an article of which they make an uncommon consumption.
Indeed, if Fame may be credited, the prior of a monastery in Arabia, on the
word of a shepherd who had remarked that his goats were particularly frisky
when they had eaten the berries of the coffee-tree, first made a trial of their
virtue on the monks of his convent, in order to prevent them from sleeping
during divine service.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, Soliman Aga, ambassador of the Porte to Lewis XIV, in
1669, was the first who introduced the use of coffee in Paris. During a
residence of ten years in the French capital, he had conciliated the friendship
of many persons of distinction, and the ladies in particular took a pleasure in
visiting him. According to the custom of his country, he presented them with
coffee; and this beverage, however disgusting from its colour and bitterness,
was well received, because it was offered by a foreigner, in beautiful china
cups, on napkins ornamented with gold fringe. On leaving the ambassador's
parties, each of the guests, in the enthusiasm of novelty, cried up coffee, and
took means to procure it. A few years after, (in 1672) one Paschal, an
Armenian, first opened, at the <i>Foire St. Germain</i>, and, afterwards on the
<i>Quai de l'École</i>, a shop similar to those which he had seen in the
Levant, and called his new establishment <i>café</i>. Other Levantines followed
his example; but, to fix the fickle Parisian, required a coffeeroom handsomely
decorated. PROCOPE acted on this plan, and his house was successively
frequented by Voltaire, Piron, Fontenelle, and St. Foix.</p>
<p>As drinking, which was then in vogue, was pursued less on account of the
pleasure which it afforded, than for the sake of society, the French made no
hesitation in deserting the tavern for the coffeehouse. But, in making this
exchange, it has been remarked, by the observers of the day, that they have not
only lost their taste for conviviality, but are become more reserved and
insincere than their forefathers, whose hearts expanded by the free use of the
generous juice of the grape; thus verifying the old maxim, <i>in vino
veritas.</i></p>
<p>No small attraction to a Parisian coffeehouse is a pretty female to preside
in the bar, and in a few I have seen very handsome women; though this post is
commonly assigned to the mistress or some confidential female relation. Beset
as they are from morn to night by an endless variety of flatterers, the virtue
of a Lucretia could scarcely resist such incessant temptation. In general, they
are coquetish; but, without coquetry, would they be deemed qualified for their
employment?</p>
<p>Before the revolution, I remember, in the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i>, a
coffeehouse called <i>Le café mécanique</i>. The mechanical contrivance, whence
it derived its name, was of the most simple nature. The tables stood on hollow
cylinders, the tops of which, resembling a salver with its border, were level
with the plane of the table, but connected with the kitchen underneath. In the
bar sat a fine, showy lady, who repeated your order to the attendants below, by
means of a speaking-trumpet. Presently the superficial part of the salver,
descended through the cylinder, and reascending immediately, the article called
for made its appearance. This <i>café méchanique</i> did not long remain in
being, as it was not found to answer the expectation of the projector. But
besides six or seven coffeehouses on the ground-floor of the <i>Palais du
Tribunat</i>, there are also several subterraneous ones now open.</p>
<p>In one of these, near the <i>Théâtre Français,</i> is a little stage, on
which farces, composed for the purpose, are represented <i>gratis</i>. In
another, is an orchestra consisting entirely of performers belonging to the
National Institution of the Blind. In a third, on the north side of the garden,
are a set of musicians, both vocal and instrumental, who apparently never tire;
for I am told they never cease to play and sing, except to retune their
instruments. Here a female now and then entertains the company with a solo on
the French horn. To complete the sweet melody, a merry-andrew habited <i>à la
sauvage</i>, "struts his hour" on a place about six feet in length, and
performs a thousand ridiculous antics, at the same time flogging and beating
alternately a large drum, the thunder-like sound of which is almost loud enough
to give every auditor's brain a momentary concussion.</p>
<p>A fourth subterraneous coffeehouse in the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i> is kept
by a ventriloquist, and here many a party are amused by one of their number
being repeatedly led into a mistake, in consequence of being ignorant of the
faculty possessed by the master of the house. This man seems to have no small
share of humour, and exercises it apparently much to his advantage. In three
visits which I paid to his cellar, the crowd was so great that it was extremely
difficult to approach the scene of action, so as to be able to enjoy the effect
of his ludicrous deceptions.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, well acquainted with the proper time for visiting every
place of public resort in Paris, conducted me to all these subterraneous
coffeehouses on a Sunday evening, when they were so full that we had some
difficulty to find room to stand, for to find a seat was quite impossible. Such
a diversity of character I never before witnessed in the compass of so small a
space. However, all was mirth and good-humour. I know not how they contrive to
keep these places cool in summer; for, in the depth of winter, a more than
genial warmth prevails in them, arising from the confined breath of such a
concourse. On approaching the stair-case, if the orchestra be silent, the
entrance of these regions of harmony is announced by a heat which can be
compared only to the true Sirocco blast such as you have experienced at
Naples.</p>
<h2><a name="let51">LETTER LI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 15, 1802.</i></p>
<p>As after one of those awful and violent convulsions of nature which rend the
bosom of the earth, and overthrow the edifices standing on its surface, men
gradually repair the mischief it has occasioned, so the French, on the ruins of
the ancient colleges and universities, which fell in the shock of the
revolution, have from time to time reared new seminaries of learning, and
endeavoured to organize, on a more liberal and patriotic scale, institutions
for</p>
<p class="center">PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.</p>
<p>The vast field which the organization of public instruction presents to the
imagination has, as may be, supposed, given birth to a great number of systems
more or less practicable; but, hitherto, it should seem that political
oscillations have imprinted on all the new institutions a character of weakness
which, if it did not absolutely threaten speedy ruin, announced at least that
they would not be lasting. When the germs of discord prevailed, it was not
likely that men's minds should be in that tranquil state necessary for the
reestablishment of public seminaries, to lay the foundations of which, in a
solid and durable manner, required the calm of peace and the forgetfulness of
misfortune.</p>
<p>After the suppression of the colleges and universities existing under the
monarchy, and to which the <i>Collège de France</i> in Paris is the sole
exception, the National Convention, by a decree of the 24th of Nivôse, year III
(14th of January 1795) established <i>Normal</i> Schools throughout the
Republic. Professors and teachers were appointed to them; and it was intended
that, in these nurseries, youth should be prepared for the higher schools,
according to the new plan of instruction. However, in less than a year, these
<i>Normal</i> Schools were shut up; and, by a law of the 3d of Brumaire, year
IV (25th of October, 1796) Primary, Secondary, and Central Schools were ordered
to be established in every department.</p>
<p>In the Primary Schools, reading, writing, and arithmetic formed the chief
part of the instruction. Owing to various causes, the Secondary Schools, I
understand, were never established. In the Central Schools, the internal
regulation was to be as follows.</p>
<p>The whole of the instruction was divided into three classes or sections. In
the first, were taught drawing, natural history, and ancient and modern
languages. In the second, mathematics, physics, and chymistry. In the third,
universal grammar, the fine arts, history, and legislation. Into the first
class the pupils were to be received at the age of twelve; into the second, at
fourteen; and into the third, at sixteen. In each Central School were to be a
public library, a botanic garden, and an apparatus of chymical and physical
instruments. The professors were to be examined and chosen by a <i>Jury of
Instruction</i>, and that choice confirmed by the administration of the
department.</p>
<p>The government, in turning its attention to the present state of the public
schools, and comparing them with the wants and wishes of the inhabitants of the
Republic, has found that the Primary Schools have been greatly neglected, and
that the Central Schools have not been of so much utility as was expected.
Alarmed at the consequences likely to be produced by a state of things which
leaves a great part of the present generation destitute of the first rudiments
of knowledge, the government has felt that the reorganization of these schools
is become an urgent duty, and that it is impossible to delay longer to carry it
into execution.</p>
<p>The <i>Special</i> Schools of Arts and Sciences are mostly confined to
Paris. The other rich and populous cities of the Republic have undoubtedly a
claim to similar institutions. There is at present no School of Jurisprudence,
and but one of Medicine.</p>
<p><a name="let51fr1"></a>The celebrated FOURCROY[<a href="#let51f1">1</a>] has
been some time engaged in drawing up a plan for the improvement of public
instruction. In seeking a new mode of teaching appropriate to the present state
of knowledge and to the genius of the French nation, he has thought it
necessary to depart from the beaten track. Enlightened by the past, he has
rejected the ancient forms of the universities, whose philosophy and
acquirements, for half a century past, called for reformation, and no longer
kept pace with the progress of reason. In the Central Schools he saw
institutions few in number, and too uniformly organized for departments varying
in population, resources, and means. He has, nevertheless, taken what was good
in each of these two systems successively adopted, and removed their abuses.
Without losing sight of the success due to good masters and skilful professors,
he has, above all, thought of the means of insuring the success of the new
schools by the competition of the scholars. He is of opinion that to found
literary and scientific institutions on a solid basis, it is necessary to begin
by attaching to them pupils, and filling the classes with students, in order
not to run the risk of filling them with professors. Such is the object which
FOURCROY wishes to attain, by creating a number of national pensions, so
considerable that their funds, when distributed in the Lyceums, may be
sufficient for their support.</p>
<p>Agreeably to these ideas, the following is said to be the outline of the new
organization of public instruction. It is to be divided into four classes; viz.
Primary Schools, Secondary Schools, Lyceums, and Special Schools.</p>
<p class="center">PRIMARY SCHOOLS.</p>
<p>A Primary School may belong to several <i>communes</i> at a time, according
to the population and the locality of these <i>communes</i>.</p>
<p>The teachers are to be chosen by the mayors and municipal councils.</p>
<p>The under-prefects are to be specially charged with the organization of
these schools, and give an account of their state, once a month, to the
prefects.</p>
<p class="center">SECONDARY SCHOOLS.</p>
<p>Every school established in the <i>commune</i> or kept by private
individuals, in which are taught the Latin and French languages, the first
principles of geography, history and mathematics, is to be considered as a
Secondary School.</p>
<p>The government promises to encourage the establishment of Secondary Schools,
and reward the good instruction that shall be given in them, either by granting
a spot for keeping them, or by the distribution of gratuitous places in the
Lyceums, to such of the pupils as shall have distinguished themselves most, and
by gratifications to the fifty masters who shall have qualified most pupils for
the Lyceums.</p>
<p>No Secondary School is to be established without the authority of the
government. The Secondary Schools and private schools, whose instruction is
found superior to that of the Primary Schools, are to be placed under the
superintendance and particular inspection of the prefects.</p>
<p class="center">LYCEUMS.</p>
<p>There is to be one Lyceum at least in the district of every tribunal of
appeal.</p>
<p>Here are to be taught ancient languages, rhetoric, logic, morality, and the
elements of the mathematical and physical sciences. To these are to be added
drawing, military exercises and the agreeable arts.</p>
<p>Instruction is to be given to the pupils placed here by the government, to
those of the Secondary Schools admitted through competition, to those whose
parents may put them here as boarders, and also to day-scholars.</p>
<p>In each Lyceum is to be a director, who is to have immediately under him a
censor of studies, and an administrator who are all to be nominated by the
First Consul.</p>
<p>In the former institutions, which are to be replaced by these new ones, a
vigilant eye was not constantly kept on the state of the schools themselves,
nor on that of the studies pursued in them. According to the new plan, three
inspectors-general, appointed by the First Consul, are to visit them carefully,
and report to the government their situation, success, and defects. This new
supervisorship is to be, as it were, the key-stone of the arch, and to keep all
the parts connected.</p>
<p>The fourth and highest degree of public instruction is to be acquired in
the</p>
<p class="center">SPECIAL SCHOOLS.</p>
<p>This is the name to be applied to those of the upper schools, where are
particularly taught, and in the most profound manner, the useful sciences,
jurisprudence, medicine, natural history, &amp;c. But schools of this kind must
not be confounded with the Schools for Engineers, Artillery, Bridges and
Highways, Hydrography, &amp;c. which, <i>special</i> as they are essentially,
in proportion to the sciences particularly taught in them, are better
described, however, by the name of <i>Schools for Public Services</i>, on
account of the immediate utility derived from them by the government.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>Special</i> Schools now in existence, which are to be
kept up, new ones are to be established in the following proportion:</p>
<p>Ten Schools of Jurisprudence. These useful institutions, which have been
abolished during the last ten years, are, by a new organization, to resume the
importance that they had lost long before the revolution. The pupils are to be
examined in a manner more certain for determining their capacity, and better
calculated for securing the degree of confidence to be reposed in those men to
whose knowledge and integrity individuals are sometimes forced to intrust their
character and fortune.</p>
<p>Three new Schools of Medicine, in addition to the three at present in being.
These also are to be newly organized in the most perfect manner.</p>
<p>The mathematical and physical sciences have made too great a progress in
France, their application to the useful arts, to the public service, and to the
general prosperity, has been too direct, says FOURCROY, for it not to be
necessary to diffuse the taste for them, and to open new asylums where the
advantages resulting from them may be extended, and their progress promoted.
There are therefore to be four new <i>Special</i> Schools of Natural History,
Physics, and Chymistry, and also a <i>Special</i> School devoted to
transcendent Mathematics.</p>
<p>The mechanical and chymical arts, so long taught in several universities in
Germany under the name of <i>technology</i>, are to have two <i>Special</i>
Schools, placed in the cities most rich in industry and manufactures. These
schools, generally wished for, are intended to contribute to the national
prosperity by the new methods which they will make known, the new instruments
and processes which they will bring into use, the good models of machines which
they will introduce, in a word, by every means that mechanics and chymistry can
furnish to the arts.</p>
<p>A School of Public Economy, enlightened by Geography and History, is to be
opened for those who may be desirous to investigate the principles of
governments, and the art of ascertaining their respective interests. In this
school it is proposed to unite such an assemblage of knowledge as has not yet
existed in France.</p>
<p>To the three principal schools of the arts dependent on design, which are at
present open, is to be added a fourth, become necessary since those arts bring
back to France the pure taste of the beautiful forms, of which Greece has left
such perfect models.</p>
<p>In each of the observatories now in use is to be a professor of astronomy,
and the art of navigation is expected to derive new succour from these schools,
most of which are placed in the principal sea-ports. A knowledge of the heavens
and the study of the movements of the celestial bodies, which every year
receives very remarkable augmentations from the united efforts of the most
renowned geometricians and the most indefatigable observers, may have a great
influence on the progress of civilization. On which account the French
government is extremely eager to promote the science of astronomy.</p>
<p>The language of neighbouring nations, with whom the French have such
frequent intercourse, is to be taught in several Lyceums, as being a useful
introduction to commerce.</p>
<p>The art of war, of which modern times have given such great examples and
such brilliant lessons, is to have its <i>special</i> school, and this school,
on the plan which it is intended to be established by receiving as soldiers
youths from the Lyceums, will form for the French armies officers equally
skilful in theory as in practice.</p>
<p>This new Military School must not be confounded with the old <i>école
militaire</i>. Independently of its not being destined for a particular class,
which no longer exists in this country, the mode of instruction to be
introduced there will render it totally different from the establishment which
bore the same name.</p>
<p>It is to be composed of five hundred pupils, forming a battalion, and who
are to be accustomed to military duty and discipline; it is to have at least
ten professors, charged to teach all the theoretical, practical, and
administrative parts of the art of war, as well as the history of wars and of
great captains.</p>
<p>Of the five hundred pupils of the Special Military School, two hundred are
to be taken from among the national pupils of the Lyceums, in proportion to
their number in each of those schools, and three hundred from among the
boarders and day-scholars, according to the examination which they must undergo
at the end of their studies. Every year one hundred of the former are to be
admitted, and two hundred of the latter. They are to be maintained two years in
the Special Military School, at the expense of the Republic. These two years
are to be considered as part of their military service.</p>
<p>According to the report made of the behaviour and talents of the pupils of
the Military School, the government is to provide them with appointments in the
army.</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL PUPILS.</p>
<p>There are to be maintained at the expense of the Republic six thousand four
hundred pupils, as boarders in the Lyceums and Special Schools.</p>
<p>Out of these six thousand four hundred boarders, two thousand four hundred
are to be chosen by the government from among the sons of officers and public
functionaries of the judicial, administrative, or municipal order, who shall
have served the Republic with fidelity, and for ten years only from among the
children of citizens belonging to the departments united to France, although
they have neither been military men nor public functionaries.</p>
<p>These two thousand four hundred pupils are to be at least nine years of age,
and able to read and write.</p>
<p>The other four thousand are to be taken from double the number of pupils of
the Secondary Schools, who, according to an examination where their talents are
put in competition, are to be presented to the government.</p>
<p>The pupils, maintained in the Lyceums, are not to remain there more than six
years at the expense of the nation. At the end of their studies, they are to
undergo an examination, after which a fifth of them are to be placed in the
different Special Schools according to their disposition, in order to be
maintained there from two to four years at the expense of the Republic.</p>
<p>The annual cost of all these establishments is estimated at near eight
millions of francs, (<i>circa</i> £336,000 sterling) which exceeds by at least
two millions the amount of the charges of the public instruction for the few
preceding years; but this augmentation, which will only take place by degrees,
and at soonest in eighteen months, appears trifling, compared to the advantages
likely to result from the new system.</p>
<p>Whenever this plan is carried into execution, what hopes may not France
conceive from the youth of the rising generation, who, chosen from among those
inclined to study, will, in all probability, rise to every degree of fame! The
surest pledge of the success of the measure seems to consist in the spirit of
emulation which is to be maintained, not only among the pupils, but even among
the professors in the different schools; for emulation, in the career of
literature, arts and sciences, leads to fame, and never fails to turn to the
benefit of society; whereas jealousy, in the road of ambition and fortune,
produces nothing but hatred and discord.</p>
<p class="bq">"Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,<br />
Is emulation in the learn'd and brave."</p>
<p><a name="let51fr2"></a>So much for the plan.[<a href="#let51f2">2</a>] In
your last letter, you desire that I will afford you some means of appreciating
the essential difference between the old system of education pursued in France,
and the basis on which public instruction is now on the point of being
reorganised and established. You must be sensible that the comparison of the
two modes, were I to enter deeply into the question, would far exceed the
limits of a letter. But, though I have already extended this to a certain
length, I can, in a few more lines, enable you to compare and judge, by
informing you, from the best authority, what has been the spirit which has
dictated the new organization.</p>
<p>There are very few men who know how to confine themselves within just
bounds. Some yield to the mania of innovation, and imagine that they create
only because they destroy and change. Others bend under the yoke of old habits.
Some, solely because they have remained strangers to the sciences, would wish
that youth should be employed only in the study of languages and literature.
Others who, no doubt, forget that every learned man, who aims at a solid
reputation, ought to sacrifice to the Muses, before he penetrates into the
sanctuary of science, would wish education to be confined to the study of the
exact sciences, and that youth should be occupied on things, before they are
acquainted with words.</p>
<p>For the sole reason that the old system of instruction bore too exclusively
on the study of the learned languages, it was to be feared that the new one,
through a contrary excess, would proscribe the Greek and Latin. The study of
these two languages, as FOURCROY has observed to me, is not merely useful to
those who wish to acquire a thorough knowledge of the French, which has
borrowed from them no small number of words, but it is only from the perusal of
the great writers of antiquity, on whom the best among the moderns have formed
themselves, that we can imbibe the sentiment of the beautiful, the taste, and
the rectitude of mind equally necessary, whether we feel ourselves attracted
towards eloquence or poetry, or raise ourselves to the highest conceptions of
the physical or mathematical sciences.</p>
<p>At no time can the instruction given to a youth be otherwise considered than
as a preparatory mean, whose object is to anticipate his taste and disposition,
and enable him to enter with more firmness into the career which he is intended
to follow.</p>
<p>From an attentive perusal of the plan, of which I have traced you the
leading features, you will be convinced that the study of the sciences will
gain by the new system, without that of literature being in danger of losing.
The number of professors is increased, and yet the period of education is not
prolonged. A pupil will always be at liberty to apply himself more intensely to
the branch to which he is impelled by his particular inclination. He may
confine himself to one course of lectures, or attend to several, according to
his intellectual means. He will not be compelled to stop in his career, merely
because the pupils of his class do not advance. In short, neither limits nor
check have been put to the progress that may be made by talent.</p>
<p>I here give you only a principal idea, but the application of it, improved
by your sagacity and knowledge, will be sufficient to answer all the objections
which may be started against the new plan of instruction, and which, when
carefully investigated, may be reduced to a single one; namely, that literature
is sacrificed to the sciences.</p>

<h2><a name="let52">LETTER LII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 18, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Of all the private lodgings in Paris, none certainly can be more convenient
for the residence of a single man than those of</p>
<p class="center">MILLINERS.</p>
<p>I have already said that such is the profession of my landlady. Whenever I
am disposed for a little lively chitchat, I have only to step to the next door
but one into her <i>magazin de modes</i>, where, like a favourite courtier,
under the old <i>régime</i>, I have both <i>les grandes et les petites
entrées</i>, or, in plain English, I may either introduce myself by the public
front entrance, or slip in by the private back-door.</p>
<p>Here, twenty damsels are employed in making up head-dresses which are hourly
produced and varied by fashion. Closely confined to the counter, with a needle
in their hand, they are continually throwing their eyes towards the street. Not
a passenger escapes their notice. The place the nearest to the window is in the
greatest request, as being most favourable for catching the transient homages
of the crowds of men continually passing and repassing. It is generally
occupied by the beauty of the <i>magazin</i> or warehouse; for it would be
resented as an almost unpardonable offence to term this emporium of taste a
<i>boutique</i> or shop.</p>
<p>Before each of them is a block, on which they form and adjust the gallant
trophy destined to heighten the loveliness of some ambitious fair who has set
her heart on surpassing all her rivals at an approaching ball. Montesquieu
observes, in his Persian letters, that "if a lady has taken it into her head to
appear at an assembly in a particular dress, from that moment fifty persons of
the working class must no longer sleep, or have time to eat and drink. She
commands, and is obeyed more expeditiously than the king of Persia, because
interest has greater sway than the most powerful monarch on earth."</p>
<p>In the morning, some of these damsels wait on the ladies with bandboxes of
millinery. Obliged by their profession to adorn the heads of other women, they
must stifle the secret jealousy of their sex, and contribute to set off the
person of those who not unfrequently treat them with hauteur. However, they are
now and then amply revenged: sometimes the proud rich lady is eclipsed by the
humble little milliner. The unadorned beauty of the latter destroys the made up
charms of the coquette: 'tis the triumph of nature over art.</p>
<p>If, perchance, the lover drops in, fatal consequences ensue. His belle
cannot but lose by the comparison: her complexion appears still more artificial
beside the natural bloom of the youthful <i>marchande</i>. In a word, the
silent admirer all at once becomes faithless.</p>
<p>Many a young Parisian milliner has made a jump from behind the counter into
a fashionable carriage, even into that of an English peer. Strange revolution
of fortune! In the course of a few days, she returns to the same shop to make
purchases, holding high her head; and exulting in her success. Her former
mistress, sacrificing her rage to her interest, assumes a forced complaisance;
while her once-dear companions are ready to burst with envy.</p>
<p>Millinery here constitutes a very extensive branch of trade. Nothing short
of the creative genius of the French could contrive to give, again and again, a
new form to things the most common. In vain do females of other countries
attempt to vie with them; in articles of tasteful fancy they still remain
unrivaled.</p>
<p>From Paris, these studious mistresses of invention give laws to the polished
world. After passing to London, Berlin, Hamburg, and Vienna, their models of
fashion are disseminated all over Europe. These models alike travel to the
banks of the Neva and the shores of the Propontis. At Constantinople, they find
their way into the seraglio of the Grand Signior; while, at Petersburg, they
are servilely copied to grace the Empress of Russia. Thus, the fold given to a
piece of muslin or velvet, the form impressed on a ribband, by the hand of an
ingenious French milliner, is repeated among all nations.</p>
<p>A fashion here does not last a week, before it is succeeded by another
novelty; for a French woman of <i>bon ton</i>, instead of wearing what is
commonly worn by others, always aims at appearing in something new. It is
unfortunately too true, that the changeableness of taste and inconstancy of
fashion in France furnish an aliment to the luxury of other countries; but the
principle of this communication is in the luxury of this gay and volatile
people.</p>
<p>You reproach me with being silent respecting the <i>bals masqués</i> or
masquerades, mentioned in my enumeration of the amusements of Paris. The fact
is that a description of them will scarcely furnish matter for a few lines,
still less a subject for a letter. However, in compliance with custom, I have
been more than once to the</p>
<p class="center">BAL DE L'OPÉRA.</p>
<p>This is a masquerade frequently given in the winter, at the theatre of the
grand French opera, where the pit is covered over, as that is of our
opera-house in the Haymarket. From the powerful draught of air, which, coming
from behind the scenes, may well be termed <i>vent de coulisse</i>, the room is
as cold as the season.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, masquerades were strictly forbidden, and this
prohibition continued under the directorial government. It is only since
BONAPARTE'S accession to the post of Chief Magistrate, that the Parisians have
been indulged with the liberty of wearing disguises during the carnival.</p>
<p>Of all the amusements in Paris, I have ever thought this the most tiresome
and insipid. But it is the same at the <i>Bal de l'Opéra</i> as at
<i>Frascati</i>, <i>Longchamp</i>, and other points of attraction here; every
one is soon tired of them, and yet every one flocks thither. In fact, what can
well be more tiresome than a place where you find persons masked, without wit
or humour? Though, according to the old French saying, "<i>I faut avoir bien
peu d'esprit pour ne pas en avoir sous le masque?</i>"</p>
<p>The men, who at a masquerade here generally go unmasked, think it not worth
while to be even complaisant to the women, who are elbowed, squeezed, and
carried by the tide from one end of the room to the other, before they are well
aware of it. Dominos are the general dress. The music is excellent; but it is
not the fashion to dance; and <i>les femmes de bonne compagnie</i>, that is,
well-bred women, are condemned to content themselves with the dust they inhale;
for they dare not quit their mask to take any refreshment. But, notwithstanding
these inconveniences, it is here reckoned a fine thing to have been at a <i>bal
masqué</i> when the crowd was great, and the pressure violent; as the more the
ladies have shared in it, the more they congratulate themselves on the
occasion.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the <i>grand ton</i> was for gentlemen to go to the
<i>Bal de l'Opéra</i> in a full-dress suit of black, and unmasked. Swords were
here prohibited, as at Bath. This etiquette of dress, however, rendered not the
company more select.</p>
<p>I remember well that at a masked ball at the Parisian opera, in the year
1785, the very first beau I recognized in the room, parading in a <i>habit de
cour</i>, was my own <i>perruquier</i>. As at present, the amusement of the
women then consisted in teazing the men; and those who had a disposition for
intrigue, gave full scope to the impulse of their nature. The <i>fille
entretenue</i>, the <i>duchesse</i>, and the <i>bourgeoise</i>, disguised under
a similar domino, were not always distinguishable; and I have heard of a
certain French marquis, who was here laid under heavy contribution for the
momentary gratification of his caprice, though the object of it proved to be no
other than his own <i>cara sposa</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="let53">LETTER LIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 19, 1802.</i></p>
<p>When you expressed your impatience to be informed of the dramatic amusements
in Paris, I promised to satisfy you as soon as I was able; for I knew that you
would not be contented with a superficial examination. Therefore, in reviewing
the principal scenic establishments, I shall, as I have done before, exert my
endeavours not only to make you acquainted with the <i>best</i> performers in
every department, but also with the <i>best</i> stock-pieces, in order that, by
casting your eye on the <i>Affiches des Spectacles</i>, when you visit this
capital, you may at once form a judgment of the quality and quantity of the
entertainment you are likely to enjoy at the representation of a particular
piece, in which certain performers make their appearance. Since the revolution,
the custom of printing the names of the actors and dancers in each piece, has
been introduced. Formerly, amateurs often paid their money only to experience a
disappointment; for, instead of seeing the hero or heroine that excited their
curiosity, they had a bad duplicate, or, as the French term it, a
<i>double</i>, imposed on them, more frequently through caprice than any other
motive. This is now obviated; and, except in cases of sudden and unforeseen
indisposition, you may be certain of seeing the best performers whenever their
name is announced.</p>
<p>In speaking of the theatres, the pieces represented, and the merits of the
performers, I cannot be supposed to be actuated by any prejudice or partiality
whatever. I have, it is true, been favoured with the oral criticism of a man of
taste, who, as a very old acquaintance, has generally accompanied me to the
different <i>spectacles</i>; but still I have never adopted his sentiments,
unless the truth of them had been confirmed by my own observation. From him I
have been favoured with a communication of such circumstances respecting them
as occurred during the revolution, when I was absent from Paris. You may
therefore confidently rely on the candour and impartiality of my general sketch
of the theatres; and if the stage be considered as a mirror which reflects the
public mind, you will thence be enabled to appreciate the taste of the
Parisians. Without forgetting that</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>La critique est aisée, mais l'art est difficile</i>,"</p>
<p>I shall indulge the hope that you will be persuaded that truth alone has
guided my pen in this attempt to trace the attractions of the</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE FRANÇAIS DE LA RÉPUBLIQUE.</p>
<p>The house, now occupied by the performers of this theatre, was built at the
beginning of the revolution by the late duke of Orleans, who, according to the
opinion of those best acquainted with his schemes of profit, intended it for
the representation of the grand French opera, for which, nevertheless, it is
not sufficiently spacious.</p>
<p>It stands adjoining to the south-west angle of the <i>Palais du
Tribunat</i>, with its front entrance in the <i>Rue de la Loi</i>. Its façade
presents a row of twelve Doric columns, surmounted by as many Corinthian
pilasters, crowned by their entablature. On the first story is an exterior
gallery; ornamented by an iron balustrade, which runs the whole length of the
façade, and communicates with the lobby. On the north side, and at the back of
the theatre, on the ground-floor, are several covered galleries, bordered by
shops, which communicate with the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i> and the <i>Palais du
Tribunat</i>.</p>
<p>The vestibule, where four stair-cases terminate, is of an elliptic form,
surrounded by three rows of Doric pillars. Above the vestibule, which is on the
ground-floor, are the pit and lobby. The inside of the house, which is
immoderately lofty, presents seven tiers of boxes, and, in the circumference,
six Corinthian pillars. The ornaments, numerously scattered, are in relief. At
a certain elevation, the plan of the house is changed by a recess made facing
the stage. Two angels, above the stage-boxes, shock the eye by their enormous
size. <a name="let53fr1"></a>The boxes to the number of two hundred and
twenty-two, are said to contain thirteen hundred persons; and the pit,
including the <i>orchestre</i>,[<a href="#let53f1">1</a>] seven hundred and
twenty-four, making in all two thousand and twenty persons. The construction of
this house is remarkable for iron only being employed in lieu of wood. The
architect was LOUIS.</p>
<p>This theatre, which was begun in 1787, was finished in 1790, when, all
privileges having been done away, it was first opened by a company of French
comedians, who played tragedy and comedy. It then took the name of <i>Théâtre
Français de la Rue de Richelieu</i>, which street was afterwards and is now
called <i>Rue de la Loi</i>. Being opened at the commencement of the
revolution, it naturally adopted its principles; and, when the National
Convention had proclaimed the Republic, it assumed the pompous name of
<i>Théâtre de la République</i>. The greater part of the actors who performed
here, rendered themselves remarkable for their <i>revolutionary</i> ardour,
and, during the reign of terror, it became a privileged theatre.</p>
<p>The <i>Comédie Française</i> in the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, which, in
its interior, presented the handsomest playhouse in Paris, was called
<i>l'Odéon</i> a few years ago, and, since then, has been reduced by fire to a
mere shell, the walls only being left standing. In 1789, this theatre appeared
to follow the torrent of the revolution, and changed its name for that of
<i>Théâtre de la Nation</i>. Nevertheless, the actors did not, on that account,
relinquish the title of <i>Comédiens ordinaires du Roi</i>. Shortly after, they
even became, in general, the declared partisans of the old <i>régime</i>, or at
least of the court. Their house was frequently an <i>arena</i> where the two
parties came to blows, particularly on the occasion of the tragedy of
<i>Charles Neuf</i>, by CHÉNIER, and of the comedy of <i>L'Ami des Loix</i>.
The former of these pieces, represented in the first ebullition of the
revolution, was directed against the court; and the comedians refused to bring
it on the stage, at the time of the assemblage of the national guards in Paris,
on the 14th of July, 1790, known by the title of <i>Federation</i>. The latter
was played after the massacres of September 1792, and had been composed with
the laudable view of bringing back the public mind to sentiments of humanity,
justice, and moderation. The maxims which it contained, being diametrically
opposite to those of the plunderers who then reigned, that is, the members of
the <i>commune</i> of Paris, the minority of the National Convention, the
Jacobins, Cordeliers, &amp;c. they interrupted the representation, and, after a
great uproar, the piece was prohibited.</p>
<p>This minority of which I have just spoken, having succeeded in subduing the
majority, nothing now stopped the rage of the revolutionary party. All those
who gave them umbrage were imprisoned, and put to death with the forms of law.
The comedians of the French theatre were thrown into prison; it appears that
they were, both men and women, partly destined for the scaffold, and that if
they escaped, it was through the address of a clerk of one of the Committees of
Public Welfare or of Public Safety, who repeatedly concealed the documents
containing the charges brought against them. <a name="let53fr2"></a>It is said
that the comedians purpose to prove their gratitude, so long delayed, to this
young man, without putting themselves to any expense, by giving for his benefit
an extraordinary representation.[<a href="#let53f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>At length the happy 9th of Thermidor arrived; the prisons were thrown open;
and, as you may well imagine in such a nation as this, the French comedians
were not the last to be set at liberty. However, their theatre was not
immediately restored to them. It was occupied by a sort of bastard
<i>spectacle</i>, with the actors of which they were then obliged to form an
association. This did not last long. The French comedians were received by the
manager of the lyric theatre of the <i>Rue Feydeau</i>, whom they afterwards
ruined. The actors of comedy, properly so called, contrived to expel those of
tragedy, with whom they thought they could dispense; and, shortly, they
themselves, notwithstanding their reputation, were deserted by the public. The
heroes and heroines, with Mademoiselle RAUCOURT at their head, took possession
of the theatre of the <i>Rue de Louvois</i>, and there prospered. But, after
the 18th of Fructidor, (5th of September, 1797) the Directory caused this house
to be shut up: the reason assigned was the representation given here of a
little comedy, of ancient date however, and of no great importance, in which a
knavish valet is called MERLIN, as was the Minister of Justice of that day, who
since became director, not of the theatre, but of the republic. Mademoiselle
RAUCOURT, who was directress of this theatre, returned with her company to the
old theatre of the <i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, which then took the name of
<i>l'Odéon</i>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the theatre of the <i>Rue de Richelieu</i> had perceptibly
declined, after the fall of Robespierre, and the public appeared to have come
to a positive determination to frequent it no longer. The manager of the
<i>Théâtre Feydeau</i>, M. SARGENT, formerly a banker, who was rich, and
enjoyed a good reputation, succeeded in uniting all the actors of the
<i>Comédie Française</i> and those of the <i>Théâtre de la République</i>. This
effected his own ruin. When he had relinquished the management of the
undertaking, the government took it in hand, and definitively organized this
tragic and comic association, to superintend which it appointed a special
commissioner.</p>
<p>The <i>repertoire</i> (or list of pieces which are here played habitually,
or have been acted with applause) is amazingly well furnished, and does
infinite honour to French literature. It may be divided into two parts, the
ancient and the modern. It is the former that deserves the encomium which I
have just bestowed. <a name="let53fr3"></a>In the line of Tragedy, it is
composed of the greater part of the pieces of the four principal pillars of the
temple of the French Melpomene: namely CORNEILLE[<a href="#let53f3">3</a>],
RACINE, CRÉBILLON, and VOLTAIRE, to whom may be added DU BELLOY, as well as of
some detached pieces, such as <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i> by GUIMOND DE LA
TOUCHE, <i>Le Comte de Warwick</i> and <i>Philoctète</i> by LA HARPE. The
modern <i>repertoire</i>, or list of stock-pieces, is formed of the tragedies
of M. M. DUCIS, CHÉNIER, ARNAULT, LEGOUVÉ, and LE MERCIER.</p>
<p>In the line of Comedy, it is also very rich. You know that, at the head of
the French comic authors, stands MOLIÈRE, who, in this country at least, has no
equal, either among the ancients or the moderns. Several of his pieces are
still represented, though they are not numerously attended; as well because
manners are changed, as because the actors are no longer able to perform them.
Next to MOLIÈRE, but at a great interval, comes REGNARD, whom the French
comedians have deserted, for much the same reason: they no longer give any
plays from the pen of this author, who possessed the <i>vis comica</i>, except
<i>Les Folies Amoureuses</i>, a pretty little comedy in three acts. We no
longer hear of his <i>Joueur</i> and his <i>Légataire Universel</i>, which are
<i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>. There are likewise the works of DESTOUCHES, who has
written <i>Le Glorieux, Le Dissipateur</i>, and <i>La Fausse Agnès</i>, which
are always played with applause. <i>Le Méchant</i>, by GRESSET, is a
masterpiece in point of style, and <i>La Métromanie</i>, by PIRON, the best of
French comedies, next to those of MOLIÈRE and REGNARD. Then come the works of
LA CHAUSSÉE, who is the father of the <i>drame</i>, and whose pieces are no
longer represented, though he has composed several, such as <i>La
Gouvernante</i>, <i>L'École des Mères</i>, <i>Le Préjugé à la Mode</i>, which,
notwithstanding, their whining style, are not destitute of merit, and those of
DANCOURT, who has written several little comedies, of a very lively cast, which
are still played, and those of MARIVAUX, whose old metaphysical jargon still
pleases such persons as have their head full of love. I might augment this list
by the name of several other old authors, whose productions have more or less
merit.</p>
<p>The number of modern French comic authors is very limited; for it is not
even worthwhile to speak of a few little comedies in one act, the title of
which the public scarcely remember. According to this calculation, there is but
one single comic author now living. That is COLIN D'HARLEVILLE, who has written
<i>L'Inconstant</i>, <i>Les Châteaux en Espagne</i>, <i>Le Vieux
Célibataire</i>, and <i>Les M&oelig;urs du Jour</i>, which are still
represented. <i>Le Vieux Célibataire</i> is always received with much applause.
In general, the pieces of M. COLIN are cold, but his style is frequently
graceful: he writes in verse; and the whole part of <i>L'Inconstant</i> is very
agreeably written. Indeed, that piece is the best of this author.</p>
<p>FABRE D'EGLANTINE is celebrated as an actor in the revolution (I mean on the
political stage), and as the author who has produced the best piece that has
appeared since <i>La Métromanie</i>. It is the <i>Philinte de Molière</i>,
which, in some measure, forms a sequel to the comedy of the <i>Misanthrope</i>.
Nevertheless, this title is ill chosen; for the character of the
<i>Philinte</i> in the piece of MOLIÈRE, and that of FABRE'S piece scarcely
bear any resemblance. We might rather call it the <i>Égoiste</i>. Although the
comic part of it is weak, the piece is strongly conceived, the fable very well
managed, the style nervous but harsh, and the third act is a
<i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>
<p>Since the death of FABRE, another piece of his has been acted, entitled
<i>Le Précepteur</i>. In this piece are to be recognized both his manner and
his affected philosophical opinions. His object is to vaunt the excellence of
the education recommended by J. J. ROUSSEAU, though the revolution has, in a
great measure, proved the fallacy of the principles which it inculcates. As
these, however, are presented with art, the piece had some success, and still
maintains its ground on the stage. It was played for the first time about two
years ago. The surname of EGLANTINE, which FABRE assumed, arose from his having
won the prize at the Floral games at Toulouse. The prize consisted of an
<i>eglantine</i> or wild rose in gold. Before he became a dramatic author, he
was an actor and a very bad actor. Being nominated member of the National
Convention, he distinguished himself in that assembly, not by oratorical
talents, but by a great deal of villainy. <a name="let53fr4"></a>He did not
think as he acted or spoke. When the
<i>montagnards</i>[<a href="#let53f4">4</a>] or mountaineers, that is, those
monsters who were always thirsting for blood, divided, he appeared for some
time to belong to the party of DANTON, who, however, denied him when they were
both in presence of each other at the bar of the revolutionary tribunal.
<a name="let53fr5"></a>DANTON insisted that he who had been brought to trial
for a just cause, if not a just motive, ought not to be confounded with
stealers of port-folios.[<a href="#let53f5">5</a>] They were both sentenced to
die, and accordingly executed.</p>
<p>Among the comic authors of our age, some people would reckon DUMOUSTIER,
whose person was held in esteem, but whose works are below mediocrity. They are
<i>Le Conciliateur</i>, a comedy in five acts, and <i>Les Femmes</i>, a comedy
in three acts. The latter appears to be the picture of a brothel. They are both
still played, and both have much vogue, which announces the total decline of
the art.</p>
<p>There is a third species of dramatic composition, proscribed by the rules of
good taste, and which is neither tragedy nor comedy, but participates of both.
It is here termed <i>drame</i>. Although LA CHAUSSÉE is the father of this
tragi-comic species of writing, he had not, however, written any <i>tragédies
bourgeoises</i>, and the French declare that we have communicated to them this
contagion; for their first <i>drame</i>, <i>Beverley, ou le Joueur Anglais</i>
is a translation in verse from the piece of that name of our theatre.
<a name="let53fr6"></a>The celebrated LEKAIN[<a href="#let53f6">6</a>] opposed
its being acted, and affirmed with reason that this mixture of the two species
of drama hurt them both. MOLÉ, who was fond of applause easily obtained, was
the protector of the piece, and played the part of <i>Beverley</i> with
success; but this <i>drame</i> is no longer performed on the Parisian stage.
Next to this, comes <i>Le Père de Famille</i>, by DIDEROT. It is a long sermon.
However, it presents characters well drawn. <a name="let53fr7"></a>This species
of composition is so easy that the number of <i>drames</i> is considerable; but
scarcely any of them are now performed, except <i>Eugénie</i> and <i>La Mère
Coupable</i>, by BEAUMARCHAIS,[<a href="#let53f7">7</a>] which are frequently
represented. I shall not finish this article without reminding you that MERCIER
has written so many <i>drames</i> that he has been called <i>Le Dramaturge</i>.
All his are become the prey of the little theatres and the aliment of the
provincial departments. This circumstance alone would suffice to prove the
mediocrity of the <i>drame</i>. MONVEL, of whom I shall soon have occasion to
speak, would well deserve the same title.</p>

<h2><a name="let54">LETTER LIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 20, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Let us now examine the merits of the principal performers belonging to the
<i>Théâtre Français</i>.</p>
<h3>TRAGEDY.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Noble Fathers, or characters of Kings</i>.<br />
VANHOVE, MONVEL, ST. PRIX, and NAUDET.</p>
<p>VANHOVE. This king of the <i>Théâtre Français</i> neither has majesty nor
nobleness of manner. His countenance is mean, and his make common. His
monotonous and heavy utterance is sometimes intermingled with yelping sounds.
He possesses no sensibility, and substitutes noise for expression. His
mediocrity caused him to be received at the old <i>Comédie Française</i>; for
the first or principal actors of that theatre were rather fond of receiving
persons of weak talents, merely that they might be set off. He <i>doubled</i>
BRIZARD, whom nature had endowed with the happiest gifts for tragedy.</p>
<p>VANHOVE was the first player ever called for by a Parisian audience after
the representation, in order to express to him their satisfaction. However, it
may be proper to observe that, in such cases, it is always some friend of the
author who takes the lead. VANHOVE no longer obtains this favour at present,
and is seldom applauded. He also plays the parts of fathers in comedy.</p>
<p>MONVEL. This actor is not near so old as VANHOVE; but the decay of his
person is such that, when he plays, he seems a skeleton bestirring itself, or
that is set in motion. It is a misfortune for him that his physical means
betray his talents. MONVEL is a man of genius. Thus gifted, it is not
astonishing that he has a just diction, and is not deficient in intelligence.
Some persons doubt whether he has real sensibility; but he at least presents
the appearance of it. He, in some measure, breaks his voice, and vents mournful
accents which produce much effect. With a constitution extremely weak, it is
impossible that he should perform characters which require energy and pride.
<a name="let54fr1"></a>He therefore confines himself to those in which the
pathetic is predominant, or which do not imperiously demand great efforts, such
as <i>Auguste</i> in <i>Cinna</i>, <i>Burrhus</i> in <i>Britannicus</i>,
<i>Brutus</i> in the tragedy of that name (now no longer played),
<i>Lusignan</i> in <i>Zaire</i>, <i>Zopire</i> in <i>Mahomet</i>,
<i>Fénélon</i>[<a href="#let54f1">1</a>] and <i>l'Abbé de l'Epée</i> in the two
pieces of that name. His stock of characters then is by no means extensive. We
may also add to it the part of <i>Ésope à la cour</i>, in the comedy of that
name by BOURSAULT, which he plays or recites in great perfection, because it is
composed of fables only. MONVEL delivers them with neatness and simplicity.
<a name="let54fr2"></a>For this part he has no equal in
France.[<a href="#let54f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>MONVEL is author as well as actor. He has composed several comic operas and
<i>drames</i>; and his pieces, without being good, have always obtained great
applause. His <i>drames</i> are <i>l'Amant Bourru</i>, <i>Clémentine et
Désormes</i>, <i>Les Amours de Bayard</i>, <i>Les Victimes Cloitrées</i>,
&amp;c. You will find in them forced situations, but set off by sentiment. He
is lavish of stage-effect and that always pleases the multitude. <i>L'Amant
Bourru</i> has alone remained as a stock-piece.</p>
<p>By his zeal for the revolution, he alienated from him a great part of the
public. When every principle of religion was trodden under foot, and, under the
name of festivals of reason or of the goddess of reason, orgies of the most
scandalous nature were celebrated in the churches, MONVEL ascended the pulpit
of the parish of St. Roch, and preached <i>atheism</i> before an immense
congregation. Shortly after, Robespierre caused the National Convention to
proclaim the following declaration: "<i>The French people acknowledge the
Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul.</i>"
<a name="let54fr3"></a>MONVEL trembled; and it is probable that, had not that
sanguinary tyrant been overthrown, the atheistical preacher would have
descended from the pulpit only to ascend the
scaffold.[<a href="#let54f3">3</a>]</p>
<p>ST. PRIX. He has no fixed employment. Sometimes he plays the parts of kings,
sometimes those of lovers; but excels in none. He would be a very handsome man,
were it possible to be so with a face void of expression. Nature has given him
a strong but hollow voice; and he recites so coldly, that he makes the public
yawn, and seems sometimes to yawn himself. When he means to display warmth, he
screams and fatigues the ear without mercy.</p>
<p>NAUDET. This man, who is great only in stature, quitted the rank of serjeant
in the <i>Gardes Françaises</i> to become a bad player. In the character of
kings, he scarcely now appears but to personate tyrants. He is very cold, and
speaks through his nose like a Capuchin friar, which has gained him the
appellation of the Reverend Father NAUDET.</p>
<p class="center"><i>First parts or principal lovers, in Tragedy</i>.<br />
TALMA, and LAFOND.</p>
<p><a name="let54fr4"></a>TALMA. The great reputation which circumstances and
his friends[<a href="#let54f4">4</a>] have given to this actor has, probably,
rendered him celebrated in England. His stature and his voice (which, in
theatrical language, is called <i>organ</i>), should seem to qualify him for
the parts of <i>jeunes premiers</i> only, of which I shall say more hereafter.
Accordingly he made his <i>début</i> in that line about fifteen or sixteen
years ago. Without being brilliant, his first appearances were successful, and
he was received on trial. <a name="let54fr5"></a>He soon caused himself to be
remarked by the correctness of his dress.[<a href="#let54f5">5</a>]
<a name="let54fr6"></a>But what fixed attention on TALMA, was the part of
<i>Charles Neuf</i>, which he plays in the tragedy of that
name.[<a href="#let54f6">6</a>] In the riots to which this piece gave rise in
1790, TALMA figured as a patriot. Having fallen out with the comedians who had
behaved ill to him, and no longer placed him in any other parts than those of
confidants, he was engaged at the new <i>Théâtre Français</i> of the <i>Rue de
Richelieu</i>, where it was proposed to him to perform the characters which
pleased him best, that is, the best in each piece. Thus he was seen alternately
personating young princes, heroes, and tyrants.</p>
<p>TALMA is now reduced to those of the old stock. The characters he at present
represents are <i>Cinna</i> in the tragedy of that name by CORNEILLE,
<i>Oreste</i> in the <i>Andromaque</i> of RACINE, <i>Néron</i> in the
<i>Britannicus</i> of the same, <i>&OElig;dipe</i> in the tragedy of that name
by VOLTAIRE, and <i>Faïel</i> in <i>Gabrielle du Vergy</i> by DU BELLOY,
<i>Oreste</i> in <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i> by GUIMOND DE LA TOUCHE, and
<i>Ægisthe</i> in the <i>Agamemnon</i> of LE MERCIER. TALMA also plays many
other parts, but, in these, he makes no great figure. He had a great aversion
to old pieces, and as long as he preserved his sway at the theatre, very few,
if any were performed. In fact, there are many in which he is below
mediocrity.</p>
<p>You will certainly expect that I should tell you what constitutes the talent
of this performer. He is small in stature, thin in person, and rather ill-made;
his arms and legs being bowed, which he takes care to conceal by the fulness of
his garments. He has a fine eye, and his features are regular, but too delicate
for the perspective of the theatre. <a name="let54fr7"></a>He has long since
adopted the antique head-dress,[<a href="#let54f7">7</a>] and has contributed
to bring it into fashion. He distinguished himself formerly in Paris by wearing
clothes of a strange form. As an actor, he has no nobleness of manner, and not
unfrequently his gestures are aukward. His deportment is always ungraceful,
though he often endeavours to imitate the posture of the antique statues; but
even then he presents only a caricature. His countenance has little or no
expression, except in moments of rage or terror. In pourtraying the latter
sentiment, all the faculties of his soul appear absorbed; yet, though his
distraction seems complete, there is a sort of silliness blended with his
stupor, which certain persons take for truth, and which is much more
perceptible in the rest of his characters. In rage, he is a tiger mangling his
prey, and sometimes you might believe that you heard that animal drawing his
breath. TALMA has never expressed well a tender, generous, or noble sentiment.
His soul is neither to be softened nor elevated; and, to produce effect, he
must be in a terror or in a rage; but then he makes a great impression on the
majority of the public. His utterance is slow, minced, and split into
syllables. His voice is hollow; but, in moments of rage, it is strong, yet
without being of a considerable volume. He is generally reproached with being
deficient in sensibility: I think, however, that, by dint of labour, he might
paint feeling; for I have heard him render delicate passages happily enough. He
is accused here of having adopted the English style of acting, though, as far
as my opinion goes, with little or no foundation. Be this as it may, he passed
the early part of his youth in London, where his father resides, and follows
the profession of a dentist. The son may now be about thirty-eight years of
age.</p>
<p>TALMA preserves the reputation of being a zealous partisan of the
revolution; but I am confidently assured that he never injured any one, and
held in horror the assassinations which have left an indelible stain on that
event. He was intimately connected with the deputies, styled <i>Girondists</i>
or <i>Brisotins</i>, who perished on the scaffold, after their party was
overcome, on the 31st of May, 1793, by that of the ferocious mountaineers. The
latter warmly reproached TALMA with having, in the year 1792, after the retreat
of the Prussians, given a <i>fête</i> or grand supper to the famous DUMOURIEZ,
with whom they were beginning to fall out, and whom they accused of treason for
not having taken the king of Prussia prisoner. The hideous MARAT, I am told,
went to call on that general at TALMA'S, where the company received him very
cavalierly, and when he was gone, DUGAZON the actor, hot-headed revolutionist
as he was, by way of pleasantry, pretended to purify the room by burning sugar
in a chaffing-dish. All this amounted to more than was necessary for being
condemned by the revolutionary tribunal; and TALMA, being detested by
ROBESPIERRE, would, in all probability, have been delivered over to that
tribunal, but for the protection of DAVID, the celebrated painter, who was
concerting with him about changing the form of dress of the French people.
During all the reign of terror, TALMA and his wife were in continual fear of
the scaffold.</p>
<p>LAFOND. TALMA reigned, and was in possession of the first cast of parts. Of
these, he played whatever suited him, and rejected what he disliked, when about
a year ago, there appeared in the same line a young actor of a rather tall and
well-proportioned stature, and whom Nature had, besides, gifted with an
agreeable countenance and a tolerably good voice. He had played in the
provincial theatres; but, in order to overcome every obstacle which might be
opposed to his <i>début</i>, he became a pupil of DUGAZON, an actor of comedy,
and what is more singular, of one more frequently a buffoon than a comedian.
The latter, however, is said to possess a knowledge of the style of playing of
the actors who, thirty years ago, graced the French stage, and consequently may
be capable of giving good advice.</p>
<p>By means of this powerful protection, LAFOND got the better of every
difficulty. This actor made his first appearance in the character of
<i>Achille</i> in the tragedy of <i>Iphigénie en Aulide</i> by RACINE. He was
not the Achilles of Homer, nor even that of the piece, or at best he
represented him in miniature. However, his diction generally just, his acting,
some grace, and, above all, the fatigue and <i>ennui</i> which TALMA impressed
on many of the spectators, procured this rival a decisive success. As is
customary in such cases, the newspapers were divided in opinion. The majority
declared for LAFOND, and none of the opposite side spoke unfavourably of him.
It was not so with TALMA. Some judged him harshly, calling him a detestable
actor, while others bestowed on him the epithet of <i>sublime</i>, which, at
the present day, has scarcely any signification; so much is it lavished on the
most indifferent performers. This instance proves the fact; for if TALMA has
reached the <i>sublime</i>, it is <i>le sublime de la Halle</i>.</p>
<p>These two rivals might live in peace; the parts which suit the one, being
absolutely unfit for the talents of the other. TALMA requires only concentered
rage, sentiments of hatred and vengeance, which certainly belong to tragedy,
but which ought not to be expressed as if they came from the mouth of a low
fellow, unworthy of figuring in an action of this kind; and LAFOND is little
qualified for any other than graceful parts, bordering on knight-errantry or
romance. His best character is <i>Achille</i>. I have also seen him perform, if
not in a manner truly tragic, at least highly satisfactory, <i>Rodrigue</i> in
<i>Le Cid</i> of CORNEILLE, and the part of <i>Tancrède</i> in VOLTAIRE'S
tragedy of that name. LAFOND obtains the preference over TALMA in the character
of <i>Orosmane</i> in the tragedy of <i>Zaïre</i>; a character which is the
touchstone of an actor. Not that he excels in it. He has not a marked
countenance, the dignity, the tone of authority, the energy, and the extreme
sensibility which characterize this part. He is not the Sultan who commands. He
is, if you please, a young <i>commis</i> very amorous, a little jealous, who
gets angry, and becomes good-humoured again; but at least he is not a ferocious
being, as TALMA represents <i>Orosmane</i>, in moments of rage and passion, or
an unfeeling one in those which require sensibility.</p>
<p>LAFOND is reproached sometimes with a bombastic and inflated tone. Feeling
that he is deficient in the necessary powers, he swells his voice, which is
prejudicial to truth, and without truth, there is no theatrical illusion.
Nature had intended him for the parts of young lovers, of which I shall
presently speak. His features are too delicate, his countenance not
sufficiently flexible, and his person bespeaks too little of the hero, for
great characters. But when he first appeared, there was a vacancy in this cast
of parts, and none in the other.</p>
<p class="center">Jeunes Premiers, <i>or parts of young Lovers</i>.<br />
ST. FAL, DAMAS, and DUPONT.</p>
<p>ST. FAL. This performer, who is upwards of forty-five, has never had an
exterior sufficiently striking to turn the brain of young princesses. Every
thing in his person is common, and his acting is really grotesque. However, not
long since he frequently obtained applause by a great affectation of
sensibility and a stage-trick, which consists in uttering loud, harsh, and
hoarse sounds after others faint and scarcely articulated. He has, besides, but
a trivial or burlesque delivery, and no dignity, no grace in his deportment or
gestures.</p>
<p>DAMAS. He is much younger than ST. FAL, but his gait and carriage are
vulgar. He is not deficient in warmth; but all this is spoiled by a manner the
most common. He first played at the theatres on the <i>Boulevard</i>, and will
never be able to forget the lessons he imbibed in that school. It is with him
as with the rabbits of which BOILEAU makes mention, in one of his Satires where
he describes a bad dinner,</p>
<p class="bq">"-------- et qui, nés dans Paris,<br />
Sentaient encore le chou dont ils furent nourris."</p>
<p>The <i>drame</i> is the style in which DAMAS best succeeds. There is one in
particular, <i>Le Lovelace Français</i>, where he personates an upholsterer of
the <i>Rue St. Antoine</i>, who has just been cornuted by the young Duke of
Richelieu. This part he performs with much truth, and <i>avec rondeur</i>, as
the critics here express it, to signify plain-dealing. But DAMAS is no less
ignoble in comedy than in tragedy.</p>
<p>DUPONT. This young actor, who is of a very delicate constitution, has never
had what we call great powers on the stage; and a complaint in his tongue has
occasioned a great difficulty in his articulation. Without having a noble air,
he has something distinguishing in his manner. His delivery is correct; but the
defect of which I have spoken has rendered him disagreeable to the public, who
manifest it to him rather rudely, though he has sometimes snatched from them
great applause.</p>
<p>After all the actors I have mentioned, come the confidants, a dull and
stupid set, of whom one only deserves mention, not as an actor, but as an
author. This is DUVAL. He has written that pretty comic opera, entitled <i>Le
Prisonnier</i>, as well as <i>Maison à vendre</i>, and several <i>drames</i>,
among which we must not forget <i>Le Lovelace Français, ou la Jeunesse du Duc
de Richelieu</i>, the piece before-mentioned.</p>
<p class="right"><i>January 20, in continuation</i>.</p>
<p>Next follow the daughters of Melpomene, or those heroines who make the most
conspicuous figure in Tragedy.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Characters of Queens</i>.<br />
Mesdames RAUCOURT and VESTRIS.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle RAUCOURT. Never did <i>début</i> make more noise than that of
this actress, who appeared for the first time on the French stage about thirty
years ago, and might then be sixteen or seventeen years of age. She was a pupil
of Mademoiselle CLAIRON, who had a numerous party, composed of Encyclopædists,
French academicians, and almost all the literati of Paris. The zeal of her
friends, the youth, tall stature, and person of the <i>débutante</i> supplied
the place of talent; and her instructress has recorded in her memoirs that all
her labour was lost. The success, however, of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT was such,
that there were, it is said, several persons squeezed to death at the door of
the playhouse. What increased enthusiasm in favour of the young actress was,
that a reputation for virtue was granted to her as great and as justly merited
as that for talent. Her father declared in the public lobby that he would blow
out her brains if he suspected her of having the smallest intrigue. He kept not
his word. Besides, it is well known that his daughter always took care to
conduct herself in such a manner as to set the foresight even of jealousy at
defiance. Her <i>penchant</i> not leaving her the resource to which women of
her profession generally recur, and her expenses being considerable, her debts
increased; and to avoid the pursuit of her creditors she took refuge in Germany
with her tender friend, Mademoiselle SOUK, who has since been mistress to the
late king of Prussia. They both travelled over that country, and a thousand
reports are circulated to their shame; but the most disgraceful of these are
said to be unfounded. The protection of the queen of France, who paid her debts
repeatedly, at length restored her to the <i>Comédie Française</i>. Such
inconsiderate conduct did no small injury to that unfortunate princess, whom I
mention with concern on such an occasion.</p>
<p>The stature of Mademoiselle RAUCOURT is colossal, and when she presents
herself, she has a very imposing look. Her face, however, is not so noble; she
has small eyes, and her features have not that flexibility necessary for
expressing the movements of the passions. Her voice was formerly very full in
the <i>medium</i> of level-speaking; but it seemed like that of a man. When you
heard it for the first time, you thought that, in impassioned sentences, she
was going to thunder; but, on the contrary, she assumed a very extensive
<i>falsetto</i>, which formed the most singular contrast with the dull sounds
that had preceded it. That defect, perhaps, is somewhat less striking at the
present day; but the voice of this actress is become hoarse, like that of
persons who make a frequent use of strong liquors. The delivery of Mademoiselle
RAUCOURT is, in general, just and correct; for she is allowed to have
understanding; yet, as she neither has warmth nor sensibility, she produces
scarcely any effect. Plaudits most frequently burst forth when she appears;
but, though these are obtained, she never touches the feelings of the
spectator, she never reaches his heart, even in the parts, where she has had
the most vogue. That of <i>Médée</i>, in which she has begun to reestablish her
declining reputation, was neither better felt nor better expressed. She was
indebted for the success she obtained in it only to the magician's robe, to the
wand, and to a stage-trick which consists in stooping and then raising herself
to the utmost height at the moment when she apostrophizes the sun. In the scene
of Medea with her children, a heart-rending and terrible scene, there was
nothing but dryness and a total absence of every maternal feeling.</p>
<p>The characters of queens, which Mademoiselle RAUCOURT performs, are the
first cast of parts at the theatre. It consists of those of mothers and a few
parts of enraged or impassioned lovers. In the works of CORNEILLE, the
principal ones are <i>Cléopatre</i> in <i>Rodogune</i>, and <i>Cornélie</i> in
the <i>Mort de Pompée</i>. In RACINE'S, the parts of <i>Athalie</i> and of
<i>Phèdre</i> in the tragedies of the same name, of <i>Agrippine</i> in
<i>Britannicus</i>, of <i>Clitemnestre</i> in <i>Iphigénie en Aulide</i>, and
of <i>Roxane</i> in <i>Bajazet</i>. In VOLTAIRE'S, those of <i>Mérope</i> and
<i>Sémiramis</i>; and, lastly, that of <i>Médée</i> in the tragedy by
LONGEPIERRE.</p>
<p>Like all the performers belonging to the <i>Théâtre Français</i>,
Mademoiselle RAUCOURT was imprisoned during the reign of terror. The patriots
of that day bore her much ill-will, and it is asserted that Robespierre had a
strong desire to send her to the guillotine. When she reappeared on the stage,
the public compensated her sufferings, and to this circumstance she owes the
rather equivocal reputation she has since enjoyed.</p>
<p>Madame VESTRIS. Although she has been a very long time on the Parisian
stage, this actress is celebrated only from the famous quarrel she had twenty
years ago with Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder. <a name="let54fr8"></a>Through
the powerful protection of the Marshal de DURAS,[<a href="#let54f8">8</a>] her
lover, she prevailed over her formidable rival, who, however, had on her side
the public, and the sublimity of her talent. This quarrel arose from Madame
VESTRIS wishing to wrest from Mademoiselle SAINVAL the parts for which she was
engaged. A memoir, written by an indiscreet friend, in favour of the latter,
which she scorned to disavow, and in which the court was not spared, caused her
to be banished from the capital by a <i>lettre de cachet</i>. The public,
informed of her exile, called loudly for Mademoiselle SAINVAL. No attention was
paid to this by the higher powers, and the guard at the theatre was tripled, in
order to insure to Madame VESTRIS the possibility of performing her part.
Nevertheless, whenever she made her appearance, the public lavished on her
hisses, groans, and imprecations. All this she braved with an effrontery, which
occasioned them to be redoubled. But, as all commotions subside in time, Madame
VESTRIS remained mistress of the stage; while Mademoiselle SAINVAL travelled
over the provinces, where the injustice of the court towards her caused no less
regret than the superiority of her talent excited admiration.</p>
<p>Madame VESTRIS was rather handsome, and this explains the whole mystery. She
had, above all, a most beautiful arm, and paid no small attention to her
toilet. She delivers her parts with tolerable correctness, but her tone is
heavy and common. The little warmth with which she animates her characters, is
the production of an effort; for she neither possesses energy nor feeling. Her
gestures correspond with her acting, and she has no dignity in her deportment.
She seldom appears on the stage at present, which saves her from the
mortification of being hissed. She is now old, and the political opinion of
those who frequent most the theatres rouses them against her.</p>
<p>Although the court had really committed itself to favour her, Madame VESTRIS
was the first to betray her noble patrons. At the period of the revolution, she
quitted the old <i>Comédie Française</i>, taking with her DUGAZON, her father,
and TALMA, and founded the present theatre, styled <i>Théâtre de la
République</i>. She was also followed by several authors; for not being able to
conceal from herself the mediocrity of her talents, especially in such parts of
the old plays as had been performed by other actresses in a manner far
superior, she facilitated the representation of new pieces, in which she had
not to fear any humiliating comparison. The principal of these authors were LA
HARPE, DUCIS, and CHÉNIER. <a name="let54fr9"></a>The last, who, besides, is
famous as member of the National Convention and other Legislative Assemblies,
composed the tragedy of <i>Charles Neuf</i>, in which Madame VESTRIS, playing
the part of <i>Catherine de Médicis</i>, affected, I am told, to advance her
under-lip, <i>à l'Autrichienne</i>, in order to occasion comparisons injurious
to the ill-fated Marie-Antoinette.[<a href="#let54f9">9</a>]
<p class="center"><i>Characters of Princesses.</i><br />
Mesdames FLEURY, TALMA, BOURGOIN, and VOLNAIS.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle FLEURY. She has no longer youth nor beauty, and her talents as
an actress are much on a par with her personal attractions. She recites with
judgment, but almost always with languor, and betrays a want of warmth.
Besides, her powers have declined. However, she sometimes displays energetic
flashes of a real tragic truth; but they are borrowed, and it is affirmed, not
without foundation, that Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder (who is still living)
has been so obliging as to lend them to her.</p>
<p>Madame TALMA. For this name she is indebted to a divorce, having snatched
TALMA from his first wife, an elderly woman who had ruined herself for him, or
whom he had ruined. She quitted her first husband, a dancing-master of the name
of PETIT, to live under the more than friendly protection of Mademoiselle
RAUCOURT.----Madame TALMA is not handsome, and is now on the wane. She plays
tragedy, comedy, and the <i>drame</i>; but has no real talent, except in the
last-mentioned line. In the first, she wants nobleness and energy. Her delivery
is monotonous. It is said in her praise, that she has "<i>tears in her
voice</i>." I believe that it seldom happens to her to have any in her eyes,
and that this sensibility, for which some would give her credit, proceeds not
from her heart. In comedy, she wishes to assume a cavalier and bold manner,
brought into vogue by Mademoiselle CONTAT. This manner by no means suits Madame
TALMA, who neither has elegance in her shape, nor animation in her features. In
the <i>drame</i>, her defects disappear, and her good qualities remain. She
then is really interesting, and her efforts to please are rewarded by the
applause of the public.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle BOURGOIN. With respect to this young lady, a powerful
protection serves her in lieu of talent; for she is handsome. She persists in
playing tragedy, which is not her fort. In comedy, she appears to
advantage.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle VOLNAIS. This is a very young girl. All she says is in a crying
tone, and what is worse, she seems not to comprehend what she says. In the
characters which she first represented she was very successful, but is no
longer so at the present day.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Characters of Confidantes.</i><br />
Mesdames SUIN and THÉNARD.</p>
<p>There are two only who are deserving of notice. The one is Madame SUIN, who
certainly justifies the character she bears of a woman of judgment; for she has
the most just delivery of all the performers belonging to the <i>Théâtre
Français</i>; but she is advanced in years, and the public often treat her with
rudeness. The other confidante is Mademoiselle THÉNARD, who has played the
parts of princesses at this theatre with a partial success.</p>
<p>There are also other confidantes, whom it is not worth while to mention.</p>
<p>I shall conclude this account of the tragedians belonging to the <i>Théâtre
Français</i>, by observing that the revolution is said to have given a new turn
to the mind and character of the French women; and the success which several
actresses, at this day obtain in the dramatic career, in the line of tragedy,
is quoted in support of this opinion. For a number of years past, as has been
seen, Melpomene seemed to have placed the diadem on the head of Mademoiselle
RAUCOURT, and this tragic queen would probably have grown gray under the
garments of royalty, had not the revolution imparted to her sex a degree of
energy sufficient for them to dispute her empire. <a name="let54fr10"></a>Women
here have seen so many instances of cruelty, during the last ten or twelve
years, they have participated, in a manner more or less direct, in an order of
things so replete with tragical events, that those among them who feel a
<i>penchant</i> for the stage, find themselves, in consequence, disposed to
figure in tragedy.[<a href="#let54f10">10</a>]</p>

queen or princess, the number of candidates rapidly increased. For several
months past, the merit of these <i>débutantes</i> has been the general concern
of all Paris. Each had her instructor, and, of course, was carefully tutored
for the occasion.</p>
<p class="fnt">M. LEGOUVÉ, the tragic writer, first brought forward on this
stage Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS, a girl about twenty, extremely ill-favoured by
nature. DUGAZON, the actor, next introduced Madame XAVIER, a very handsome and
elegant woman. Lastly, Mademoiselle RAUCOURT presented her pupil, Mademoiselle
GEORGES WEIMER, a young girl of perfect beauty. Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS played
<i>Phèdre</i>, in RACINE'S tragedy of that name, seven successive times. She
certainly displayed a semblance of sensibility, and, notwithstanding the
disadvantages of her person, produced such an effect on the senses of the
debauched Parisian youth by the libidinous manner she adopted in the scene
where <i>Phèdre</i> declares her unconquerable passion for her son-in-law
<i>Hippolyte</i>, that her success was complete. What greater proof can be
adduced of the vitiated taste of the male part of the audience? She also
performed <i>Sémiramis</i>, <i>Didon</i>, and <i>Hermione</i>; but in the first
two characters she betrayed her deficiency. The next who entered the lists was
Madame XAVIER. On her <i>début</i> in <i>Sémiramis</i>, she was favourably
received by the public; but, afterwards, choosing to act <i>Hermione</i>, the
partisans of Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS assembled in such numbers as to constitute
a decided majority in the theatre. Not content with interrupting Madame XAVIER,
and hissing her off the stage, they waited for her at the door of the
play-house, and loaded her with the grossest abuse and imprecations. Lastly
appeared Mademoiselle GEORGES WEIMER. Warned by the disgraceful conduct of the
<i>Duchesnistes</i> (as they are called) towards Madame XAVIER, the comedians,
by issuing a great number of <i>orders</i>, contrived to anticipate them, and
obtain a majority, especially in the pit. Mademoiselle GEORGES made her
<i>début</i> in the character of <i>Clitemnestre</i>, and was well received.
Her beauty excited enthusiasm, and effected a wonderful change in public
opinion. After playing several parts in which Mademoiselle DUCHESNOIS had
either failed, or was afraid to appear, she at last ventured to rival her in
that of <i>Phèdre</i>. At the first representation of the piece, Mademoiselle
GEORGES obtained only a partial success; but, at the second, she was more
fortunate. The consequence, however, had well nigh proved truly tragic. The
<i>Duchesnistes</i> and <i>Georgistes</i> had each taken their posts, the one
on the right side of the pit; the other, on the left. When Mademoiselle GEORGES
was called for after the performance, and came forward, in order to be
applauded, the former party hissed her, when the latter falling on them, a
general battle ensued. The guard was introduced to separate the combatants; but
the <i>Duchesnistes</i> were routed; and, being the aggressors, several of them
were conducted to prison. The First Consul assisted at this representation; yet
his presence had no effect whatever in restraining the violence of these
dramatic factions.</p>
<p class="fnt">Since then, Mesdemoiselles DUCHESNOIS and GEORGES have both been
received into the company of the <i>Théâtre Français</i>. Madame XAVIER has
returned to the provinces.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let54fr10">Return to

<h2><a name="let55">LETTER LV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 22, 1802.</i></p>
<p>The observation with which I concluded my last letter, might explain why the
votaries of Thalia gain so little augmentation to their number; while those of
Melpomene are daily increasing. I shall now proceed to investigate the merits
of the former, at the <i>Théâtre Français</i>.</p>
<h3>COMEDY.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Parts of noble Fathers.</i><br />
VANHOVE and NAUDET.</p>
<p>VANHOVE. This actor is rather more sufferable in comedy than tragedy; but in
both he is very monotonous, and justifies the lines applied to him by a modern
satirist, M. DESPAZE:</p>
<p class="bq">"VANHOVE, <i>plus heureux, psalmodie à mon gré;<br />
Quel succès l'attendait, s'il eût été Curé!</i>"</p>
<p>NAUDET. I have already said that the Reverend Father NAUDET, as he is
called, played the parts of tyrants in tragedy. Never did tyrant appear so
inoffensive. As well as VANHOVE, in comedy, he neither meets with censure nor
applause from the public.</p>
<p class="center"><i>First parts, or principal lovers, in Comedy.</i><br />
MOLÉ, FLEURY, and BAPTISTE the elder.</p>
<p>MOLÉ. At this name I breathe. Perhaps you have imagined that ill-humour or
caprice had till now guided my pen; but, could I praise the talent of MOLÉ as
he deserves, you would renounce that opinion.</p>
<p>MOLÉ made his <i>début</i> at the <i>Comédie Française</i> about forty-five
years ago. He had some success; but as the Parisian public did not then become
enthusiasts in favour of mere beginners, he was sent into the provinces to
acquire practice. At the expiration of two or three years, he returned, and was
received to play the parts of young lovers in tragedy and comedy. He had not
all the nobleness requisite for the first-mentioned line of acting; but he had
warmth and an exquisite sensibility. In a word, he maintained his ground by the
side of Mademoiselle DUMESNIL and LEKAIN, two of the greatest tragedians that
ever adorned the French stage. For a long time he was famous in the parts of
<i>petits-maîtres</i>, in which he shone by his vivacity, levity, and
grace.</p>
<p>This actor was ambitious in his profession. Although applauded, and perhaps
more so than LEKAIN, he was perfectly sensible that he produced not such great,
such terrible effects; and he favoured the introduction of the <i>drame</i>,
which is a mixture of tragedy and comedy. But those who most detest the whining
style of this species of composition are compelled to acknowledge that MOLÉ was
fascinating in the part of <i>St. Albin</i>, in DIDEROT'S <i>Père de
Famille</i>.</p>
<p>BELLECOURT being dead, MOLÉ took the first parts in comedy, with the
exception of a few of those in which his predecessor excelled, whose greatest
merit, I understand, was an air noble and imposing in the highest degree. As
this was MOLÉ's greatest deficiency, he endeavoured to make amends for it by
some perfection. He had no occasion to have recourse to art. It was sufficient
for him to employ well the gifts lavished on him by nature. Though now verging
on seventy, no one expresses love with more eloquence (for sounds too have
theirs), or with more charm and fire than MOLÉ. In the fourth act of the
<i>Misanthrope</i>, he ravishes and subdues the audience, when, after having
overwhelmed <i>Célimène</i> with reproaches, he paints to her the love with
which he is inflamed. But this sentiment is not the only one in the expression
of which MOLÉ is pre-eminently successful.</p>
<p>In the <i>Philinte de Molière</i>, which also bears the title of <i>La Suite
du Misanthrope</i>, and in which FABRE D'EGLANTINE has presented the contrast
between an egotist and a man who sacrifices his interest to that of his
fellow-creatures, MOLÉ vents all the indignation of virtue with a warmth, a
truth, and even a nobleness which at this day belong only to himself. In short,
he performs this part, in which the word <i>love</i> is not once mentioned,
with a perfection that he maintains from the first line to the last.</p>
<p>In the fifth act of <i>Le Dissipateur</i> (a comedy by DESTOUCHES), when he
sees himself forsaken by his companions of pleasure, and thinks he is so by his
mistress too, the expression of his grief is so natural, that you imagine you
see the tears trickling from his eyes. In moments when he pictures love, his
voice, which at times is somewhat harsh, is softened, lowers its key, and (if I
may so express myself) goes in search of his heart, in order to draw from it
greater flexibility and feeling. The effect which he produces is irresistible
and universal. Throughout the house the most profound silence is rigidly, but
sympathetically enforced; so great is the apprehension of losing a single
monosyllable in these interesting moments, which always appear too short. To
this silence succeed shouts of acclamation and bursts of applause. I never knew
any performer command the like but Mademoiselle SAINVAL the elder.</p>
<p>In no character which MOLÉ performs, does he ever fail to deserve applause;
but there is one, above all, which has infinitely added to his reputation. It
is that of the <i>Vieux Célibataire</i> in the comedy of the same name by COLIN
D'HARLEVILLE, which he personates with a good humoured frankness, an air of
indolence and apathy, and at the same time a grace that will drive to despair
any one who shall venture to take up this part after him. On seeing him in it,
one can scarcely believe that he is the same man who renders with such warmth
and feeling the part of <i>Alceste</i> in the <i>Misanthrope</i>, and in the
<i>Suite de Molière</i>; but MOLÉ, imbibing his talent from nature, is
diversified like her.</p>
<p>Caressed by the women, associating with the most amiable persons both of the
court and the town, and, in short, idolized by the public, till the revolution,
no performer led a more agreeable life than MOLÉ. However, he was not
proscribed through it, and this was his fault. Not having been imprisoned like
the other actors of the old <i>Comédie Française</i>, he had no share in their
triumph on their reappearance, and it even required all his talent to maintain
his ground; but, as it appears that no serious error could be laid to his
charge, and as every thing is forgotten in the progress of events, he resumed
part of his ascendency. <a name="let55fr1"></a>I shall terminate this article
or panegyric, call it which you please, by observing that whenever MOLÉ shall
retire from the <i>Théâtre Français</i>, and his age precludes a contrary hope,
the best stock-pieces can no longer be acted.[<a href="#let55f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>FLEURY. A man can no more be a comedian in spite of Thalia than a poet in
spite of Minerva. Of this FLEURY affords a proof. This actor is indebted to the
revolution for the reputation he now enjoys; but what is singular, it is not
for having shewn himself the friend of that great political convulsion. Nature
has done little for him. His appearance is common; his countenance, stern; his
voice, hoarse; and his delivery, embarrassed; so much so that he speaks only by
splitting his syllables. A stammering lover! MOLÉ, it is true, sometimes
indulged in a sort of stammer, but it was suited to the moment, and not when he
had to express the ardour of love. A lover, such as is represented to us in all
French comedies, is a being highly favoured by Nature, and FLEURY shews him
only as much neglected by her. A great deal of assurance and a habit of the
stage, a warmth which proceeds from the head only, and a sort of art to
disguise his defects, with him supply the place of talent. Although naturally
very heavy, he strives to appear light and airy in the parts of
<i>petits-maîtres</i>, and his great means of success consist in turning round
on his heel. He was calculated for playing <i>grims</i> (which I shall soon
explain), and he proves this truth in the little comedy of <i>Les Deux
Pages</i>, taken from the life of the king of Prussia, the great Frederic, of
whose caricature he is the living model. He wished to play capital parts, the
parts of MOLÉ, and he completely failed. He ventured to appear in the
<i>Inconstant</i>, in which MOLÉ is captivating, and it was only to his
disgrace. Being compelled to relinquish this absurd pretension, he now confines
himself to new or secondary parts, in the former of which he has to dread no
humiliating comparison, and the latter are not worthy to be mentioned.</p>
<p>Friends within and without the theatre, and the spirit of party, have,
however, brought FLEURY into fashion. He will, doubtless, preserve his vogue;
for, in Paris, when a man has once got a name, he may dispense with talent:</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Des réputations; on ne sait pourquoi!</i>"</p>
<p>says GRESSET, the poet, in his comedy of <i>Le Méchant</i>, speaking of
those which are acquired in the capital of France.</p>
<p>BAPTISTE the elder. But for the revolution, he too would, in all
probability, never have figured on the <i>Théâtre Français</i>. When all
privileges were abolished, a theatre was opened in the <i>Rue Culture St.
Catherine</i> in Paris, and BAPTISTE was sent for from Rouen to perform the
first parts. In <i>Robert Chef des Brigands</i> and <i>La Mère Coupable</i>,
two <i>drames</i>, the one almost as full of improbabilities as the other, he
had great success; but in <i>Le Glorieux</i> he acquired a reputation almost as
gigantic as his stature, and as brilliant as his coat covered with spangles.
This was the part in which BELLECOURT excelled, and which had been respected
even by MOLÉ. The latter at length appeared in it; but irony, which is the
basis of this character, was not his talent: yet MOLÉ having seen the court,
and knowing in what manner noblemen conducted themselves, BAPTISTE had an
opportunity of correcting himself by him in the part of <i>Le Glorieux</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Théâtre Français</i> being in want of a performer for such
characters, BAPTISTE was called in. Figure to yourself the person of Don
Quixote, and you will have an idea of that of this actor, whose countenance,
however, is unmeaning, and whose voice seems to issue from the mouth of a
speaking-trumpet.</p>
<p class="center">Jeunes premiers, <i>or young lovers, in Comedy</i>.<br />
ST. FAL, DUPONT, DAMAS, and ARMAND.</p>
<p>One might assemble what is best in these four actors, without making one
perfect <i>lover</i>. I have already spoken of the first three, who, in comedy,
have nearly the same defects as in tragedy. As for the fourth, he is young; but
unfortunately for him, he has no other recommendation.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="let55fr2"></a><i>Characters of</i> Grims, <i>or</i>
Rôles à manteau.[<a href="#let55f2">2</a>]<br />
GRANDMÉNIL and CAUMONT.</p>
<p>GRANDMÉNIL. This performer is, perhaps, the only one who has preserved what
the French critics call <i>la tradition</i>, that is, a traditionary knowledge
of the old school, or of the style in which players formerly acted, and
especially in the time of MOLIÈRE. This would be an advantage for him, but for
a defect which it is not in his power to remedy; for what avails justness of
diction when a speaker can no longer make himself heard? And this is the case
with GRANDMÉNIL. However, I would advise you to see him in the character of the
<i>Avare</i> (in MOLIÈRE'S comedy of that name) which suits him perfectly. By
placing yourself near the stage, you might lose nothing of the truth and
variety of his delivery, as well as of the play of his countenance, which is
facilitated by his excessive meagreness, and to which his sharp black eyes give
much vivacity.</p>
<p>GRANDMÉNIL is member of the National Institute.</p>
<p>CAUMONT. He possesses that in which his principal in this cast of parts is
deficient, and little more. One continually sees the efforts he makes to be
comic, which sufficiently announces that he is not naturally so. However, he
has a sort of art, which consists in straining his acting a little without
overcharging it.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Parts of Valets</i>.<br />
DUGAZON, DAZINCOURT, and LAROCHELLE.</p>
<p>DUGAZON. One may say much good and much ill of this actor, and yet be
perfectly correct. He has no small share of warmth and comic humour. He plays
sometimes as if by inspiration; but more frequently too he charges his parts
immoderately. PRÉVILLE, who is no common authority, said of DUGAZON: "How well
he can play, if he is in the humour!" He is but seldom in the humour, and when
he is requested not to overcharge his parts, 'tis then that he charges them
most. Not that he is a spoiled child of the public; for they even treat him
sometimes with severity. True it is that he is reproached for his conduct
during the storms of the revolution. Although advanced in years, he became
Aide-de-camp to SANTERRE.----SANTERRE! An execrable name, and almost generally
execrated! Is then a mixture of horror and ridicule one of the characteristics
of the revolution? And must a painful remembrance come to interrupt a recital
which ought to recall cheerful ideas only? In his quality of Aide-de-camp to
the Commandant of the national guard of Paris, DUGAZON was directed to
superintend the interment of the unfortunate Lewis XVI, and in order to consume
in an instant the body of that prince, whose pensioner he had been, he caused
it to be placed in a bed of quick lime. No doubt, DUGAZON did no more than
execute the orders he received; but he was to blame in putting himself in a
situation to receive them.</p>
<p>Not to return too abruptly to the tone which suits an article wherein I am
speaking of actors playing comic parts, I shall relate a circumstance which had
well nigh become tragic, in regard to DUGAZON, and which paints the temper of
the time when it took place. Being an author as well as an actor, DUGAZON had
written a little comedy, entitled <i>Le Modéré</i>. It was his intention to
depress the quality indicated by the title. However, he was thought to have
treated his subject ill, and, after all, to have made his <i>modéré</i> an
honest man. In consequence of this opinion, at the very moment when he was
coming off the stage, after having personated that character in his piece, he
was apprehended and taken to prison.</p>
<p>DAZINCOURT. In no respect can the same reproaches be addressed to him as to
DUGAZON; but as to what concerns the art, it may be said that if DUGAZON goes
beyond the mark, DAZINCOURT falls short of it. PRÉVILLE said of the latter as a
comedian: "Leaving pleasantry out of the question, DAZINCOURT is well enough."
Nothing can be added to the opinion of that great master.</p>
<p>LAROCHELLE. He has warmth, truth, and much comic humour; but is sometimes a
little inclined to charge his parts. He has a good stage face. It appears that
he can only perform parts not overlong, as his voice easily becomes hoarse.
This is a misfortune both for himself and the public; for he really might make
a good comedian.</p>
<p>There are a few secondary actors in the comic line, such as BAPTISTE the
younger, who performs in much too silly a manner his parts of simpletons, and
one DUBLIN, who is the ostensible courier; not to speak of some others, whose
parts are of little importance.</p>
<p class="right"><i>January 22, in continuation,</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Principal female Characters, in Comedy.</i><br />
Mesdemoiselles CONTAT, and MÉZERAY.&mdash;Madame TALMA.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle CONTAT. This actress has really brought about a revolution in
the theatre. Before her time, the essential requisites for the parts which she
performs, were sensibility, decorum, nobleness, and dignity, even in diction,
as well as in gestures, and deportment. Those qualities are not incompatible
with the grace, the elegance of manners, and the playfulness also required by
those characters, the principal object of which is to interest and please,
which ought only to touch lightly on comic humour, and not be assimilated to
that of chambermaids, as is done by Mademoiselle CONTAT. A great coquette, for
instance, like <i>Célimène</i> in the <i>Misanthrope</i>, ought not to be
represented as a girl of the town, nor <i>Madame de Clainville</i>, in the
pretty little comedy of <i>La Gageure</i>, as a shopkeeper's wife.</p>
<p>The innovation made by Mademoiselle CONTAT was not passed over without
remonstrance. Those strict judges, those conservators of rules, those arbiters
of taste, in short, who had been long in the habit of frequenting the theatre,
protested loudly against this new manner of playing the principal characters.
"That is not becoming!" exclaimed they incessantly: which signified "that is
not the truth!" But what could the feeble remonstrances of the old against the
warm applause of the young?</p>
<p>Mademoiselle CONTAT had a charming person, of which you may still be
convinced. She was not then, as she is now, overloaded with <i>embonpoint</i>,
and, though rather inclined to stoop, could avail herself of the advantages of
an elevated stature. None of the resources of the toilet were neglected by her,
and for a long time the most elegant women in Paris took the <i>ton</i> for
dress from Mademoiselle CONTAT. Besides, she always had a delicacy of
discrimination in her delivery, and a varied sprightliness in the
<i>minutiæ</i> of her acting. Her voice, though sometimes rather shrill, is not
deficient in agreeableness, but is easily modulated, except when it is
necessary for her to express feeling. The inferiority of Mademoiselle CONTAT on
this head is particularly remarkable when she plays with MOLÉ. In a very
indifferent comedy, called <i>Le Jaloux sans amour</i>, at the conclusion of
which the husband entreats his wife to pardon his faults, MOLÉ contrives to
find accents so tender, so affecting; he envelops his voice, as it were, with
sounds so soft, so mellow, and at the same time so delicate, that the audience,
fearing to lose the most trifling intonation, dare not draw their breath.
Mademoiselle CONTAT replies, and, although she has to express the same degree
of feeling, the charm is broken.</p>
<p>Being aware that the want of nobleness and sensibility was a great obstacle
to her success, this actress endeavoured to insure it by performing characters
which require not those two qualities. The first she selected for her purpose
was <i>Susanne</i> in the <i>Mariage de Figaro</i>. <i>Susanne</i> is an
elegant and artful chambermaid; and Mademoiselle CONTAT possessed every
requisite for representing well the part. She had resigned the principal
character in the piece to Mademoiselle SAINVAL the younger, an actress who was
celebrated in tragedy, but had never before appeared in comedy. On this
occasion, I saw Mademoiselle SAINVAL play that ungracious part with a truth, a
grace, a nobleness, a dignity, a perfection in short, of which no idea had yet
been entertained in Paris.</p>
<p>Another part in which Mademoiselle CONTAT also rendered herself famous, is
that of <i>Madame Evrard</i>, in the <i>Vieux Célibataire</i>.&mdash;<i>Madame
Evrard</i> is an imperious, cunning, and roguish housekeeper; and this actress
has no difficulty in seizing the <i>ton</i> suitable to such a character. This
could not be done by one habituated to a more noble manner. Mademoiselle CONTAT
has not followed the impulse of Nature, who intended her for the characters of
<i>soubrettes</i>; but, when she made her <i>début</i>, there were in that cast
of parts three or four women not deficient in merit, and it would have taken
her a long time to make her way through them.</p>
<p>The parts which Mademoiselle CONTAT plays at present with the greatest
success are those in the pieces of MARIVAUX, which all bear a strong
resemblance, and the nature of which she alters; for it is also one of her
defects to change always the character drawn by the author. The reputation
enjoyed by this actress is prodigious; and such a <i>critique</i> as the one I
am now writing would raise in Paris a general clamour. Her defects, it is true,
are less prominent at this day, when hereditary rank is annihilated; and merit,
more than manners, raises men to the highest stations. Besides, it is a
presumption inherent in the Parisians to believe that they never can be
mistaken. To reason with them on taste is useless; it is impossible to compel
them to retract when they have once said "<i>Cela est charmant</i>."</p>
<p>Before I take leave of Mademoiselle CONTAT, I shall observe that there
exists in the <i>Théâtre Français</i> a little league, of which she is the
head. Besides herself, it is composed of Mademoiselle DEVIENNE, DAZINCOURT, and
FLEURY. I am confidently assured that the choice and reception of pieces, and
the <i>début</i> of performers depend entirely on them. As none of them possess
all the requisites for their several casts of parts, they take care to play no
other than pieces of an equivocal kind, in which neither <i>bon ton</i>, nor
<i>vis comica</i> is to be found. They avoid, above all, those of MOLIÈRE and
REGNARD, and are extremely fond of the comedies of MARIVAUX, in which masters
and lackies express themselves and act much alike. The unison is then perfect,
and some people call this <i>de l'ensemble</i>, as if any could result from
such a confusion of parts of an opposite nature. As for new pieces, the members
of the league must have nothing but <i>papillotage</i> (as the French call it),
interspersed with allusions to their own talent, which the public never fail to
applaud. When an author has inserted such compliments in his piece, he is sure
of its being received, but not always of its being successful; for when the
ground is bad, the tissue is good for nothing.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle MÉZERAY. She is of the school of Mademoiselle CONTAT, whence
have issued only feeble pupils. But she is very pretty, and has the finest eyes
imaginable. She plays the parts of young coquettes, in which her principal
dares no longer appear. Without being vulgar in her manner, one cannot say that
she has dignity. As for sensibility, she expresses it still less than
Mademoiselle CONTAT. However, the absence of this sentiment is a defect which
is said to be now common among the French. Indeed, if it be true that they are
fickle, and this few will deny, the feeling they possess cannot be lasting.</p>
<p>Madame TALMA. I have already spoken of her merits as a comic actress, when I
mentioned her as a tragedian.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Parts of young Lovers.</i><br />
Mesdemoiselles MARS, BOURGOIN, and GROS.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle MARS. She delivers in an ingenuous manner innocent parts, and
those of lovers. She has modest graces, an interesting countenance, and appears
exceedingly handsome on the stage. But she will never be a true actress.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle BOURGOIN. She has some disposition for comedy, which she
neglects, and has none for tragedy, in which she is ambitious to figure. I have
already alluded to her beauty, which is that of a pretty <i>grisette</i>.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle GROS. She is the pupil of DUGAZON, and made her <i>début</i> in
tragedy. The newspaper-writers transformed her into Melpomene, yet so rapid was
her decline, that presently she was scarcely more than a waiting woman to
Thalia.</p>
<p class="center">Characters, <i>or foolish Mothers</i>.<br />
Mesdemoiselles LACHAISSAIGNE and THÉNARD.</p>
<p>The latter of these titles explains the former. In fact, this cast of parts
consists of <i>characters</i>, that is, foolish or crabbed old women,
antiquated dowagers in love, &amp;c. Commonly, these parts are taken up by
actresses grown too old for playing <i>soubrettes</i>; but to perform them
well, requires no trifling share of comic humour; for, in general, they are
charged with it. At the present day, this department may be considered as
vacant. Mademoiselle LACHAISSAIGNE, who is at the head of it, is very old, and
never had the requisites for performing in it to advantage. Mademoiselle
THÉNARD begins to <i>double</i> her in this line of acting, but in a manner
neither more sprightly nor more captivating.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Parts of</i> Soubrettes <i>or Chambermaids</i>.<br />
Mesdemoiselles DEVIENNE and DESBROSSES.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle DEVIENNE. If Mademoiselle CONTAT changes the principal
characters in comedy into those of chambermaids, Mademoiselle DEVIENNE does the
contrary, and from the same motive, namely, because she is deficient in the
requisites for her cast of parts, such as warmth, comic truth, and vivacity.
Yet, while she assumes the airs of a fine lady, she takes care to dwell on the
slightest <i>équivoque</i>; so that what would be no more than gay in the mouth
of another woman, in hers becomes indecent. As she is a mannerist in her
acting, some think it perfect, and they say too that she is charming. However,
she must have been very handsome.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle DESBROSSES. The public say nothing of her, and I think this is
all she can wish for.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>I have now passed in review before you those who are charged to display to
advantage the dramatic riches bequeathed to the French nation by CORNEILLE,
RACINE, MOLIÈRE, CRÉBILLON, VOLTAIRE, REGNARD, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If it be
impossible to squander them, at least they may at present be considered as no
more than a buried treasure. Although the <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i> of those
masters of the stage are still frequently represented, and the public even
appear to see them with greater pleasure than new pieces, they no longer
communicate that electric fire which inflames genius, and (if I may use the
expression) renders it productive. A great man can, it is true, create every
thing himself; but there are minds which require an impulse to be set in
motion. Without a CORNEILLE, perhaps the French nation would not have had a
RACINE.</p>
<p>Formerly, people went to the <i>Théâtre Français</i> in order to hear, as it
were, a continual course of eloquence, elocution, and pronunciation. It even
had the advantage over the pulpit and the bar, where vivacity of expression was
prohibited or restricted. Many a sacred or profane orator came hither, either
privately or publicly, to study the art by which great actors, at pleasure,
worked on the feelings of the audience, and charmed their very soul. It was,
above all, at the <i>Théâtre Français</i> that foreigners might have learned to
pronounce well the French language. The audience shuddered at the smallest
fault of pronunciation committed by a performer, and a thousand voices
instantly corrected him. At the present day, the comedians insist that it
belongs to them alone to form rules on this point, and they now and then seem
to vie with each other in despising those already established. The audience
being perhaps too indulgent, they stand uncorrected.</p>
<p>Whether or not the <i>Théâtre Français</i> will recover its former fame, is
a question which Time alone can determine. Undoubtedly, many persons of a true
taste and an experienced ear have disappeared, and no one now seems inclined to
say to the performers: "That is the point which you must attain, and at which
you must stop, if you wish not to appear deficient, or to overact your part."
But the fact is, they are without a good model, and the spectators, in general,
are strangers to the <i>minutiæ</i> of dramatic excellence. In tragedy, indeed,
I am inclined to think that there never existed at the <i>Théâtre Français</i>
such a deficiency of superior talents. When LEKAIN rose into fame, there were
not, I have been told, any male performers who went as far as himself, though
several possessed separately the qualifications necessary for that line.
However, there was Mademoiselle DUMESNIL, a pupil of nature, from whom he might
learn to express all the passions; while from Mademoiselle CLAIRON he might
snatch all the secrets of art.</p>
<p>As for Comedy, it is almost in as desperate a situation. The <i>ton</i> of
society and that of comedians may have a reciprocal influence, and the
revolution having tended to degrade the performance of the latter, the
consequences may recoil on the former. But here I must stop.&mdash;I shall only
add that it is not to the revolution that the decline of the art, either in
tragedy or comedy, is to be imputed. It is, I understand, owing to intrigue,
which has, for a long time past, introduced pitiful performers on the stage of
the <i>Théâtre Français</i>, and to a multiplicity of other causes which it
would be too tedious to discuss, or even to mention. Notwithstanding the
encomiums daily lavished on the performers by the venal pen of newspaper
writers, the truth is well known here on this subject. Endeavours are made by
the government to repair the mischief by forming pupils; but how are they to be
formed without good masters or good models?</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let55f1">Footnote 1</a>: It must grieve every admirer
of worth and talent to hear that MOLÉ is now no more. Not long since he paid
the debt of nature. As an actor, it is more than probable that "we ne'er shall
look on his like again."&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let55fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let55f2">Footnote 2</a>: The word <i>Grim</i>, in
French theatrical language, is probably derived from <i>grimace</i>, and the
expression of <i>Rôles à manteau</i> arises from the personages which they

cloak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let55fr2">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let56">LETTER LVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 24, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Among the customs introduced here since the revolution, that of women
appearing in public in male attire is very prevalent. The more the Police
endeavours to put a stop to this extravagant whim, the more some females seek
excuses for persisting in it: the one makes a pretext of business which obliges
her to travel frequently, and thinks she is authorized to wear men's clothes as
being more convenient on a journey; another, of truly-elegant form, dresses
herself in this manner, because  she wishes to attract more notice by
singularity, without reflecting that, in laying aside her proper garb, she
loses those feminine graces, the all-seductive accompaniments of beauty.
Formerly, indeed, nothing could tend more to disguise the real shape of a woman
than the</p>
<p class="center">COSTUME OF THE FRENCH LADIES.</p>
<p>A head-dress, rising upwards of half a yard in height, seemed to place her
face near the middle of her body; her stomach was compressed into a stiff case
of whalebone, which checked respiration, and deprived her almost of the power
of eating; while a pair of cumbersome hoops, placed on her hips, gave to her
petticoats the amplitude of a small elliptical, inflated balloon. Under these
strange accoutrements, it would, at first sight, almost have puzzled BUFFON
himself to decide in what species such a female animal should be classed.
However, this is no longer an enigma.</p>
<p>With the parade of a court, all etiquette of dress disappeared. Divested of
their uncouth and unbecoming habiliments, the women presently adopted a style
of toilet not only more advantageous to the display of their charms, but also
more analogous to modern manners.</p>
<p>No sooner was France proclaimed a republic, than the annals of republican
antiquity were ransacked for models of female attire: the Roman tunic and Greek
<i>cothurnus</i> soon adorned the shoulders of the Parisian <i>élégantes</i>;
and every antique statue or picture, relating to those periods of history, was,
in some shape or another, rendered tributary to the ornament of their
person.</p>
<p>This revolution in their dress has evidently tended to strengthen their
constitution, and give them a pectoral <i>embonpoint</i>, very agreeable, no
doubt, to the amateur of female proportion, but the too open exposure of which
cannot, in a moral point of view, be altogether approved. These treasures are,
in consequence, now as plentiful as they were before uncommon. You can scarcely
move a step in Paris without seeing something of this kind to exercise your
admiration. Many of those domains of love, which, under the old-fashioned
dress, would have been considered as a flat country, now present, through a
transparent crape, the perfect rotundity of two sweetly-rising hillocks. As
prisoners, wan and disfigured by confinement, recover their health and fulness
on being restored to liberty, so has the bosom of the Parisian belles, released
from the busk and corset, experienced a salutary expansion.</p>
<p>In a political light, this must afford no small satisfaction to him who
takes an interest in the physical improvement of the human species, as it tends
to qualify them better for that maternal office, dictated by Nature, and which,
in this country, has too long and too frequently been intrusted to the
uncertain discharge  of a mercenary hireling. Another advantage too arises from
the established fashion. Thanks to the ease of their dress, the French ladies
can now satisfy all the capacity of their appetite. Nothing prevents the
stomach from performing its functions; nothing paralyzes the spring of that
essential organ. Nor, indeed, can they be reproached with fastidiousness on
that score. From the soup to the desert, they are not one moment idle: they eat
of every thing on the table, and drink in due proportion. Not that I would by
any means insinuate that they drink more than is necessary or proper. On the
contrary, no women on earth are more temperate, in this respect, than the
French; they, for the most part, mix water even with their weakest wine; but
they also swallow two or three glasses of <i>vin de dessert</i>, without making
an affected grimace, and what is better, they eat at this rate without any ill
consequence, Now, a good appetite and good digestion must strengthen health,
and, in general, tend to produce pectoral <i>embonpoint</i>.</p>
<p>In this capital, you no longer find among the fair sex those over-delicate
constitutions, whose artificial existence could be maintained only by salts,
essences, and distilled waters. Charms as fresh as those of Hebe, beauties
which might rival the feminine softness of those of Venus, while they bespeak
the vigour of Diana, and the bloom of Hygëia, are the advantages which
distinguish many of the Parisian belles of the present day, and for which they
are, in a great measure, indebted to the freedom they enjoy under the antique
costume.</p>
<p>In no part of the world, perhaps, do women pay a more rigid attention to
cleanliness in their person than in Paris. The frequent use of the tepid bath,
and of every thing tending to preserve the beauty of their fine forms, employ
their constant solicitude. So much care is not thrown away. No where, I
believe, are women now to be seen more uniformly healthy, no where do they
possess more the art of assisting nature; no where, in a word, are they better
skilled in concealing and repairing the ravages of Time, not so much by the use
of cosmetics, as by the tasteful manner in which they vary the decoration of
their person.</p>
<h2><a name="let57">LETTER LVII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 25, 1802.</i></p>
<p>I have already observed that the general effervescence to which the
revolution gave birth, soon extended to the seminaries of learning. The
alarm-bell resounded even in the most silent of those retreats. Bands of
insurgents, intermixed with women, children, and men of every condition, came
each moment to interrupt the studies, and, forcing the students to range
themselves under their filthy banner, presented to them the spectacle of every
excess. <a name="let57fr1"></a>It required not all this violence to disorganize
institutions already become antiquated,[<a href="#let57f1">1</a>] and few of
which any longer enjoyed much consideration in the public opinion. The colleges
and universities were deserted, and their exercises ceased. Not long after,
they were suppressed. The only establishment of this description which has
survived the storms of the revolution, and which is no less important from its
utility than extensive in its object, is the</p>
<p class="center">COLLÈGE DE FRANCE.</p>
<p>It neither owed this exemption to its ancient celebrity, nor to the talents
of its professors; but having no rich collections which could attract notice,
no particular estates which could tempt cupidity, it was merely forgotten by
the revolutionists, and their ignorance insured its preservation.</p>
<p>The <i>Collège de France</i> is, at the present day, in this country, and
perhaps in the rest of Europe, the only establishment where every branch of
human knowledge is taught in its fullest extent. The object of this institution
is to spread the most elevated notions of the sciences, to maintain and pave
the way to the progress of literature, either by preserving the taste and
purity of the ancient authors, or by exhibiting the order, lustre, and richness
of the modern. Its duty is to be continually at the head of all the
establishments of public instruction, in order to guide them, lead them on,
and, as it were, light them with the torch of knowledge.</p>
<p>This college, which is situated in the <i>Place de Cambray</i>, <i>Rue St.
Jacques</i>, was founded by Francis I. That monarch, distinguished from all
cotemporaries by his genius, amiableness, and magnificence, saw in literature
the source of the glory of princes, and of the civilization of the people. He
loved and honoured it, not only in the writings of the learned, but in the
learned themselves, whom he called about his person, at the same time loading
them with encouragement and favours. It is singular that those times, so rude
in many respects, were, nevertheless, productive of sentiments the most
delicate and noble.</p>
<p>Truth never shuns princes who welcome it. Francis I was not suffered to
remain ignorant of the deplorable state in which literature then was in France,
and, though very young, he disdained not this information. Nothing, in fact,
could approach nearer to barbarism. The impulse Charlemagne had given to study
was checked. The torches he had lighted were on the point of being
extinguished. That famous university which he had created had fallen into
decline. A prey to all the cavils of pedantry, it substituted dispute and
quibble to true philosophy.</p>
<p>Nothing was any longer talked of but the <i>five universals</i>,
<i>substance</i>, and <i>accident</i>. All the fury of argument was manifested
to know whether those were simple figures, or beings really existing, all
things equally useful to the revival of knowledge and the happiness of mankind.
The Hebrew and Greek tongues were scarcely, if at all, known; the living
languages, little cultivated; Latin itself, then almost common, was taught in
the most rude and imperfect manner. In short, the most learned body of the
State had fallen into the most profound ignorance: a striking example of the
necessity of renewing continually and maintaining the life of those bodies
employed in instruction.</p>
<p>I am not speaking of the sciences, then entirely unknown. The languages were
every thing at this period, on account of their connexion with religion.</p>
<p>The small number of men of merit whom the bad taste of the age had not
reached, were striving to restore to literature its lustre, and to men's minds
their true direction; but, in order to revive the taste for good studies, it
was necessary to create a new establishment for public instruction, which
should be sufficiently extensive for acquiring a great influence. It was
necessary to assemble men the most celebrated for their talent and reputation,
in order that, being thus placed in full view, and presented to public
attention, they might rectify the minds of men by their authority, as well as
enlighten them by their knowledge.</p>
<p>This undertaking, difficult in itself, became much less so through the
circumstances which then existed. Taste seemed to have taken refuge at the
court, and the king easily yielded to the reasons of the learned who approached
him; but no one took a greater share in this project than the celebrated
Erasmus. Remote from it as he was, he accelerated its execution by the
disinterested praises which he lavished on it. The king sent to invite him, in
the most flattering terms, to take the direction of it and to settle in France;
but Erasmus, jealous of liberty, retained besides by the gratitude he owed to
Charles V, and by the care he bestowed on the College of Louvain which he had
founded, refused this task, equally honourable and useful. He manifested not
the less, in his letters, the joy he felt to see studies re-established by the
only means which could reanimate them. It is pleasing to the true friends of
the sciences to find among those who cultivate them similar traits of
generosity and nobleness.</p>
<p>At length peace having restored to France repose and the means of repairing
her losses, the king gave himself up without reserve to the desire he had of
making the sciences flourish, and realized the grand project of public
instruction which had for a long time occupied his mind. The new college took
the name of <i>Collège Royal</i>. It had professors for the Hebrew and Greek
tongues, and some even for the mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and the
living languages.</p>
<p>The formation of the <i>Collège Royal</i> gave great displeasure to the
University. After having held so long without a rival the sceptre of the
sciences and literature, it was grating to its members to relinquish it. They
could ill bear to see set above it an establishment evidently intended to
direct and guide it. Self-love offended seldom forgives, especially when it is
animated by the <i>esprit de corps</i>. The University depreciated the new
college, and endeavoured to fetter it in a thousand ways. At last, those dark
intrigues being constantly smothered by the applause which the professors
received, the University finished by bringing them before a court of justice.
From, envy to persecution there is but one step, and that step was soon
taken.</p>
<p>Religion served as a pretext and a cloak for this accusation. It was
affirmed that the new professors could not, without danger to the faith,
explain the Hebrew and Greek tongues, if they had not been presented to the
University to be examined by it, and received from it their mission. To this it
was answered, that if the theologians of the University understood Greek and
Hebrew, it must be easy for them to denounce the passages in which the new
professors had erred, and that if, on the contrary, they did not understand
those languages, they ought not to pretend to judge those who taught them.
After long debates, things were left in the state in which they were before the
trial. Each party continued quietly its lessons, and, as it almost always
happens in such cases, reason ended by having its due weight: true it is that
it was then supported by royal authority.</p>
<p>The <i>Collège de France</i> has not since ceased to make an increasing
progress. It even had the valuable advantage of reforming itself successively,
and of following new ideas, the necessary result of its constitution and of the
lustre that has always surrounded it; two causes which have occasioned its
chairs to be sought by the most celebrated men of every description. It is this
successive reform which constitutes the distinctive character of the <i>Collège
de France</i>, and which has always enabled it to fulfil its real object.</p>
<p>Thus, to quote but one example. The chair of Greek philosophy was, in the
beginning, intended to make known the writings of the ancient philosophers on
the nature of things and the organization of the universe. These were, at that
time, the only repositories of human knowledge for mathematics and physics;
but, in proportion as the sciences, more advanced, substituted rational
theories for hazardous conjectures, the modern discoveries of astronomy were
taught, together with the writings of the ancients. The object of this chair,
which at the present day bears the name of general physics and mathematics, is
to disseminate the most elevated notions of mechanics and the theory of the
system of the world. The works taught by its occupier are analytical mechanics
and celestial mechanics, that is, those works which form the limits of our
knowledge for mathematical analysis, and consequently those of which it is most
important to increase the very small number of readers.</p>
<p>By a consequence of that spirit of amelioration which animates this College,
some time before the revolution, a chair and a cabinet of experimental physics
were added to it.</p>
<p>As for the natural sciences, which are taught here with much depth and
detail in several establishments, they have, in the <i>Collège de France</i>, a
sort of regulator which directs them, as it were, by their generalities. It is,
in fact, to this only that an establishment which, by its nature, contains no
collection, ought to attach itself, and the philosophy of the sciences, the
result and completion of their study, here constitutes the object of all the
lectures.</p>
<p>Thus the improvements which the sciences have successively experienced, have
always been spread by the instruction of the <i>Collège Royal</i>; and among
the professors who have occupied its chairs, none can be quoted who have been
strangers to their progress.</p>
<p>The revolution, which overthrew in France the ancient universities,
suspended for some time the exercises of this establishment; but, under the
name of <i>Collège de France</i>, it has since resumed a new lustre. It then
found itself compelled to new efforts, in order to maintain its place among the
scientific institutions, which have emulously risen in every branch of human
knowledge. Nevertheless, those different sciences, even natural history, and
the curative art, taught with so much perfection in private establishments,
have hence derived great advantages, and here it is that public instruction
comes at once to be resumed, investigated, and extended.</p>
<p>The present government appears to be perfectly sensible of the importance of
such an establishment. The enlightened men, the celebrated <i>savans</i>, who
approach it, have pointed out in the <i>Collège de France</i> a <i>normal</i>
school, completely formed, and which unites to the extent of its object the
ever-powerful ascendant of seniority. The similarity between the circumstances
in which this institution is at the present day and those when it was founded,
affords the most certain hope of its progress being maintained and
accelerated.</p>
<p>This is what appears to me the most interesting in the history of this
ancient college. I say nothing of its present professors; their zeal is proved
by their assiduous and uninterrupted lessons; their merit is before the
judgment of the public; and as for their names, these are indifferent to the
results of their labours. If any other motive than that of the interest of the
sciences were blended with the information I now communicate, I should not
think that, in this letter, I was fulfilling the object of your wishes.</p>
<p>P.S. It may not be useless to mention that no students are attached to the
<i>Collège de France</i>. The lectures are public; and every one who is
desirous of improving his mind in any branch of science, may attend them free
of expense or trouble. It is impossible for the friend of learning to withhold
his admiration from so noble an institution. What, in fact, can be more liberal
than this gratuitous diffusion of knowledge?</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let57f1">Footnote 1</a>: Whatever sentiment may have
been preserved respecting the ancient University of Paris, every impartial
person must acknowledge that it was several centuries in arrear in regard to
every thing which concerns the Arts and Sciences. Peripatetic, when the learned
had, with Descartes, renounced the philosophy of Aristotle, it became
Cartesian, when they were Newtonians. Such is the too general custom of bodies,
engaged in instruction, who make no discoveries. Invested at their formation
with great influence over scientific opinions, because they are composed of the
best informed men of the day, they wish constantly to preserve those
advantages. They with reluctance suffer that there should be formed, elsewhere
than in their own bosom, new opinions which might balance theirs; and if the
progress of the sciences at last obliges them to abandon their doctrine, they
never adopt the most modern theories, were they, in other respects, preferable;
but embrace those which existed for some time anterior to them, and which they
themselves had before combated. This inertness of bodies, employed in
instruction, is an unavoidable evil; because it is the effect of self-love, the
most invariable of passions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let57fr1">Return to

<h2><a name="let58">LETTER LVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 17, 1802.</i></p>
<p>If we do not consider the <i>Opera Buffa</i> as a national theatre, then the
next in rank, after the Grand French Opera and the <i>Théâtre Français</i>, is
the</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE DE L'OPÉRA COMIQUE.</p>
<p>This house, which is situated in the <i>Rue Feydeau</i>, near the <i>Rue de
la Loi</i>, was opened for the first time in January 1791. The entrance to it
is by a circular vestibule, externally decorated with caryatides, and
sufficiently spacious for one carriage to enter while another drives off by an
adjoining outlet. At the end of this vestibule is a long gallery, bordered by
shops on both sides, which forms a second entrance by the <i>Rue Filles St.
Thomas</i>.</p>
<p>The interior form of this theatre is a semi-circle, extended in a right line
at its extremities, which places the orchestra in a central position, and
renders the house one of the fittest in Paris for a concert. Two rows of Gothic
pillars, one above the other, occupy nearly all its height; and though it
contains eight tiers of boxes, five only are in sight. The same distribution
repeated in regard to the stage-boxes, presents a very projecting pavilion,
which seems to support a large triumphal arch. However grand this style of
architecture may be in appearance, in effect it renders the seats very
inconvenient to two-thirds of the spectators. The ornaments consist of a
strange mixture of the Greek, Gothic, and Oriental. The house is said to
contain two thousand persons.</p>
<p>In the beginning, this theatre united the performers of the original
<i>Opéra Buffa</i> and some of those belonging to the old French Comic Opera,
who played alternately. The former retiring from Paris in 1792, the latter for
some time attracted full houses by the excellence of their style of singing,
tasteful decorations, and one of the best composed orchestras in the
capital.</p>
<p>Since then, it has experienced the changes and vicissitudes attendant on the
revolution. At present, the company is composed of a selection from the
performers of the <i>Opéra Comique</i> of the <i>Théâtre Favart</i> (formerly
known by the name of <i>Théâtre Italien</i>), and those of the lyric theatre of
which I am now speaking. This junction has not long been effected. Previously
to its taking place, the <i>Comédie Italienne</i>, where French comic operas
only were represented, was still constituted as it was under the old
<i>régime</i>, of which it was remarked as being the sole remnant.</p>
<p><a name="let58fr1"></a>Formerly, the French Comic Opera was very rich in
stock-pieces, chiefly written by FAVART, SÉDAINE, MARMONTEL,
HÈLE,[<a href="#let58f1">1</a>] MONVEL, MARSOLIER, HOFFMAN, and others. Their
productions were set to music by GRÉTRY, MONSIGNY, PHILIDOR, DÉSAÏDES,
DALEYRAC, &amp;c. These pieces are now seldom played, the music of them being
antiquated; though for energy and truth of expression some of it surpasses that
of many of the more modern compositions. The new authors are little known. The
composers of the music are MÉHUL, DALEYRAC before-mentioned, BOYELDIEU, TARCHI,
&amp;c. The modern pieces the most in vogue and most attractive are <i>Le
Prisonnier</i>, <i>l'Opéra Comique</i>, a piece so called, <i>Le Calife de
Bagdad</i>, <i>Maison à vendre</i>, <i>D'Auberge en Auberge</i>, and a few
others of the same description. All these are really pleasing comedies.</p>
<p>The <i>Théâtre Feydeau</i> itself was also in possession of a great number
of stock-pieces, among which were some in the style of the Grand French Opera.
A considerable change seems to have taken place, as the latter are now no
longer represented.</p>
<p>In surveying the <i>Opéra Comique</i>, one would imagine that, in lieu of
one company, two separate ones had been formed to play in the same theatre. The
former is the weaker in number, but the stronger in talent. The latter, though
weaker, has some good performers, in the long list of those of whom it is
composed; but, in general, they are either no longer in their pristine lustre,
or have not yet attained a competent degree of perfection.</p>
<p>Seldom are the two companies mixed. Pieces in the style of the modern
<i>Opéra Comique</i>, in which easy mirth is replaced by quaint jests, are
played exclusively by the former. They draw crowded houses, as the public are
extremely partial to them. Lyric <i>drames</i> are abandoned to the latter, and
the old stock-pieces to such of the performers as choose to act in them for a
small number of spectators who are so obliging as to enter the house with
<i>orders</i> or <i>free</i> admission. OF all the repositories of old pieces
that of the <i>Comédie Italienne</i> is the one which is the most entirely
neglected. This is rather the fault of the actors than that of the public.
There are many old productions which would attract a crowd, were the best
performers to play them; but who likes to pay for seeing a master-piece
murdered?&mdash;We now come to speak of the qualifications of these
performers.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Principal Characters and parts of Lovers.</i><br />
Counter-Tenors.<br />
ELLEVIOU, GAVAUDAN, PHILIPPE, and GAVEAUX.</p>
<p>ELLEVIOU. He is the first singer at the <i>Opéra Comique</i>. Nor will this
opinion be contradicted by any of the elegant and pretty women who, slaves to
the custom of shewing themselves at the first representation of a new piece,
never begin to applaud till ELLEVIOU makes his appearance.</p>
<p>This performer is, in fact, gifted with a handsome person, an easy manner,
an expressive countenance, and a voice, which, when he modulates it, is
charming. His delivery is tolerably good, and in some parts, he is not
deficient in warmth and feeling. As a singer, ELLEVIOU leaves behind all those
destined to second him. After having begun by singing bass, he has taken the
parts of counter-tenor, for which, however, his voice is not suited, but he
makes up for this deficiency by a very flexible tenor. He displays much art and
a very modern taste. His method too is good; he makes no improper use of his
facility by lavishing graces, but his manner is too uniform. This is the
greatest objection that can be made to him, in the double capacity of singer
and comedian.</p>
<p>GAVAUDAN. This young actor, with a well-proportioned stature and a very
agreeable countenance, ranks, at the <i>Opéra Comique</i>, next in merit to
ELLEVIOU. His voice, as a counter-tenor, is not very brilliant, nor his means
extensive; but his taste is good, and his method that of the modern school. As
a player, he has a certain repution in lyric <i>drames</i>, and especially in
those melancholy parts, the characteristic of which is a concentrated passion.
He imitates TALMA, and, like him, "outsteps the modesty of Nature."</p>
<p>PHILIPPE. His reputation was begun by the advantages of his person, and he
consolidated it by his performance in the line of knight-errantry. <i>Richard,
c&oelig;ur de lion</i>, was the part which secured him the public favour. His
voice is still an agreeable counter-tenor; but he declines through age. As an
actor, he is deficient in nobleness, and his gestures are not dignified; but,
being used to the stage, and possessing some feeling, he often produces happy
effects.</p>
<p>GAVEAUX. He has been a good singer in his youth, and is a very agreeable
composer. He always acquits himself of any part he undertakes, if not in a
brilliant manner, at least with credit. Two of his musical productions are
stock-pieces, and well worth seeing. <i>L'Amour Filial</i> is a happy imitation
of the Italian school, and <i>Sophie et Moncars</i> is always heard with
pleasure.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Characters of Fathers, Valets, or Comic Parts</i>.<br />
Bass-voices.<br />
CHENARD, MARTIN, RÉZICOURT, JULIET, and MOREAU.</p>
<p>CHENARD. Owing to an advantageous person, this actor once stood as high in
the favour of the ladies as ELLEVIOU does at present. He still possesses a fine
voice, as a bass, but it is not very flexible. In the part of <i>Monsieur de la
France</i>, in <i>l'Épreuve Villageoise</i>, he established his fame as a
singer; yet his style is not sufficiently modelled after the modern taste,
which is the Italian. As an actor, he is very useful; but, having always been
treated by the public like a spoiled child, he is too apt to introduce his own
sallies into his parts, which he sometimes charges with vulgarisms of the
lowest description.</p>
<p>MARTIN. In the parts of valets, MARTIN cannot be better placed than near
ELLEVIOU, whom he seconds with skill and taste. This has led the composers here
to an innovation. Formerly, duets in the graceful style between men were seldom
heard; but the voices of ELLEVIOU and MARTIN being perfectly adapted to each
other, almost all the composers have written for them duets in which the
<i>cantabile</i> prevails, and concerted cadences are very conspicuous. This, I
understand, is unprecedented in Paris.</p>
<p>MARTIN made his <i>début</i> in 1783 at the <i>Théâtre de Monsieur</i> in
the company of Italian buffoons. In this school he acquired that taste which he
has since propagated with zeal, if not with success. At the present day, he is
accused of loading his singing with superfluous embellishments, or of placing
them without judgment in passages or situations where they are ill-suited.
However, in <i>morceaux d'ensemble</i> he is quite at home, and, of course,
shews himself to great advantage. As an actor, he is by no means remarkable,
though he sometimes displays intelligence.</p>
<p>RÉZICOURT. He may justly be called a good comedian, without examining his
merits as a singer.</p>
<p>JULIET. In the newspapers, this performer is called <i>inimitable</i>. His
manner is his own; yet, perhaps, it would be very dangerous to advise any one
to imitate it. He is not deficient in intelligence, and has the habit of the
stage; but his first quality is to be extremely natural, particularly in the
parts of Peasants, which he performs with much truth. He seems to be born a
player, and though he is not a musician, he always sings in tune and in
time.</p>
<p>MOREAU. An agreeable person, open countenance, animation, an ingenuous
manner, and an unerring memory. He is very well placed in young Peasants, such
as <i>Le Bon André</i> and <i>Lubin</i> of FAVART, as well as in the parts of
Valets.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Mixed characters of every sort</i>.&mdash;Tenors.<br />
SOLIÉ, and ST. AUBIN. </p>
<p>SOLIÉ. He first appeared in the parts of young lovers with a tall stature
and a handsome face, but neither of them being fashioned for such characters,
he met with no applause. His voice was not very brilliant, but his method of
singing was replete with grace and taste. For this, however, he obtained no
credit; the Parisian public not being yet accustomed to the modern or Italian
style. CLAIRVAL, the first singer at the old <i>Opéra Comique</i>, happening to
be taken suddenly ill one night, SOLIÉ undertook his part at a moment's
warning. Success crowned his temerity, and from that moment his merit was
appreciated. His best character is <i>Micheli</i> in <i>Les deux Savoyards</i>,
in which he established his reputation. In the pieces of which MÉHUL has
composed the music, he shines by the finished manner in which he executes it;
the <i>cantabile</i> is his fort. As an actor, his declamation is not natural,
and his deportment is too much that of a mannerist. However, these defects are
compensated by his singing. To the music of others, he does every justice, and
that which he composes himself is extremely agreeable.</p>
<p>ST. AUBIN. This performer once had a good voice as a counter-tenor; but as
he now plays no other than secondary parts, one might imagine that he is
retained at the theatre only in consideration of his wife's talents.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Caricatures and Simpletons</i>.<br>
DOZAINVILLE, and LESAGE.</p>
<p>DOZAINVILLE. The person of this actor is very favourable for caricatures and
the characters of simpletons, which he fills. The meagreness of his countenance
renders it very flexible; but not unfrequently he carries this flexibility to
grimace. As a singer, he must not be mentioned.</p>
<p>LESAGE. He is a musician, but has little voice. He performs the parts of
simple peasants in a natural manner, but with too much uniformity. This is is a
general defect attached to those characters.&mdash;Let me next introduce the
female performers. </p>
<p class="center"><i>First female Singers and Parts of Lovers</i>.<br />
Mesdames ST. AUBIN, SCIO, LESAGE, CRÉTU,<br />
PHILIS the elder, GAVAUDAN, and PINGENET.</p>
<p>Madame ST. AUBIN. She is a capital actress, though chiefly in the parts of
young girls; yet she is the main pillar of the <i>Opéra Comique</i>. She never
has been handsome, at least when closely viewed, and is now on the wane, being
turned of forty-five; but her graceful little figure and delicate features make
her appear pretty on the stage. Neatness and <i>naïveté</i> characterise her
acting. She has scarcely any voice, but no other songs than romances or ballads
are assigned to her. She formerly played at the Grand French Opera, where she
was applauded in noble and impassioned parts, though they are not, in general,
suited to her manner. But an actress, high in favour with the public, is always
applauded in whatever character she appears. The pieces in which Madame ST.
AUBIN excels are <i>Le Prisonnier, Adolphe et Clara</i>, and <i>L'Opéra
Comique</i>, which is the title of a piece, as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p>Madame SCIO. Although she is said not to be well versed in music, she has a
very extensive and powerful voice, but its tones have little variety. As an
actress, she is very indifferent. Without being mean, she has no nobleness of
manner. Like almost all the performers belonging to the <i>Opéra Comique</i>,
she delivers ill the dialogue, or such sentences as are not set to music. As
she frequently strains her acting, persons deficient in taste are pleased to
bestow on her the epithet of <i>great</i> as an actress. However, she played
<i>Médée</i> in a lyric tragedy of that name; but such a Medea was never seen!
As a singer, Madame Scio is a valuable acquisition to this theatre. In point of
person, she is neither ordinary nor handsome.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle LESAGE. Her singing is chaste, but destitute of that musical
energy which distinguishes great singers. She plays <i>les ingénuités</i> or
innocent characters; but is rather a mannerist, instead of being childish. She
then employs a false voice, not at all suited to this line of acting, in which
every thing should be natural.</p>
<p>Madame CRÉTU. This actress came to Paris from Bourdeaux, preceded by a great
reputation. She has been handsome: a clear voice, a good method of singing, a
becoming manner of acting, insured her success. She is very useful at this
theatre, in pieces where the <i>vis comica</i> does not predominate.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle PHILIS the elder. This is a pretty pupil of the famous GARAT.
She has a clear pipe, a charming countenance, a quick eye, an agreeable person,
and some taste. <a name="let58fr2"></a>She possesses as much merit as an
actress as a singer.[<a href="#let58f2">2</a>]</p>
<p>Madame GAVAUDAN. She is admired for her pretty person, pretty voice, and
pretty carriage. No wonder then that she has greatly contributed to the success
of the little pieces in the style of <i>Vaudeville</i>, which have been
performed at this theatre.</p>
<p>Mesdemoiselles PINGENET. These two sisters are nothing as actresses; but
seem to aspire to the title of singers, especially the elder, who begins to
distinguish herself.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Noble Mothers and Duennas</i>.<br />
Mesdames DUGAZON, PHILIPPE, and GONTHIER.</p>
<p>Madame DUGAZON. Twenty years ago she enjoyed a great name, for which she was
indebted to the bad taste that then prevailed. With large prominent eyes, and a
broad flat nose, she could not be really handsome; but she had a very animated
countenance. In lyric <i>drames</i>, she personated country-girls,
chambermaids, and princesses. In the first-named cast of parts, she had an
ingenuous, open, but rustic manner. She played chambermaids in a style
bordering on effrontery. Lastly, she represented princesses, but without any
dignity, and also women bereft of their reason. The part in which she had the
most vogue was that of <i>Nina</i> in <i>La Folle par amour</i>. Her madness,
however, appeared not to be occasioned by the sensibility of her heart. It was
too much inclined to the sentimental cast of Sterne's Maria.</p>
<p>Madame DUGAZON, who ought to have been in possession of a considerable
fortune, from the vast sums of money lavished on her by Englishmen, is at this
day reduced to perform the parts of mothers, in which she acquits herself so as
to deserve neither praise nor censure.</p>
<p>Madame PHILIPPE. Under the name of DESFORGES, she shone formerly in the part
of <i>Marguerite</i> in <i>Richard, c&oelig;ur de lion</i>. Without being a
superior singer, she executes her songs with feeling.</p>
<p>Madame GONTHIER. This actress still enjoys the benefit of her former
reputation. She is excellent in a cast of parts become hacknied on the stage;
namely, gossips and nurses.</p>
<p>I have said nothing of the <i>doubles</i> or duplicates of all these ladies,
as they are, in general, bad copies of the originals.</p>
<p>The choruses of the <i>Opéra Comique</i> are not very numerous, and have not
the strength and correctness which distinguish those of the Grand French Opera.
Nor could this be expected. The orchestra has been lately recomposed, and at
present consists of a selection of excellent performers.
<a name="let58fr3"></a>The scenery, decorations, and dresses are deserving of

<h2><a name="let59">LETTER LIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 29, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Whenever the pen of an impartial writer shall trace the history of the
French revolution, through all its accompanying vicissitudes, it will be seen
that this country owed its salvation to the <i>savans</i> or men of science.
The arts and sciences, which were revived by their zeal and courage, united
with unceasing activity to pave the way to victories abroad, and repair
mischiefs at home. Nor can it be denied, that every thing which genius, labour,
and perseverance could create, in point of resources, was employed in such a
manner that France was enabled, by land, to make head against almost all
Europe, and supply her own wants, as long as the war lasted.</p>
<p>The <i>savans</i> who had effected such great things, for some time enjoyed
unlimited influence. It was well known that to them the Republic was indebted
for its safety and very existence. They availed themselves of this favourable
moment for insuring to France that superiority of knowledge which had caused
her to triumph over her enemies. Such was the origin of the</p>
<p class="center">POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL.</p>
<p>This establishment had a triple object; namely, to form engineers for the
different services; to spread in civil society enlightened men, and to excite
talents which might promote the sciences. Nothing was neglected that could tend
to the accomplishment of a destination so important.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, time to reorganize the instruction of corps destined for
public services, the greater part of which were wholly deficient in this
respect. Some of them, it is true, had particular schools; but instruction
there was feeble and incomplete. That for military engineers at
<i>Mézieres</i>, the best conducted of all, and which admitted twenty pupils
only, had suspended its exercises, in consequence of the revolution. Necessity
had occasioned the formation of a provisionary school, where the pupils
received rapidly the first notions of the attack and defence of places, after
which they were sent to the armies.</p>
<p>Such institutions neither answered the exigencies of the State, nor conduced
to its glory. Their weakness was, above all, likely to be felt by men
habituated to general ideas, and whose minds were still more exalted, and views
enlarged, by the revolution. Those men wished that the new <i>School for Public
Works</i> should be worthy of the nation. Their plan was extensive in its
object, but simple in its execution, and certain in its results.</p>
<p>The first law concerning the <i>Central School for Public Works</i>, since
called the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, was made on the 20th of Ventôse year II.
(10th of March 1794). From that moment, much zeal was manifested in making the
necessary arrangements for its formation. On the report made to the National
Convention respecting the measures taken on this subject, on the 7th of
Vendémiaire year III (28th of September 1794) a decree was passed, directing a
competition to be opened for the admission of four hundred pupils into this
school. The examination was appointed to take place in twenty-two of the
principal towns. The candidates were to answer in arithmetic and the elements
of algebra and geometry. Those admitted received the allowance of military
officers for their travelling expenses to Paris. They were to have annually
twelve hundred francs, and to remain in the school three years, after which
they were to be called to the different Public Services, when they were judged
capable of performing them; and priority was to depend on merit. These services
were the duty of military engineers, naval engineers, or ship-builders,
artillerists, both military and naval, engineers of bridges and highways,
geographical engineers, and engineers of mines, and to them were added the
service of the pupils of the school of aërostation, which GUYTON MORVEAU had
caused to be established at Meudon, for the purpose of forming the aërostatic
company destined for man&oelig;uvring air-balloons, applied to the art of war,
as was seen at <i>Maubeuge</i>, <i>Fleurus</i>, <i>Aix-la-Chapelle</i>,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>However, the conception of this project was far more easy than its
execution. It was doing little to choose professors from among the first men of
science in Europe, if their lessons were not fixed in the mind of the pupils.
Being unable to communicate them to each pupil in private, they stood in need
of agents who should transmit them to this numerous assemblage of youth, and
be, as it were, the nerves of the body. To form these was the first object.</p>
<p>Among the young men who had presented themselves at the competition, twenty
of the most distinguished were selected. Philosophical instruments and a
chemical laboratory were provided for them, and they were unremittingly
exercised in every part of the plan which it was resolved to execute. These
pupils, the greater part of whom had come from the schools for Public Service,
felt the insufficiency of the instruction which they had there received. Eager
to learn, their mind became inflamed by the presence of the celebrated men who
were incessantly with them. The days sufficed not for their zeal; and in three
months they were capable of discharging the functions for which they were
intended.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. At a time when opinion and power might change from one
moment to another, much risk was incurred if a definitive form was not at once
given to the <i>Polytechnic School</i>. The authors of this vast project had
seen the revolution too near not to be sensible of that truth. But they wished
first, by a trial made on a grand scale, to insure their method, class the
pupils, and shew what might be expected from them. They therefore developed to
them, in rapid lectures, the general plan of instruction. </p>
<p>This plan had been drawn up agreeably to the views of men the best informed,
amongst whom MONGE must be particularly mentioned. He had been professor at
<i>Mezières</i>, and had there given the first lessons of descriptive geometry,
that science so useful to the engineer. The enumeration of the various parts of
instruction was reduced to a table, printed by order of the Committee of Public
Safety. It comprehends mathematics, analysis applied to descriptive geometry
and to the mechanism of solids and fluids, stereotomy, drawing, civil
architecture, fortification, general physics, chymistry, mineralogy, and their
application to the arts.</p>
<p>In three months, the work of three years was explained. A real enthusiasm
was excited in these youths on finding themselves occupied by the sublimest
ideas which had employed the mind of man. Amidst the divisions and animosities
of political party, it was an interesting sight, to behold four hundred young
men, full of confidence and friendship, listening with profound attention to
the lectures of the celebrated <i>savans</i> who had been spared by the
guillotine. </p>
<p>The results of so great an experiment surpassed the most sanguine
expectations. After this preliminary instruction, the pupils were divided into
brigades, and education took the course it was intended should follow.</p>
<p>What particularly distinguishes this establishment, is that the pupils not
only receive oral lessons, but they must give in written solutions, present
drawings, models, or plans for the different parts, and themselves operate in
the laboratories. </p>
<p>On the 1st of Germinal year III (22d of March 1795) the annual courses were
commenced. They were then distributed for three years, but at this day they
last two only. At the same time a decree was passed, regulating the number of
professors, adjuncts, ushers, the holding of the meetings of the council of
instruction and administration, the functions of the director, administrator,
inspector of the studies, secretary of the council, librarian, keepers of the
collection of drawings, models, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Since that epoch, the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, often attacked, even in the
discussions of the <i>Legislative Body</i>, has maintained its ground by the
impression of the reputation of the men who act there as professors, of the
depth of the knowledge which makes the object of their lessons, and of the
youths of superior talent who issue from it every year. The law which after
many adjournments, has fixed its existence is dated the 25th of Frimaire year
VIII (16th of December 1799.)</p>
<p>The most important changes introduced, are the determination of the age to
be received into this school, which is from sixteen to twenty, the reduction of
the pupils to the number of three hundred, the rank which is given them of
serjeant of artillery of the first class, their pay fixed on the same footing,
together with a fund of assistance for those labouring under difficulties, the
obligation to wear a uniform, the establishment of a council of improvement,
composed of three members of the National Institute, of examiners, of a
general-officer or superior agent of each of the branches of the Public
Service, of the director, and four commissioners taken from the council of
instruction.</p>
<p>This council assembles every year, inquires into the state of the school,
proposes its views of amelioration, respecting every department, and makes a
report to the government. One of its principal functions is to harmonise the
instruction with that of the Schools of Engineers, Artillery, &amp;c. into
which the pupils enter after the final examination they undergo previously to
their departure.</p>
<p>After this, to judge of the advantages of the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, it
is sufficient to cast an eye on the printed reports, which present an account
of the persons it furnishes to the different services, of those who have been
taken from it for the expedition to Egypt, for the corps of <i>aspirans de la
marine</i> or midshipmen, for entering into the line vith the rank of officers,
or into the department of commissaries of war, (into which they are admitted
after their examination if no places are vacant in the Schools for Public
Service), of those who have been called on to profess the sciences in the
central schools (Lyceums) of the departments, some to fill the first
professors' chairs in Paris, such as at the <i>Collège de France</i> and the
<i>École Polytechnique</i>, of those, in short, who have quitted this school to
introduce into the manufactories the knowledge which they had acquired. The
last-mentioned circumstance has always been a consideration for carrying the
number of pupils beyond the presumable wants of the different Public
Services.</p>
<p>You see that this is no more than a summary  of what might be said and
collected from the journals of the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, (which already
form four volumes in 4to. independently of the classic works published by the
professors), for giving a complete history of this interesting establishment,
which attracts the notice of foreigners of all nations. BONAPARTE takes no
small interest in the labours of the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, and has often
said that it would be difficult to calculate the effects of the impulse which
it has given towards the mathematical sciences, and of the aggregate of the
knowledge imparted to the pupils.</p>
<p>The <i>Polytechnic School</i>, which is under the authority of the Minister
of the Interior, occupies an extensive range of building, formerly known by the
name of <i>Le petit Palais Bourbon</i>, contiguous to the <i>Palais du Corps
Legislatif</i>. The different apartments contain every thing necessary for the
elucidation of the arts and sciences here taught; but the pupils reside not at
the school: they lodge and board with their friends, on the salary allowed them
by the nation, and repair thither only for the prosecution of their
studies.</p>
<h2><a name="let60">LETTER LX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, January 30, 1802.</i></p>
<p>To judge from the records of the Old Bailey, one would conclude that, in
proportion to the number of its inhabitants, London must contain a greater
number of dishonest persons of both sexes than any metropolis in Europe. But,
though more notorious thieves and daring robbers may perhaps, be found in
London than in many other great cities, yet I will venture to affirm that Paris
contains more</p>
<p class="center">PICKPOCKETS AND SHARPERS.</p>
<p>However superior too our rogues may be in boldness, I apprehend that, in
dexterity, they are far inferior to those to be met with among our neighbours.
To elude a more vigilant inspection, the latter are compelled to exert more art
and cunning. In this dissipated capital, which is a grand theatre where they
can display all their talent, and find a greater number of dupes, adventurers
and swindlers of every description have long been famous; but it should seem
that the females here of that stamp deserve to be no less celebrated.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, I heard of an English lady of quality being detected in
the very act of secreting a quantity of valuable lace, to which she had taken a
particular fancy at a great haberdasher's in Pall-Mall. It was said that she
endeavoured to exculpate herself for this inadvertency on the ground of being
in a pregnant state, which had produced an irrisistible longing. However this
may be, she might here have got a lesson, as will appear from the following
instance of ingenuity very lately practised by one of her own sex.</p>
<p>In the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i>, a haberdasher of note keeps a shop
where the highest-priced articles of female wear are exhibited, immediately on
coming from the hands of the manufacturer or inventor. The other day, a lady
somewhat turned of thirty, of genteel appearance and engaging address, entered
this shop, and asked to see some white lace veils. Several were shewn to her at
the price of from twenty-five to fifty louis each. These not being sufficiently
rich to please her taste, others more costly were produced, and she fixed on
one of eighty louis in value. Standing before a glass, she immediately put on
this veil <i>à la réligieuse</i>, that is, in the form of the hood of a nun's
dress. Then taking from her bosom her little purse, she found it to contain no
more than twenty louis in bankpaper, which she paid to the haberdasher as a
deposit for the veil, at the same time desiring him to send one of his men with
her to her <i>homme d'affaires</i> or agent, in order that he might bring back
the other sixty.</p>
<p>As a Parisian tradesman is always extremely glad to get rid of his goods,
she had no difficulty in carrying her point; and, having selected from among
the shopmen a shamefaced youth of eighteen, took him with her in the
hackney-coach which she had kept in waiting. She gave the coachman her orders,
and away he drove to a famous apothecary's, in the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i>.
"This," said she to the shopman, "is the residence of my <i>homme
d'affaires</i>: follow me, and you shall have your money." She accordingly
alighted, and, after saying a few words in the ear of the doctor, on whose
credulity she had already exercised her genius, desired him to take the young
man to his private room, and settle the business, while she remained to chat
with his wife.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting youth, seeing the lady on such terms of intimacy in the
family, made no hesitation to follow the doctor to a back-parlour, where, to
his extreme surprise, he was closely questioned as to his present state of
health, and the rise and progress of the disorder which he had caught through
his own imprudence. The more he denied the circumstance, the more the doctor
persisted in his endeavours to procure ocular demonstration. The latter had
previously locked the door, having been apprized by the lady that her son was
exceedingly bashful, and that stratagem, and even a certain degree of violence,
perhaps, must be employed to obtain evidence of a complaint, which, as it
injured her <i>dear boy's</i> constitution, disturbed her own happiness and
peace of mind. The doctor was proceeding to act on this information, when the
young shopman, finding his retreat cut off, vociferously demanded the sixty
louis which he was come to receive in payment for the veil. "Sixty louis in
payment for a veil!" re-echoed the doctor. "Your mother begged me to examine
you for a complaint which you have inconsiderately contracted in the pursuit of
pleasure." The <i>dénouement</i> now taking place, the two dupes hastened back
to the shop, when they found that the lady had decamped, having previously
discharged the coach, in order that she might not be traced by the number.</p>
<p>The art of purloining a watch, a snuff-box, or a purse, unperceived by the
owner, may, no doubt, be acquired by constant practice, till the novice becomes
expert in his profession: but the admirable presence of mind displayed by
Parisian sharpers must, in a great measure, be inherited from nature. What can
well surpass an example of this kind mentioned by a celebrated French
writer?</p>
<p>A certain person who had been to receive a sum of money at a banker's, was
returning home with it in a hired carriage. The coachman, not remembering the
name of the street whither he had been ordered to drive, got off his box, and
opened the coach-door to ask it. He found the person dead and cold. At his
first exclamation, several people collected. A sharper who was passing by,
suddenly forced his way through the crowd, and, in a lamentable and pathetic
voice, called out: "'Tis my father! What a miserable wretch am I!" Then,
exhibiting every mark of the most poignant grief, he got into the coach, and,
crying and sobbing, kissed the dead man's face. The bystanders were affected,
and dispersed, saying, one to another, "What an affectionate son!" The sharper
drove on in the coach, where he found the bags of money, which were an
unexpected booty, and, stopping it at a door, told the coachman that he wished
to apprize his sister of the melancholy accident that had just happened. He
alighted, and shut the coach-door, leaving the corpse as naked as it came into
the world. The coachman, having waited a long time, inquired in vain at the
house for the young man and his sister; no one had any knowledge of her, him,
or the deceased.</p>
<p>I remember when I was last in Paris, at the beginning of the revolution,
being shewn a silversmith's shop, whence a few articles having been stolen, the
master was induced to examine in what manner the thieves gained admittance.
Discovering an aperture where he conjectured that a man's hand might be
introduced, he prepared a noose with a proper cord, and remained in waiting the
following night to see if they would repeat their visit. At a late hour, when
all was quiet, he perceived a man's hand thrust through the aperture; instantly
he drew tight the noose, and thought he had effectually secured the culprit;
but he was mistaken. The fellow's accomplices, fearing that the apprehension of
one of them would lead to the discovery of all, on finding it impossible to
extricate him by any other means, cut off his wrist. When the patrole arrived
at the spot, on the call of the silversmith, he was not a little astonished to
find that his prisoner had escaped, though with the loss of a hand, which
remained fast in the noose.</p>
<p>With respect to these more daring classes of rogues, every year almost
produces some new race of them. Since the revolution, the criminal code having
condemned to death none but those guilty of murder, housebreakers, to avoid the
penalty of the law, had recourse to a practice, which put the persons whom they
subjected to it to the most severe pain. This was to hold their feet to the
fire till they declared where all their moveable property was to be found.
Hence these villains obtained the name of <i>chauffeurs</i>. Notwithstanding
the vigilance of the Police, they still occasionally exercise their cruelties
in some of the departments, as may be seen by the proceedings of the criminal
tribunals. I have also heard of another species of assassins, who trained
blood-hounds to seize a man by the throat in certain solitary places, and then
came afterwards, and plundered him at their ease. When apprehended, they coolly
said: "We did not kill the man, but found him dead."</p>
<p>As in former times, all sentences passed on criminals, tried in Paris,
whether condemned to die or not, are put into execution on the</p>
<p class="center">PLACE DE GRÈVE.</p>
<p>The first sentence executed here was that passed on <i>Marguerite
Porette</i>, a female heretic, who was burnt alive in the year 1310.</p>
<p>Among the punishments which it has been found necessary to re-establish is
that of marking with a hot iron. Criminals, condemned to imprisonment in irons,
are exposed for two hours on a scaffold in the middle of this square. They are
seated and tied to a post, having above them a label with the words of their
sentence. They are clad in woollen pantaloons and a waistcoat with sleeves, one
half of each of which is white; the other, brown. After being exposed two
hours, they are stripped, and to their shoulder is applied a hot iron, which
there leaves the impression of the letter V, for <i>voleur</i>, thief. Women,
not being condemned to imprisonment in irons; are exempt from the penalty of
being marked. This punishment is said to produce considerable effect on the
culprits, as well as on the spectators. Previously to its being revived,
persons convicted of thieving were insolent beyond all endurance.</p>
<p>The <i>Place de Grève</i> is a parallelogram, one of the long sides of which
is occupied by the <i>ci-devant Hôtel de Ville</i>, a tasteless edifice, begun
in 1533, but not finished till 1605.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the <i>Place de Grève</i> was alternately the theatre
of punishments and rejoicings. On the same pavement, where scaffolds were
erected for the execution of criminals, rose superb edifices for public
festivals.</p>
<p>Here, when any criminal of note was to suffer, the occupiers of the
adjoining houses made a rich harvest by letting their apartments. Every window
that commanded a view of the horrid scene, was then hired at a most exorbitant
price. Women of the first rank and fashion, decked in all the luxury of dress,
graced even the uppermost stories. These weak-nerved females, who would have
fainted at the sight of a spider mangling a fly, stood crowded together, calmly
viewing the agonies of an expiring malefactor, who, after having been racked on
the wheel, was, perhaps, denied the <i>coup de grace</i> which would, in an
instant, have rid him of his miserable existence.</p>
<p>The death of a regicide was a sort of gala to these belles; while the lead
was melting over the furnace, the iron pinchers heating in the fire, and the
horses disposed for tearing asunder the four quarters of the victim of the
laws, some of them amused themselves with an innocent game at cards, in sight
of all these terrible preparations, from which a man of ordinary feeling would
avert his looks with horror.</p>
<p>How happens it that, in all countries on the continent, ladies flock to
these odious spectacles? Every where, I believe, the populace run to behold
them; but that a female of superior birth and breeding can deliberately seek so
inhuman a gratification is a mystery which I cannot explain, unless, indeed, on
the principle of shewing themselves, as well as that of seeing the show.</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsæ</i>."</p>
<h2><a name="let61">LETTER LXI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 2, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Independently of the general organization of Public Instruction, according
to the new plan, of which I have before traced you the leading features, there
exist several schools appropriate to different professions, solely devoted to
the Public Service, and which require particular knowledge in the arts and
sciences. Hence they bear the generic name of</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOLS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES.</p>
<p>They are comprised under the following denominations.</p>
<table summary="paris"  align="center">
<tr><td colspan="2">POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCHOOL OF</td><td>ARTILLERY.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>MILITARY ENGINEERS.</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>NAVIGATION.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In order to be admitted into any of the above schools, the candidates must
prove themselves qualified by the preliminary instruction required the
examinations at the competition prescribed for each of them. The pupils of
these schools receive a salary from the nation. At the head of them is the
<i>Polytechnic School</i>, of which I have already spoken. This is the grand
nursery, whence the pupils, when they have attained a sufficient degree of
perfection, are transplanted into the other <i>Schools for Public Services</i>.
Next come the</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOLS OF ARTILLERY.</p>
<p>There are eight of these in the places where the regiments of artillery are
garrisoned. The pupils who are sent thither as officers, after having been
examined, apply their knowledge to the arts, to the construction of works, and
to the man&oelig;uvres of war dependent on artillery. Each school, in which the
pupils must remain two years longer, is under the superintendance of a general
of brigade of the corps.</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL OF MILITARY ENGINEERS.</p>
<p>This school, united to that of Miners, is established at Metz. Its labours
relate to the application of the theoretical knowledge which the pupils have
imbibed at the <i>Polytechnic School</i>. The objects of these labours is the
construction of all sorts of works of fortification, mines and counter-mines,
mock-representations of sieges, attack, and defence, the drawing of plans and
military surveys, in a word, all the details of the duty of engineers in
fortified places and in the field.</p>
<p>The number of pupils is limited to twenty. They have the rank and pay of
second lieutenant. The School of Engineers, as well as the Schools of
Artillery, is under the authority of the Minister at War.</p>
<p>Much as I wish to compress my subject, I must observe that, previously to
leaving the school, the pupils undergo a strict examination respecting the
objects of instruction before-enumerated. This examination is intrusted to a
<i>jury</i> (as the French term it) composed of the commander in chief of the
school, a general or field-officer of the corps, appointed every year by the
Minister at War, and one of the permanent examiners of the Polytechnic School.
<i>This jury forms the list of merit, which regulates the order of
promotion.</i> Can we then wonder that the French have the first military
engineers in Europe?</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL OF BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1787, by TRUDAINE, and continued under the direction of
PERRONET, chief engineer of this corps, till his death, which happened in 1794.
He was then 86 years of age. By his will, he bequeathed to this school, for the
instruction of the pupils whom he loved as his children, his library, his
models, his manuscripts, and his portfolios; articles which at this day form an
invaluable collection.</p>
<p>This school, which is at present established in the <i>Hôtel de Chatelet</i>
(formerly belonging to the duke of that name) <i>Rue de Grenelle</i>, <i>St.
Germain</i>, unites the <i>dépôt</i> or repository of plans and models to the
labours relating to roads, canals, and harbours for trade. The number of pupils
admitted is fifty. They are taken from the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, and
retain the salary which they there received.</p>
<p>The instruction given to them chiefly consists in the application of the
principles of physics and mathematics to the art of planning and constructing
works relative to roads, canals, and sea-ports, and the buildings belonging
thereto; the means of execution, and the mode of forming plans and estimates of
the works to be executed, and the order to be observed in keeping the
accounts.</p>
<p>The <i>School of Bridges and Highways</i> is under the authority of the
Minister of the Interior,</p>
<p class="center">PRACTICAL SCHOOLS OF MINES.</p>
<p>One of these schools is established at Geislautern, in the department of La
Sarre; and the other, at Pesay, in the department of Mont-Blanc.</p>
<p>The Director and Professors form a committee for the working of the mines of
Pesay, as well as for the instruction of the pupils. In consequence of the
report of this committee the <i>Council of Mines</i> established in Paris,
proposes to the government the measures necessary to be adopted. Twenty pupils,
who have passed their examination at the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, are
attached to the practical schools, for the purpose of applying the theoretical
part of their instruction. Extra-scholars, with testimonials of good behaviour
and capacity, are admitted to be educated at their own expense. These schools
are also under the authority of the Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL OF NAVAL ENGINEERS.</p>
<p>The <i>School of Naval Architects</i>, which existed in Paris, has been
removed to Brest, under the name of <i>École des Ingénieurs des Vaisseaux</i>.
No pupils are admitted but such as have been students, at least two years, in
the <i>Polytechnic School</i>. The examination of the candidates takes place
every year, and the preference is given to those who excel in descriptive
geometry, mechanics, and the other branches of knowledge appropriated to the
first year's study at that school. When the pupils have proved, in the repeated
examinations which they must undergo, that they are sufficiently qualified,
they are sent to Brest (as vacancies occur), in order to apply the theory they
have acquired to the different works carried on in that port, where they find
both the example and the precept, and are taught every thing relative to the
construction of ships of war and merchant-vessels.</p>
<p>This school is under the authority of the Minister of the naval department.
The pupils admitted into it, receive a salary of 1800 francs (<i>circa</i> £.
75 sterling) a year.</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOLS OF NAVIGATION.</p>
<p>The Schools of Mathematics and Hydrography, established for the navy of the
State, and the Schools of Hydrography destined for the merchant-service, bear
the name of <i>Écoles de Navigation</i>.</p>
<p>Every year, there is a competition for the admission of candidates for naval
employment. The Hydrographical Examiner makes a general tour to the different
ports, where he interrogates the pupils in arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
statics, and navigation. According to these examinations, they are admitted to
the rank of <i>aspirons de marine</i> or midshipmen, captains of merchant-ships
for long voyages, masters of coasting-vessels, pilots, &amp;c,</p>
<p>By a late decree of the Consuls, no one can be admitted to the examination
prescribed for being received as master in the coasting-trade, unless he is
twenty-four years of age, and has served five years on board the ships of war
belonging to the Republic.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>In my letter of the 15th of January, I have shewn you that Public
Instruction is to be divided into four classes: 1. In Primary Schools,
established by the <i>Communes</i>. 2. In Secondary Schools, established by the
<i>Communes</i>, and kept by private masters. 3. In Lyceums. 4. In <i>Special
Schools</i>. In the two last-mentioned establishments, the pupils are to be
maintained at the expense of the nation.</p>
<p>Before I particularize the <i>Special Schools</i>, I must mention a national
institution, distinguished by the appellation of</p>
<p class="center">PRYTANÉE FRANÇAIS.</p>
<p>It is divided into four colleges, established at Paris, St. Cyr, St.
Germain-en-Laye, and Compiegne. It was destined for the gratuitous education of
the children of the military killed in the field of honour, and of public
functionaries who might happen to die in the discharge of their office.</p>
<p>By a decree of the Consuls, dated the 1st of Germinal year VIII (22nd of
March 1800) the number of pupils, in each of the Colleges of Paris, St. Cyr,
and St. Germain-en-Laye, is limited to two hundred, and to three hundred, in
that of Compiegne. An augmentation, however, is to be made in favour of the new
departments. The pupils are named by the First Consul. On entering the College,
they bring a stated proportion of necessaries, after which they are wholly
maintained at the expense of the nation till they have finished their studies.
The government provides for the advancement of those who give the greatest
proof of good conduct and talent. The pupils cannot remain in either of these
four colleges beyond the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>As I have before observed, the Central Schools are, in future, to bear the
name of Lyceums, and the highest degree of public instruction is to be acquired
in the</p>
<p class="center">SPECIAL SCHOOLS.</p>
<p>In these upper schools are to be particularly taught, in the most profound
manner, the useful sciences, together with jurisprudence, medicine, natural
history, &amp;c. The Special Schools now in existence are to be continued,
subject to such modifications as the government may think fit to introduce for
the benefit of the Public Service. They are still under the immediate
superintendance of the Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p>The <i>Collège de France</i> I have before described: the Museum of Natural
History, the Special School of docimastic Mineralogy and Chemistry, and that
for Oriental languages, I shall speak of elsewhere; but I shall now proceed to
give you a rapid sketch of the others which I have not yet noticed, beginning
with the</p>
<p class="center">SPECIAL SCHOOL OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.</p>
<p>This institution was founded in 1648, at the instigation of LE BRUN. It was
formerly held in the <i>Place du Louvre</i>, but is now removed to the
<i>ci-devant Collège des Quatre-Nations</i>, which has taken the name of
<i>Palais des Beaux Arts</i>. This is the only school in Paris that has never
indulged in any vacation. Each professor is on duty for two months. During the
first month, he gives his lessons in the school of living models; during the
other, in the school of the antique, called, <i>la bosse</i>. It may not be
uninteresting to give you an idea of the</p>
<p class="center">COMPETITIONS.</p>
<p>Every year there is a competition in Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture,
which is to be called <i>National Prize</i>. Its object is to confer on those
who have gained the first prize, at present proposed by the Institute, the
advantage of an allowance of 1200 francs for five years, which is insured to
them at the French School of Fine Arts at Rome. During their stay there, they
are lodged, boarded, and taken care of, in case of illness, at the expense of
the Republic.</p>
<p>A competition takes place every six months for the rank of places in the
schools; and another, every three months for the distribution of medals.</p>
<p>There is also a prize, of 100 francs, founded by M. DE CAYLUS, for a head
expressive of character, painted or drawn from nature; and another prize of 300
francs, founded by LATOUR, for a half-length, painted after a model, and of the
natural size.</p>
<p>Independently of the competition of the school, there is every year a
general competition followed by a distribution of the works of encouragement,
granted to the artists who have distinguished themselves most in the annual
exhibition of the <i>Salon du Louvre</i>. A jury, named by the competitors
themselves, examines the different pictures, classes them according to the
degree of merit which it finds they possess, and the Minister of the Interior
allots to each of the artists <i>crowned</i> a sum in payment of a new work
which they are bound to furnish to the government.</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE.</p>
<p>In this school, which is held in the <i>Louvre</i>, the Professor of
Architecture delivers lectures on the history of that art, and the theory of
its different branches, on the orders, and edifices erected by the ancients,
and on the works of Vitruvius, Palladio, Scamozzi, and Vignole. He takes no
small pains to make known the bold style of Grecian architecture, which the
Athenians chiefly employed during the ages when they prided themselves on being
a free people.</p>
<p>The Professor of Mathematics explains the principles of arithmetic and
elementary geometry, which he applies to the different branches of civil and
military architecture, such as levelling, the art of constructing plans, and
perspective.</p>
<p>The Professor of Stereotomy, in his lectures, chiefly comprises masonry and
carpentry; he points out the best methods of employing those arts in civil and
military buildings. His demonstrations relate to the theoretical and practical
part of both branches. All the pupils, and students of architecture are
indiscriminately admitted to the competition for the great prize of
architecture, provided they are not foreigners.</p>
<p class="center">CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.</p>
<p>This establishment, situated in the <i>Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière</i>, was
founded on the 16th of Thermidor year III, (4th of August 1795) for the
preservation and reproduction of music in all its branches.</p>
<p>It is composed of a director, three inspectors of teaching, a secretary, a
librarian, and thirty-five professors.</p>
<p>The director presides over the whole establishment; the inspectors
superintend the teaching, examine the pupils, and teach the branches of study
attributed to them by the regulation.</p>
<p>In the Conservatory, the instruction is divided as follows: composition,
harmony, solfaing, singing, violin, violincello, harpsicord, organ, flute,
hautboy, clarinette, French-horn, bassoon, trumpet, trombonne, serpent,
preparation for singing, and declamation applicable to the lyric stage.</p>
<p>The completion of the study is effected by a series of lectures, treating
specially of the relations between the sciences and the art of music.</p>
<p>Three hundred pupils of both sexes, taken in equal number from each
department, are instructed gratuitously in the Conservatory. The principal
points towards which their studies are directed, are, to keep up music in
society, to form artists for the execution of public <i>fêtes</i>, for the
armies, and for the theatres.</p>
<p>These pupils are admitted after an examination, which takes place four times
a year. Prizes are distributed annually, in a public meeting of the
Conservatory, to the pupils who distinguish themselves in each branch of
study.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p /><p class="right"><i>February 2, in continuation.</i></p>
<p>To the preceding brief account of the Conservatory, I shall subjoin a few
observations on the</p>
<p class="center">PRESENT STATE OF MUSIC IN FRANCE.</p>
<p>Till the year 1789, this was the country where the greatest expense was
incurred in cultivating music; yet the means which were employed, though very
numerous, produced but little effect, and contributed not to the improvement of
that art. Every thing even announces that its progress would have been still
more retarded, but for the introduction of the Italian Opera, in 1645, by
Cardinal Mazarin.</p>
<p>The brilliant success of <i>Orfeo e Euridice</i>, in 1647, determined the
national taste in favour of this sort of <i>spectacle</i>, and gave birth to
the wish of transplanting it to the French stage. It was in 1659 that the first
opera, with music adapted to a French poem, was performed at Issy.</p>
<p>Since the epoch of the establishment of the French opera, every department
belonging to it, with the sole exception of the singing, has been so much
improved, that it is become the most brilliant <i>spectacle</i> in Europe. But,
as the lyric theatres in France were always obliged to seek recruits among the
pupils formed in the schools maintained by the clergy for the service of public
worship, the influence of the clerical mode of instruction was felt; and this
was, in fact, the source of the bad taste which for a long time characterized
French singing.</p>
<p>Had the grand opera in France been continued an Italian one, as it was first
established, (like those subsequently introduced in the principal cities of
Europe) it would have been supported by performers formed by the Conservatories
of Italy; and the good taste of those schools would have balanced or proscribed
the bad taste of the French cathedrals; but the genius of the seventeenth
century chose that the French language, purified and fixed by the writers who
rendered it illustrious, should also become the language of the lyric theatre.
Musical instruction, remaining entirely subservient to the customs of religion,
was unable to keep pace with the rapid progress of the arts and sciences during
that brilliant period.</p>
<p>Among the defects of the old system of teaching music, must be placed that
of confining it to men; nevertheless, the utility of women in concerts and
plays was as incontestable then as it is at the present day. Public instruction
was therefore due to them in that point of view; but, had no such consideration
existed, they should have been admitted to participate in this instruction, in
order to propagate the art in society. The success of this method would have
been infallible: as soon as women should have cultivated the musical art with
success, its naturalization would have been effected in France, as it has been
in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The expense of the musical instruction pursued in the schools belonging to
the cathedrals was immense, compared with its results in every branch of the
art. As to composers, they produced but a very small number, and few of these
distinguished themselves; no instrumental performer of eminence ever issued
from them; and, with few exceptions, the singers they formed were very
indifferent.</p>
<p>The necessity of introducing a better method of singing induced the
government, in 1783, to establish a <i>Special School of Singing and
Declamation.</i> This institution continued in full exercise for ten years;
but, though the celebrated PICCINI was appointed to preside over the vocal
department, the habits of the old school obstructed its progress, and prevented
it from producing the good which was expected from it.</p>
<p>At the epoch of the dissolution of the monarchical institutions, there
remained in France only the School of Music of the Parisian national guard, and
that of Singing and Declamation just mentioned. The republican government
ordered them to be united, and thus was formed the <i>Conservatory of
Music</i>.</p>
<p>Nor let it be imagined that policy has had no share in establishing this
institution. It has furnished the numerous bands of musicians rendered
necessary by the levy of fourteen armies which France had, at one and the same
time, in the field. It is well known that music has done almost wonders in
reviving the courage of the French soldiers, who, when Victory seemed adverse
to them, inclined her in their favour, by rallying to the tune of the
<i>Marseillois</i>. In the heat of action, joining their voice to the
instruments, and raising themselves to a pitch of enthusiasm, they received or
dealt out death, while they kept singing this hymn. The French then are no less
indebted to ROUGET DE LILLE than the Spartans were to TYRTÆUS. At the beginning
of the revolution, they had no songs of the warlike kind, except a few paltry
ballads sung about the streets. ROUGET, who was then an officer of engineers at
Strasburg, was requested to compose a martial hymn. Full of poetic fire, he
shut himself up in his chamber, and, in the course of one night, wrote the
words of the <i>Marseillois</i>, adapting to them music, also of his own
composition. Notwithstanding this patriotic production, and the courage which
the author is said to have displayed during the war, he was twice imprisoned,
at one time on suspicion of royalism; at another, of terrorism.</p>
<p><a name="let61fr1"></a>Independently of the great number of musicians with
which the Conservatory has supplied the armies, it has furnished between two
and three hundred to the theatres, as well in Paris as in the
departments.[<a href="#let61f1">1</a>] The band of the Consular guard was
formed from the pupils of the Conservatory, and sixty of them at present
compose the orchestra, known in Paris by the name of <i>Concert Français</i>,
and the execution of which has been much applauded by many celebrated
composers.</p>
<p>Its members meet to discuss the theories which may improve and extend the
different branches of the musical art. They have already laid the principal
foundations of a body of elementary works for teaching them in perfection.
<i>Les Principes élementaires de Musique</i>, and a <i>Traité d'Harmonie</i>,
which is said to have gained the universal approbation of the composers of the
three schools, assembled to discuss its merits, are already published. A method
of singing, established on the best principles of the Italian school, applied
to French declamation, is now in the press; and these publications are to be
successively followed by other didactic works relative to the history of the
art.</p>
<p>A principal cause of the present scarcity of fine voices in France, is the
war which she has had to maintain for ten years, by armies continually
recruited by young men put in requisition at the period when the voice is
forming, and needs to be cultivated in order to acquire the qualities which
constitute a good singer.</p>
<p>Formerly, French commerce derived but very little advantage from articles
relating to music; but the means employed by the Conservatory may probably turn
the scale in favour of this country, as well as render it, in that respect,
independent of foreign nations.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, England furnished France with <i>piano-fortes</i>,
the common price of which was from three to five hundred francs. Germany mostly
supplied her with wind and string instruments. German French-horns, though
coarsely-made instruments, cost seventy-two francs, and the good violins of the
Tyrol were paid for as high as one hundred and twenty. The consumption of these
instruments was considerable. Nor will this appear surprising, as previously to
the foundation of the Conservatory, the instrumental musicians, employed in the
French regiments and places of public amusement, were mostly Germans.</p>
<p>The French <i>piano-fortes</i> are now in request in most parts of Europe,
and their price has, in consequence, increased from one thousand to two
thousand four hundred francs. The price of French-horns, made in Paris, which,
from being better finished, are preferable to those of Germany, has, in like
manner, risen from three to five hundred francs. Parisian violins have
increased in proportion.</p>
<p>With respect to printed music, the French import none; but, on the contrary,
export a great deal; and the advantages resulting from these two branches of
commerce, together with the stamp-duty attached to the latter, are said to be
sufficient to defray the expenses of the musical establishments now existing,
or those proposed to be created.</p>
<p>Before I close this letter, I must not omit to mention a very useful
institution, for the promotion  of the mechanical arts, established in the
<i>Rue de l'École de Médecine</i>, and called the</p>
<p class="center">GRATUITOUS SCHOOL FOR DRAWING.</p>
<p>It was founded in the year 1766, for the instruction of fifteen hundred
children intended for mechanical professions, and was the first beneficent
establishment opened in favour of the common people. Literature, sciences, and
liberal arts had every where public schools; mechanical arts alone were
neglected. The lower orders, by whom they were exercised, had no other means of
learning them, and of developing the faculties of their mind, than the blind
routine of apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The success of this school had progressively caused similar ones to be
instituted in a great number of towns of France, but most of them are buried
under the ruins of the revolution; that of Paris has escaped the general
overthrow; and, though it has lost a considerable portion of its revenue, it
still admits about six hundred pupils. They are taught every thing relative to
the mechanical arts, such as drawing in all its various branches, military,
civil, and naval architecture, hydraulics, arithmetic, land-surveying,
mensuration, perspective, stone-cutting, and in short such parts of mathematics
and practical geometry as relate to those different objects.</p>
<p>The Gratuitous School for Drawing must not be assimilated to establishments
intended for improving the taste of those who follow the career of the liberal
arts. It presents immediately to the children of the lower orders of the people
the instruction that suits them best. Here, every thing is useful. Not only are
the pupils instructed <i>gratis</i>, but the school furnishes to the indigent,
recommended by one of the founders, the paper, pencils, and instruments
necessary for their studies in the classes, and also models for exercising
their talents at home.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>I shall speak elsewhere of the <i>Special School of Medicine</i> of Paris;
there are two others, one at Montpellier, and one at Strasburg. At Alfort, near
Paris, is established, on a grand scale, a</p>
<p class="center">VETERINARY SCHOOL. </p>
<p>It would lead me too far to particularize every department of this extensive
establishment; but one of these is too useful to be passed over in silence.
Here are spacious hospitals where animals are classed, not only according to
their species, but also according to the species of disorder by which they are
affected. Every person may bring hither sick animals, on paying for their food
and medicaments only, the operations and dressings being performed and applied
<i>gratis</i>.</p>
<p>There are also Veterinary Schools at Lyons, Turin, and Rodez.</p>
<p>In addition to all these schools are to be established, in different parts
of the Republic, the following new <i>Special Schools</i>.</p>
<p>Ten of Jurisprudence.<br />
Three of Medicine.<br />
Four of Natural History, Physics, and Chymistry.<br />
One of Transcendent Mathematics.<br />
Two of Technology.<br />
One of Public Economy, enlightened by Geography and History.<br />
One of the Arts dependent on design, and, lastly,<br />
A new Military School.</p>
<p>From the foregoing enumeration, it is evident that the government can never
be at a loss for persons duly qualified to perform the duties of every branch
of the Public Service. True it is that the nation is at a considerable expense
in giving to them the instruction which fits them for the employment; but, in
return, what advantages does not the nation derive from the exertion of their
talent?</p>

<h2><a name="let62">LETTER LXII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 5, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>In one of your recent letters, you interrogated me respecting the changes
which the revolution had produced in the ceremonies immediately connected with
the increase and decrease of population. While the subject is fresh in my mind,
I shall present the contrast which I have observed, in the years 1789-90 and
1801-2, in the ceremony of</p>
<p class="center">FUNERALS.</p>
<p>Under the old <i>régime</i>, there was no medium in them; they were either
very indecorous or very expensive. I have been positively assured that eighteen
francs were paid for what was called a parish-funeral, and not unfrequently a
quarrel arose between the agent of the rector and the relations of the
deceased. However, as it was necessary to bury every one, the <i>Commissaire de
police</i> declared the fact, if the relations were unable to pay. Those for
whom eighteen francs were paid, had a coffin in which they were buried; the
others were laid in a common coffin or shell, from which they were taken to be
put into the ground. In a parish-funeral, whether paid or not, several dead
bodies were assembled, that is, they were carried one after the other, but at
the same time to the same ground. They were conducted by a single priest,
reciting by the way the accustomed prayers.</p>
<p>Other funerals were varied without end, according to the fortune or pleasure
of the relations. For persons of the richest class, a flaming chapel was
constructed at the entrance of the house. This chapel was hung with black
cloth, and in it was placed the corpse, surrounded by lighted torches. The
apartments were also hung with black for the reception of the persons who were
to attend the funeral procession. The priests came to conduct the corpse from
the house of the deceased. They were more or less numerous, had or had not wax
tapers, according to the will of those who defrayed the expenses. If the
presentation of the corpse at the parish-church took place in the morning, a
mass was sung; if in the evening, obsequies only were chaunted, and the former
service was deferred till the next morning. The relations and friends, in
mourning, followed the corpse. These persons walked in the procession,
according to their degree of relationship to the deceased, and besides their
complete mourning-suit, wore a black cloak, more or less long, according to the
quality of the persons (or the price paid for it), and a flapped hat, from
which was suspended a very long crape band. Their hair, unpowdered, fell loose
on their back. In lieu of a cloak, lawyers, whether presidents, counsellors,
attornies, or tipstaffs, wore their black gown. On the cuff of their coat, men
wore weepers, consisting of a band of cambric. Every one wore black gloves, and
likewise a long pendent white cravat. People of the highest rank wore <i>cottés
crépés</i>, that is, a sort of crape petticoat, which fell from the waist to
the feet. This was meant to represent the ancient coat of arms.</p>
<p>Servants in mourning, or pages for princes, supported the train of the cloak
or gown of persons above the common rank. Other servants, also in mourning,
surrounded the relations and friends of the deceased, holding torches with his
armorial bearings, if he was a <i>noble</i>. Persons extremely rich or very
elevated in rank, hired a certain number of poor (from fifty to three hundred),
over whom were thrown several ells of coarse iron gray cloth, to which no
particular form was given. They walked before the corpse, holding large lighted
torches. The procession was closed by the carriages of persons belonging to it;
and their owners did not get into them till their return from the funeral.
Sometimes on coming out of the parish-church, where the presentation of the
corpse was indispensable, the rector performing the office of magistrate in
regard to the delivery of the certificate of presentation, the corpse was
carried into a particular church to be buried. This was become uncommon before
the revolution, as to do this it was necessary to possess a vault, or pay
extremely dear, it being prohibited by law, except in such cases, to bury the
dead in churches.</p>
<p>When the deceased belonged to a society or corporation, they sent a
deputation to attend him to the grave, or followed in a body, if he was their
chief. At the funeral of a prince of the blood, all his household, civil and
military, marched in the procession. The <i>corbillard</i>, or sort of hearse,
in which his highness was carried to <i>St. Denis</i>, was almost as large as
the moveable theatre which Mr. Flockton transports from fair to fair in
England. Calculated in appearance for carrying the body of a giant, it was
decorated with escutcheons, and drawn by eight horses, also caparisoned to
correspond with the hearse. These, however, were but the trappings of woe.</p>
<p>While this funereal car moved slowly forward amidst a concourse of mourners,
its three-fold hangings concealed from the eye of the observer the journeymen
coach and harness makers, drinking, and playing at dice on the lid of his
highness's coffin, by way of dispelling the <i>ennui</i> of the journey. These
careless fellows were placed there to be at hand to repair any accident that
might happen on the road; so, while, on the outside of the hearse, all wore the
appearance of sadness; within, all was mirth; no bad image of the reverse of
grandeur and the emptiness of human ostentation.</p>
<p>Such were the ceremonies observed in funerals before the revolution. Passing
over the interval, from its commencement in 1789 to the end of the year 1801, I
shall describe those practised at the present day. It now depends on the
relations to have the corpse presented at the parish-church; but there are many
persons who dispense with this ceremony. The priests receive the corpse at the
door of the church. It is carried thither in a <i>corbillard</i>. Each
municipality has its own, and there are twelve municipalities in Paris. Some of
them have adopted the Egyptian style; some, the Greek; and others, the Roman,
for the fashion of their <i>corbillard</i>, according to the taste of the
municipality who ordered its construction. It is drawn by two horses abreast,
caparisoned somewhat like those of our hearses. The coachman and the four
bearers are clothed in iron gray or black. An officer of the police, also
clothed in black, and holding a cane with an ivory head, walks before the
<i>corbillard</i> or hearse. Each corpse has its particular coffin furnished by
the municipality. Arrangements have been so made that the rich are made to pay
for the poor. The coffin is covered with a black cloth, without a cross, for
fear of scaring philosophers and protestants. The relations follow on foot, or
in carriages, even in town. Few of them are in mourning, and still fewer wear a
cloak.</p>
<p>At the <i>Sainte Chapelle</i>, near the <i>Palais de Justice</i>, is a
private establishment where, mourning is let out for hire. Here are to be had
<i>corbillards</i> on a more elegant plan. These are carriages hung on springs,
and bearing much resemblance to our most fashionable sociables with a standing
awning; so much so, that the first of them I saw I mistook for a
<i>mourning</i> sociable. Some are ornamented with black feathers. Caparisons,
hangings, every thing is in black, as well as the coachman. This speculator
also lets out mourning coaches, black without and within, like those in use in
London. At a few funerals, these are hired for the mourners, and at a recent
one, fifteen of these carriages were counted in the procession. However, this
luxury of burials is not entirely come again into fashion. In the inside of the
church, every thing passes as formerly.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed from the <i>grave</i> to the <i>gay</i>, and conclude
this letter with a concise observation on</p>
<p class="center">MARRIAGES.</p>
<p>The <i>civil</i> act of marriage is entered into at the office of the
municipality. But this civil act must not be coufounded with the contract,
drawn up by the notary, and containing the stipulations, clauses, and
conditions. The former signifies merely that such a man and such a woman take
each other for man and wife. There are few, if any, persons married, who, from
the municipality, do not repair to the parish-church, or go thither the next
morning; the civil act being considered by individuals only as the ceremony of
the betrothing, and till the priest has given the nuptial benediction, the
relations take care that the intended bride and bridegroom shall have no
opportunity of anticipating the duties of marriage.</p>
<p>Political opinions, therefore, prevent but few persons from going to church.
Mass is said in a low voice, during which the priest, or the rector, receives
the promise of the wedded pair. With little exception, the ceremony is the same
for all. Those who pay well are married at the high altar; the rector addresses
to them a speech in which he exhorts them to live happily together; the beadles
perform their duty; and the organist strikes up a voluntary.</p>
<p>In regard to marriages, the present and former times presenting no other
contrast, I have nothing more to add on the subject.</p>
<h2><a name="let63">LETTER LXIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 6, 1803.</i></p>
<p>The mode of life of the persons with whom I chiefly associate here,
precludes me from reading as much as I could wish, either for instruction or
amusement. This, you will say, I ought not to regret; for a traveller visits
foreign countries to study mankind, not books. Unquestionably, the men who,
like splendid folios in a library, make at present the most conspicuous figure
in this metropolis, are worth studying; and, could we lay them open to our
inspection, as we do books of a common description, it would be extremely
entertaining to turn them over every morning, till we had them, in a manner, by
heart. But I rather apprehend that they partake, more or less, of the qualities
of a book just come out of the hands of the binder, which it is difficult to
open. Let us therefore content ourselves with viewing them as we would volumes
of a superbly-bound edition, not to be examined by the general observer, and
direct our eyes to such objects as are fully exposed to investigation.</p>
<p>In Paris, there are several public libraries, the greater part of them open
every day; but that which eclipses all the others, is the</p>
<p class="center">BIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE.</p>
<p>Charles V, justly surnamed the <i>Wise</i>, from the encouragement he gave
to learning, may be considered as the first founder of this library. According
to the President Henault, that king had collected nine hundred volumes; whereas
king John, his father, possessed not twenty. This collection was placed in a
tower of the <i>Louvre</i>, called <i>La Tour de la Librairie</i>, which was
lighted up every night, in order that the learned might pursue their studies
there at all hours.</p>
<p>After the death of Charles VI, in 1423, the inventory amounted to no more
than one hundred and twenty volumes, though several works had been added,
because on the other hand, a great number had been lost.</p>
<p>When Paris fell into the power of the English, in 1429, the Duke of Bedford,
then regent of France, purchased these books, for which he paid 1200 livres,
and the library was entirely dispersed. Charles VII, being continually engaged
in war, could not concern himself in its re-estahlishment. Lewis XI collected
the remains scattered in different royal residences, and availed himself of the
resources afforded by the invention of printing, which was discovered at
Strasburg or Mentz in 1440.</p>
<p>Printers, however, were not established in Paris till 1470, and in that same
year, they dedicated to Lewis XI one of the first books which they printed.
Books were, at this time, very scarce and dear, and continued so for several
years, both before and after the discovery of that invention. Twenty thousand
persons then subsisted in France by the sale of the books which they
transcribed. This was the reason why printing was not at first more
encouraged.</p>
<p>Charles VIII added to this literary establishment such works as he was able
to obtain in his conquest of Naples. Lewis XII increased it by the library of
Potrarch. Francis I enriched it with Greek manuscripts; but what most
contributed to augment the collection was the ordinance of Henry II, issued in
1556, which enjoined booksellers to furnish the royal libraries with a copy on
vellum of all the works printed by privilege; and, under the subsequent reigns,
it gradually acquired that richness and abundance which, before the revolution,
had caused it to be considered as one of the first libraries in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1789, the <i>Bibliothèque du Roi</i>, as it was till then called, was
reckoned to contain one hundred and eighty thousand printed volumes, eighty
thousand manuscripts, a prodigious numbcr of medals, antiques, and engraved
stones, six thousand port-folios of prints, and two thousand engraved plates.
But, under its present denomination of <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, it has
been considerably augmented. Agreeably to your desire, I shall point out
whatever is most remarkable in these augmentations.</p>
<p>The buildings, which, since the year 1721, contain this vast collection,
formally made part of the <i>Hôtel Mazarin</i>. The entrance is by the <i>Rue
de la Loi</i>. It is at present divided into four departments, and is managed
by a conservatory, composed of eight members, namely:</p>
<ol class="digital">
<li>Two conservators for the printed books, M. M. CAPPERONNIER and
VAN-PRAET.</li>
<li>Three for the manuscripts, M. M. LANGLÈS, LAPORTE DUTHEIL, and DACIER.</li>
<li>Two for the antiques, medals, and engraved stones, M. M. MILLIN and
GOSSELIN.</li>
<li>One for the prints and engraved plates, M. JOLY.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first department, containing the printed books, occupies, on the first
floor of the three sides of the court, an extent of about nine hundred feet by
twenty-four in breadth. The rooms, which receive light on one side only, are
equal in height. In the second room to the right is the <i>Parnasse
Français</i>, a little mountain, in bronze, covered with figures a foot high,
and with medals, representing French poets. Lewis XIV here occupies a
distinguished place under the figure of Apollo. It was a present made by TITON
DU TILLET.</p>
<p>In another of these rooms, built on purpose, are a pair of globes of an
extraordinary size, constructed, in 1683, by Father CORONELLI, a Jesuit, for
Cardinal D'ESTRÉES, who presented them to Lewis XIV. The feet of these globes
rest in a lower apartment; while their hemispheres project by two apertures
made in the floor of fhe first story, and are thus placed within reach of the
observer. Their diameter is eleven feet, eleven inches. The celebrated
BUTTERFIELD made for them two brass circles, (the one for the meridian, the
other for the horizon), each eighteen feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Since the year 1789, the department of printed books has received an
augmentation of one hundred and forty thousand volumes, either arising from
private acquisitions, or collected in France, Italy, Holland, Germany, or
Belgium. Among these is a valuable series of works, some more scarce than
others, executed in the XVth century, which has rendered this department one of
the most complete in Europe. I shall abstain from entering into a detail of the
articles assembled in it, several of which deserve particular notice. A great
many ancient specimens of the typographical art are on vellum, and give to this
collection a value which it would be no easy matter to appreciate. All the
classes of it present a great number, the enumeration of which would far exceed
my limits.</p>
<p>The department of manuscripts, which is placed in a gallery one hundred and
forty feet in length, by twenty-two in breadth, has been increased in
proportion to that of the printed books. The library of Versailles, that of
several emigrants, the chapters of various cathedrals, the Sorbonne, the
<i>Collège de Navarre</i> in Paris, and the different suppressed religious
corporations, have enriched it with upwards of twenty thousand volumes; eight
thousand of these belonged to the library of <i>St. Germain-des-Prês</i>, which
was burnt in 1793-4, and was immensely rich in manuscripts and old printed
hooks.</p>
<p>About fifteen hundred volumes have been taken from Italy, Holland, and
Germany. Among those arrived from Italy, we must distinguish the original
manuscript of RUFFIN, a priest of Aquilea, who lived in the IVth century,
containing, on papyrus or Egyptian paper, the Latin tranlation of the Jewish
antiquities of FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS; the grammar of PROBUS or PALÆMON, a manuscript
of the Vth century, on vellum, in uncial characters; a very beautiful volume in
Syriac, containing the Four Evangelists, a manuscript on vellum of the VIth
century; the two celebrated manuscripts of Virgil of the VIIth century, the one
from the Vatican, the other from Florence, both on vellum. A roll, in good
preservation, composed of several skins, sewed together, containing the
Pentateuch in Hebrew, a manuscript of the IXth century. A Terence, with figures
of the time and a representation of the masks introduced on the stage by the
ancients, together with the various poetical works of PRUDENTIUS; manuscripts
on vellum of the IXth century. The Terence is that of the Vatican, in praise of
which Madame DACIER speaks in her translation.</p>
<p>The manuscripts of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, which had so long
constituted the ornament of the library of Brussels, now increase the fame of
those which the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i> already possessed of this
description. Their number is about five hundred volumes; the greater part of
them are remarkable for the beauty and richness of the miniatures by which they
are embellished, and one scarcely inferior in magnificence to the primer of
Anne de Bretagne, wife of Lewis XII, to that of Cardinal Richelieu, to the
primer and battles of Lewis XIV, and to a heap of other manuscripts which
rendered this <i>ci-devant Bibliothèque du Roi</i> so celebrated in foreign
countries.</p>
<p>Five large apartments on the second floor are occupied by titles and
genealogies, which are still preserved here, in about five thousand portfolios
or boxes, for the purpose of verifying the claims to property, and assisting
the historian in his researches.</p>
<p>The department of medals, antiques and engraved stones has, since 1789, also
experienced an abundant augmentation. The medals are in a cabinet at the end of
the Library; the antiques are in another, above it, on the second floor.</p>
<p>In 1790, the engraved stones which had been previously locked up in the
drawers of the council-chamber at Versailles, were conveyed hither, to the
number of eight hundred. It would be too tedious to dwell on the beauty, merit,
and scarceness of these stones, as well as on their finished workmanship and
degree of antiquity. Among them, the beautiful ring, called the <i>seal of
Michael Angelo</i>, claims admiration.</p>
<p>In 1791, some antiquities which constituted part of the treasure of <i>St.
Denis</i>, were brought hither from that abbey. Among these valuable articles,
we must particularly distinguish the chalice of the Abbot SUGER; a vase of
sardonyx, with two handles formed of raised snakes, on which are represented,
with admirable art, ceremonies relating to the worship of Bacchus; a large gold
cup, ornamented with enamel of various colours; a very large urn of porphyry,
which formerly served as a sepulchral monument; several baptismal fonts; the
arm-chair of King Dagobert, a piece of very extraordinary workmanship for the
time in which it was executed. Among the valuable articles removed hither from
<i>La Sainte Chapelle</i> in Paris, in the same year, are to be particularly
remarked a sardonyx, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and commonly
called <i>l'agathe de la Sainte Chapelle</i>. This stone is the largest and
rarest known of that species. It was brought to France in the year 1383 by king
Charles V.</p>
<p>At the end of 1792 the cabinet of medals of <i>St. Geneviève</i>, forming in
the whole seventeen thousand articles, and its fine collection of antique
monuments, increased the new riches accumulated in the <i>Bibliothèque
Nationale</i>. In 1794, a beautiful series of antiquities, consisting of a
great number of imperial medals, of nations, cities, and kings, of all sizes,
in gold, silver, and bronze, together with little painted figures, busts,
instruments of sacrifices, &amp;c. arrived here from Holland.</p>
<p>In 1796, the department of medals was also enriched by several articles from
the <i>Garde-Meuble</i> or Jewel-Office. Among them were some suits of armour
belonging to several of the kings of France, particularly that of Francis I,
that of Henry IV, and that of Lewis XIV. These were accompanied by a quantity
of arms, helmets, shields, breast-plates, and weapons used in the ancient
tournaments, as well as quivers, bows, arrows, swords, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1798 and in 1799, several valuable articles
arrived here from Italy, among which are two crowns of gold, enriched with
precious stones, worn by the ancient kings of Lombardy, at the time of their
coronation; the engraved stones and medals of the Pope's cabinet; a head of
Jupiter Ægiochus, on a ground of sardonyx, a master-piece of art, which is
above all eulogium; the celebrated Isiac table, in copper incrustated with
silver, a valuable table of Egyptian mythology, which is presumed to have been
executed, either at Alexandria or at Rome, in the first or second century of
the christian era; some oriental weapons; a <i>fetfa</i> or diploma of the
Grand Signior contained in a silk purse, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The department of prints and engraved plates, formed of the celebrated
cabinets of MAHOLLES, BERINGHEN, GAIGNIÈRES, UXELLES, BEGON, GAYLUS, FONTETTE,
MARIETTE, &amp;c. contained, before the revolution the most ample, rich, and
valuable collection in Europe. It is placed in the <i>entresol</i>, and is
divided into twelve classes.</p>
<p>The first class comprehends sculptors, architectural engineers, and
engravers, from the origin of the French nation to the present day, arranged in
schools.</p>
<p>The second, prints, emblems, and devices of piety.</p>
<p>The third, every thing relative to fables and Greek and Roman
antiquities.</p>
<p>The fourth, medals, coins, and heraldry.</p>
<p>The fifth, public festivals, cavalcades, and tournaments.</p>
<p>The sixth, arts and mathematics.</p>
<p>The seventh, prints relating to novels and books of entertainment.</p>
<p>The eighth, natural history in all its branches.</p>
<p>The ninth, geography.</p>
<p>The tenth, plans and elevations of ancient and modern buildings.</p>
<p>The eleventh, portraits of all professions, to the number of upwards of
fifty thousand.</p>
<p>The twelfth, a collection of the fashions and dresses of almost every
country in the world.</p>
<p>Since 1789, the augmentations made to it are considerable. Among these must
be distinguished four hundred and thirty-five volumes brought from the library
of Versailles, and fifty-two others, infinitely valuable, respecting China,
found at the residence of M. BERTIN, Minister, about eight thousand prints
brought from Holland, the greater part of them, very fine impressions; and
about twelve thousand collected by different emigrants, almost all modern,
indeed, but one half of which are select, and remarkable for their fine
preservation.</p>
<p>Among five hundred volumes, obtained from the suppressed religious
corporations, are to be remarked one hundred and nine port-folios from the
abbey of <i>St. Victor</i>, in Paris, containing a beautiful series of
mythological, historical, and typographical subjects. This forms a valuable
addition to the collection of the same kind of which the department of prints
was already in possession.</p>
<p>In one hundred and forty-four volumes brought from Cologne, there are
several scarce and singular engravings.</p>
<p>As for sixty articles sent from Italy, they are, with the exception of the
<i>Museum Pio-Clementinum</i>, in such a state of degradation that they are
scarcely fit for any thing but to mark the place which each composition has to
occupy.</p>
<p>Since 1789, the department of prints has made several acquisitions deserving
of notice, such as the works of LEBAS, MARCENAY, and RODE, all extremely
difficult to find complete, and three hundred and seventeen plates sent from
Germany by FHAUENHOTZ; most of them executed by foreign engravers, and some are
very capital.</p>
<p>A few well-known distinguished artists and amateurs, among whom I must not
omit to name DENON, ST. AUBIN, and LAMOTTE, a merchant at Havre, have
generously enriched the department of prints with a great number of very
valuable ones.</p>
<p>The library is open every day, Sundays, and days of national fêtes excepted,
from ten o'clock till two, to persons who wish to read, study, or take notes;
and for whom every accommodation is provided; but to such as are attracted by
curiosity alone, on the Wednesdays and Fridays of each week, at the same hours.
On those days, you may perambulate in the different rooms of this magnificent
establishment; on the other days, walking is here prohibited, in order that
students may not be interrupted. However, JOHN BULL seems to pay little regard
to this prohibition. <a name="let63fr1"></a>Englishmen are frequently seen
stalking about the rooms at the forbidden time, as if they meant to shew that
they disdained the rules of propriety and
decorum.[<a href="#let63f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>Under the government which succeeded the monarchy, was established, within
the precincts of the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, a</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL FOR ORIENTAL LIVING LANGUAGES.</p>
<p>The design of this school, <i>which is of acknowledged utility in politics
and commerce</i>, is to qualify persons to supply the place of the French
droguemans in the East, who, at the beginning of the troubles which distracted
France, abandoned the interests of their country, and deserted their
stations.</p>
<p>LANGLÈS, president of this school, here teaches the Persian and Malay
languages.</p>
<p>SILVESTRE DE SACY, literal and vulgar Arabic.</p>
<p>JAUBERT, Turkish and the Tartarian of the Crimea.</p>
<p>DANSE DE VILLOISON, modern Greek.</p>
<p>In general, very few pupils are instructed here, and the greater part of
those who begin the courses of lectures, do not follow them three months. This
fact I gathered from the professors themselves. When FRANÇOIS DE NEUFCHÂTEAU
was Minister, he had attached to this school an Armenian, named CIREIED, who
gave lessons in his native language, which are now discontinued.</p>
<p>A course of archæology is also delivered here by the learned MILLIN. The
object of this course is to explain antique monuments, and compare them with
passages of the classics. The professor indicates respecting each monument the
opinions of the different learned men who have spoken of it: he also discusses
those opinions, and endeavours to establish that which deserves to be adopted.
Every year he treats on different subjects. The courses which he has already
delivered, related to the study of medals, and that of engraved stones; the
explanation of the ancient monuments still existing in Spain, France, and
England; the history of ancient and modern Egypt; sacred and heroic mythology,
under which head he introduced an explanation of almost every monument of
literature and art deserving to be known.</p>

<h2><a name="let64">LETTER LXIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 8, 1803.</i></p>
<p>Having complied with your desire in regard to the <i>Bibliothèque
Nationale</i>, I shall confine myself to a hasty sketch of the other principal
public libraries, beginning with the</p>
<p class="center">BIBLIOTHÈQUE MAZARINE.</p>
<p>By his will, dated the 6th of March 1662, Cardinal MAZARIN bequeathed this
library for the convenience of the literati. It was formed by GABRIEL NAUDÉ of
every thing that could be found most rare and curious, as well in France as in
foreign countries. It occupies one of the pavilions and other apartments of the
<i>ci-devant Collège Mazarin ou des Quatre Nations</i>, at present called
<i>Palais des Beaux Arts</i>.</p>
<p>No valuable additions have been made to this library since the revolution;
but it is kept in excellent order. The Conservators, LE BLOND, COQUILLE, and
PALISSOT, whose complaisance is never tired, are well known in the Republic of
Letters. It is open to the public every day, from ten o'clock to two, Sundays,
Thursdays, and the days of national fêtes excepted.</p>
<p class="center">BIBLIOTHÈQUE DU PANTHÉON.</p>
<p>Next to the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, this library is said to contain
the most printed books and manuscripts, which are valuable on account of their
antiquity, scarceness, and preservation. It formerly bore the title of
<i>Bibliothèque de St. Geneviève</i>, and belonged to the Canons of that order,
who had enriched it in a particular manner. The acquisitions it has made since
the revolution are not sufficiently important to deserve to be mentioned. With
the exception of the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, not one of the public
libraries in Paris has enjoyed the advantage of making improvements and
additions. The library of the <i>Pantheon</i> is open to the public on the same
days as the <i>Bibliothèque Mazarine</i>.</p>
<p>The present Conservators are DAUNOU, VENTENAT, and VIALLON. The first two
are members of the National Institute.</p>
<p class="center">BIBLIOTHÈQUE DE L'ARSENAL.</p>
<p>This library, one of the richest in Paris, formerly belonged to the Count
d'Artois. It is destined for the <i>Conservative Senate</i>, in whose palace a
place is preparing for its reception. However, it is thought that this removal
cannot take place in less than a year and a half or two years. It has acquired
little since the revolution, and is frequented less than the other libraries,
because it is rather remote from the fashionable quarters of the town. There
are few inquisitive persons in the vicinity of the Arsenal; and indeed, this
library is open only on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays of every week from
ten o'clock till two. AMEILHON, of the Institute, is Administrator; and
SAUGRAIN, Conservator.</p>
<p>Before I quit this library, you will, doubtless expect me to say something
of the place from which it derives its appellation; namely,</p>
<p class="center">THE ARSENAL.</p>
<p>It is a pile of building, forming several courts between the <i>Quai des
Célestins</i> and the <i>Place de la Liberté</i>, formerly the <i>Place de la
Bastille</i>. Charles V had here erected some storehouses for artillery, which
were lent very unwillingly by the Provost of Paris to Francis I, who wanted
them for the purpose of casting cannon. As was foreseen, the king kept
possession of them, and converted them into a royal residence. On the 28th of
January 1562, lightning fell on one of the towers, then used as a magazine, and
set fire to fifteen or twenty thousand barrels of powder. Several lives were
lost, and another effect of this explosion was that it killed all the fishes in
the river. Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV rebuilt the Arsenal, and
augmented it considerably. Before the revolution, the founderies served for
casting bronze figures for the embellishment of the royal gardens. The Arsenal
then contained only a few rusty muskets and some mortars unfit for service,
notwithstanding the energetic inscription which decorated the gate on the
<i>Quai des Célestins</i>:</p>
<p class="bq">"Ætnæ hæc Henrico Vulcania tela ministrat,<br />
Tela gigantæos debellatura furores."</p>
<p>NICOLAS BOURBON was the author of these harmonious lines, which so much
excited the jealousy of the famous poet, SANTEUIL, that he exclaimed in his
enthusiasm, "I would have wished to have made them, and been hanged."</p>
<p>During the course of the revolution, the buildings of the Arsenal have been
appropriated to various purposes: at present even they seem to have no fixed
destination. Here is a garden, advantageously situated, which affords to the
inhabitants of this quarter an agreeable promenade.</p>
<p>The before-mentioned libraries are the most considerable in Paris; but the
<i>National Institute</i>, the <i>Conservative Senate</i>, the <i>Legislative
Body</i>, and the <i>Tribunate</i>, have each their respective library, as well
as the <i>Polytechnic School</i>, the <i>Council of the School of Mines</i>,
the <i>Tribunal of Cassation</i>, the <i>Conservatory of Music</i>, the
<i>Museum of Natural History</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Independently of these libraries, here are also three literary <i>dépôts</i>
or repositories, which were destined to supply the public libraries already
formed or to be formed, particularly those appropriated to public instruction.
When the Constituent Assembly decreed the possessions of the clergy to be
national property, the <i>Committee of Alienation</i> fixed on the monasteries
of the <i>Capucins</i>, <i>Grands Jésuites</i>, and <i>Cordeliers</i>, in
Paris, as <i>dépôts</i>, for the books and manuscripts, which they were
desirous to save from revolutionary destruction.</p>
<h2><a name="let65">LETTER LXV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 9, 1802.</i></p>
<p><i>Vive la danse!</i> <i>Vive la danse!</i> seems now to prevail here
universally over <i>"Vive l'amour!</i> <i>Vive la bagatelle!</i>" which was the
rage in the time of LA FLEUR. I have already informed you that, in moments the
most eventful, the inhabitants of this capital spent the greater part of their
time in</p>
<p class="center">DANCING.</p>
<p>However extraordinary the fact may appear, it is no less true. When the
Prussians were at Châlons, the Austrians at Valenciennes, and Robespierre in
the Convention, they danced. When the young conscripts were in momentary
expectation of quitting their parents, their friends, and their mistresses to
join the armies, they danced. Can we then wonder that, at the present hour,
when the din of arms is no longer heard, and the toils of war are on the point
of being succeeded by the mercantile speculations of peace, dancing should
still be the favourite pursuit of the Parisians?</p>
<p>This is so much the case, that the walls of the metropolis are constantly
covered by advertisements in various colours, blue, red, green, and yellow,
announcing balls of different descriptions. The silence of streets the least
frequented is interrupted by the shrill scraping of the itinerant fiddler;
while by-corners, which might vie with Erebus itself in darkness, are lighted
by transparencies, exhibiting, in large characters, the words "<i>Bal de
Société</i>."&mdash;"Happy people!" says Sterne, "who can lay down all your
cares together, and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance,
which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth!"</p>
<p>In summer, people dance here in rural gardens, or delightful bowers, or
under marquees, or in temporary buildings, representing picturesque cottages,
constructed within the limits of the capital: these establishments, which are
rather of recent date, are open only in that gay season.</p>
<p>In winter, the upper classes assemble in magnificent apartments, where
subscription-balls are given; and taste and luxury conspire to produce elegant
entertainments.</p>
<p>However, it is not to the upper circles alone that this amusement is
confined; it is here pursued, and with truer ardour too, by citizens of every
class and description. An Englishman might probably be at a loss to conceive
this truth; I shall therefore enumerate the different gradations of the scale
from the report of an impartial eye-witness, partly corroborated by my own
observation.</p>
<p>Tradesmen dance with their neighbours, at the residence of those who have
the best apartments: and the expense of catgut, rosin, &amp;c. is paid by the
profits of the card-table.</p>
<p>Young clerks in office and others, go to public balls, where the
<i>cavalier</i> pays thirty <i>sous</i> for admission; thither they escort
milliners and mantua-makers of the elegant class, and, in general, the
first-rate order of those engaging belles, known here by the generic name of
<i>grisettes</i>.</p>
<p>Jewellers' apprentices, ladies' hair-dressers, journeymen tailors and
upholsterers dance, at twenty <i>sous</i> a head, with sempstresses and ladies'
maids.</p>
<p>Journeymen shoemakers, cabinet-makers, and workmen of other trades, not very
laborious, assemble in <i>guingettes</i>, where they dance French
country-dances at three <i>sous</i> a ticket, with <i>grisettes</i> of an
inferior order.</p>
<p>Locksmiths, carpenters, and joiners dance at two <i>sous</i> a ticket, with
women who constantly frequent the <i>guinguettes</i>, a species of
dancing-girls, whom the tavern-keepers hire for the day, as they do the
fiddlers.</p>
<p>Water-carriers, porters, and, in general, the Swiss and Auvergnats have
their private balls, where they execute the dances peculiar to their country,
with fruit-girls, stocking-menders, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The porters of the corn-market form assemblies in their own neighbourhood;
but the youngest only go thither, with a few <i>bons vivans</i>, whose
profession it would be no easy matter to determine. Bucksome damsels, proof
against every thing, keep them in countenance, either in drinking brandy or in
fighting, and not unfrequently at the same <i>bal de société</i>, all this goes
on at the same time, and, as it were, in unison.</p>
<p>Those among the porters of the corn-market and charcoal carriers, who have a
little <i>manners</i>, assemble on holidays, in public-houses of a more decent
description, with good, plain-spoken market-women, and nosegay-girls. They
drink unmixed liquor, and the conversation is somewhat more than <i>free</i>;
but, in public, they get tipsy, and nothing farther!</p>
<p>Masons, paviours in wooden shoes, tipped with iron, and other hard-working
men, in short, repair to <i>guingettes</i>, and make the very earth tremble
with their heavy, but picturesque capers, forming groups worthy of the pencil
of Teniers.</p>
<p>Lastly, one more link completes the chain of this nomenclature of caperers.
Beggars, sturdy, or decrepit, dance, as well as their credulous betters: they
not only dance, but drink to excess; and their orgies are more noisy, more
prolonged, and even more expensive. The mendicant, who was apparently lame in
the day, at night lays aside his crutch, and resumes his natural activity; the
idle vagabond, who concealed one arm, now produces both; while the wretch whose
wound excited both horror and pity, covers for a tune the large blister by
which he makes a very comfortable living.</p>
<h2><a name="let66">LETTER LXVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 11, 1802.</i></p>
<p>In order to confer handsome pensions on the men of science who had benefited
mankind by their labours, and who, under the old <i>régime</i>, were poorly
rewarded, in 1795, LAKANAL solicited and obtained the establishment of the</p>
<p class="center">BUREAU DES LONGITUDES.</p>
<p><a name="let66fr1"></a>As members of this Board of Longitude, the first
institution of the kind in France, LAGRANGE, LAPLACE, LALANDE,
CASSINI,[<a href="#let66f1">1</a>] MÉCHAIN, BORDA,[<a href="#let66f1">1</a>]
BOUGAINVILLE, FLEURIEU, MESSIER, BUACHE, and CARROCHÉ, the optician, had each
8,000 francs (<i>circa</i> £. 330 sterling) a year, and the assistant
astronomers, 4,000. Indeed, the professors of that science were in want of
pecuniary assistance for the purpose of forming pupils.</p>
<p>The <i>Bureau des Longitudes</i> is on a more extensive scale, and possesses
greater authority than the Board of Longitude in England. It is charged with
the administration of all the Observatories belonging to the Republic, as well
as with the correspondence with the astronomers of foreign countries. The
government refers to it the examination of memoirs relative to navigation. Such
of its members as more specially cultivate practical astronomy in the National
Observatories of the capital, are charged to make all Observations which may
contribute to the progress of that science, and procure new means for
rectifying the tables of the Sun, as well as those which make known the
position of the stars, and particularly the tables of the Moon, the improvement
of which so essentially concerns the safety of navigation.</p>
<p>The great importance of the last-mentioned tables induced this Board, about
three years ago, to propose a premium of 6,000 francs (<i>circa</i> £. 250
sterling) for tables of the Moon. LALANDE recommended to BONAPARTE to double
it. <a name="let66fr2"></a>The First Consul took his advice: and the French now
have tables that greatly surpass those which are used in
England.[<a href="#let66f2">2</a>] A copy of these have, I understand, been
sent to Mr. MASKELYNE, our Astronomer-Royal at Greenwich.</p>
<p>The Board of Longitude of France, like that of England, calculates for every
year Tables or <i>Ephemerides</i>, known in Europe under the title of
<i>Connaissance des Tems</i>. The French having at length procured able
calculators, are now able to dispense with the English <i>Ephemeris</i>. Their
observations follow each other in such a manner as to render it unnecessary for
them to recur to those of Greenwich, of which they have hitherto made continual
use. Since the year 1795, the <i>Connaissance des Tems</i> has been compiled by
JÉROME LALANDE. At the end of the tables and their explanation, it contains a
collection of observations, memoirs, and important calculations. The French
astronomers are not a little surprised that we publish no similar work in
London; while Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Gotha, and Milan set us the example. It is
in the last volumes of the <i>Connaissance des Tems</i> that JÉROME LALANDE
gives the history of astronomy, where you will find every thing that has been
done in this science.</p>
<p>The <i>Bureau des Longitudes</i> also publishes for every year, in advance,
the <i>Annuaire de la République</i>, which serves as a rule for all the
almanacks compiled in France. The meetings of the Board are held at the</p>
<p class="center">NATIONAL OBSERVATORY.</p>
<p>This edifice, which is situated at the farther end of the <i>Faubourg St.
Jacques</i>, was constructed  in 1664, by order of COLBERT, and under the
direction of PERRAULT, the medical architect, who planned the celebrated façade
of the <i>Louvre</i>.</p>
<p>The form of the building is rectangular. Neither wood nor iron have been
employed in its construction. It is arched throughout, and its four sides stand
exactly in the direction of the four cardinal points of the horizon. Although
its elevation is eighty-five feet, it comprises but two stories, terminated by
a flat roof, whence you command a fine view of Paris. You ascend thither by a
winding staircase which has a hollow newel. This staircase, consisting of three
hundred and sixty steps, extends downward to a similar depth of eighty-five
feet, and forms a sort of well, at the bottom of which you can perceive the
light. From this well have been observed the different degrees of acceleration
in the descent of bodies.</p>
<p>The subterraneous vaults have served for meteorological experiments. In one
of them water is seen to petrify on filtering through the rock above. They lead
to near fifty streets or passages, formed by quarries excavated in procuring
the stones with which great part of the city of Paris is constructed.</p>
<p>Previously to the year 1777, churches, palaces, whole streets of houses, and
the public highway of several quarters of Paris and its environs, were on the
point of being swallowed up in gulfs no less vast in depth than in extent.
Since then, considerable works have been undertaken to consolidate these
subterraneous caverns, and fill up the void, equally dangerous, occasioned by
the working of the plaster-quarries.</p>
<p>An accident of a very alarming nature, which happened in the <i>Rue
d'Enfer</i> in the year 1774; and another, at Montmenil, in 1778, shewed the
necessity of expediting these operations, which were followed up with great
activity from 1777 to 1789, when their progress was relaxed from the
circumstances of the times. These quarries are far more extensive than is
commonly imagined. In the department of the Seine alone, they extend under all
the south part of Paris, and the roads, plains, and <i>communes</i>, to the
distance of several leagues round the circumference of this city. Their roof,
with the edifices standing on the soil that covers it, is either supported by
walls recently built under the foundation of those edifices, or by pillars
constructed at different periods in several places. The government is at the
expense of providing for the safety of the streets, highways, and public
buildings, but that of propping under-ground all private habitations must be
defrayed by the proprietor. These ancient quarries had been much neglected, and
the means of visiting them was equally dangerous and inconvenient. At present,
every precaution is taken to insure the safety of the persons employed in them,
as well as the stability of their roof; and for the better superintendance of
all the subterraneous constructions of Paris, galleries of communication have
been formed of sufficient width to admit the free passage of materials
necessary for keeping them in repair.</p>
<p>Let us now find our way out of these labyrinths, and reascending to the
surface of the soil, pursue our examination of the Observatory.</p>
<p>In a large room on the first floor is traced the meridian line, which
divides this building into two parts. Thence, being extended to the south and
north, it crosses France from Colieure to Dunkirk.</p>
<p>On the pavement of one of the rooms is engraved a universal circular map, by
CHAZELLES and SÉDILLAN. Another room is called the <i>Salle aux secrets</i>,
because on applying the mouth to the groove of a pilaster, and whispering, a
person placed at the opposite pilaster hears what is said, while those in the
middle of the room, hear nothing. This phenomenon, the cause of which has been
so often explained, must be common to all buildings constructed in this
manner.</p>
<p>In speaking of the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, I mentioned that LALANDE obtained
the construction of an Observatory at the <i>ci-devant École Militaire</i>.
Since 1789, he and his nephew have discovered fifty thousand stars; an immense
labour, the greater part of them being telescopic and invisible to the naked
eye. Of this number, he has already classed thirty thousand.</p>
<p>The CASSINIS had neglected the Observatory in Paris; but when LALANDE was
director of this establishment, he obtained from BONAPARTE good instruments of
every description and of the largest dimensions. These have been executed by
the first artists, who, with the greatest intelligence, have put in practice
all the means of improvement which we owe to the fortunate discoveries of the
eighteenth century. Of course, it is now as well provided as that of Greenwich.
MÉCHAIN, the present director, and BOUVARD, his associate, are extremely
assiduous in their astronomical labours.</p>
<p>CARROCHÉ has made for this Observatory a twenty-two feet telescope, which
rivals those of HERSCHEL of the same length; and the use of reflecting circles,
imagined by MAYER, and brought into use by BORDA, which LENOIR executes in a
superior manner, and which we have not yet chosen to adopt in England, has
introduced into the observations of the French an accuracy hitherto unknown.
The meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona, measured between the years 1792 and
1798, by DELAMBRE and MÉCHAIN, is of an astonishing exactness. It has brought
to light the irregularity of the degrees, which was not suspected. The rules,
composed of platina and copper, which LAVOISIER and BORDA imagined for
measuring bases, without having occasion to calculate the effect of dilatation,
are a singular invention, and greatly surpass what RAMSDEN made for the bases
measured in England.</p>
<p>LAPLACE has discovered in the Moon inequalities with which we were not
acquainted. The work he has published, under the title of <i>Mécanique
Céleste</i>, contains the most astonishing discoveries of physical theory, the
great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, the acceleration of the Moon, the
equation of the third Satellite of Jupiter, and the flux and reflux of the
sea.</p>
<p>BURCKHARDT, one of the associated members of the <i>Bureau des
Longitudes</i>, is a first-rate astronomer and a man of superior talent. He is
at present employed on the difficult task of calculating the very considerable
derangements of the planet discovered by OLBERS at Bremen, on the 28th of March
1801.</p>
<p>VIDAL has made, at Mirepoix, more observations of Mercury than all the
astronomers for two thousand years past, and these are the most difficult and
uncommon.</p>
<p>DELAMBRE has computed tables of the Sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of
Herschel; LALANDE, the nephew, has composed tables of Mars; and his uncle, of
Mercury, which never deviate more than a few seconds from the observations.</p>
<p>Even during the reign of terror, astronomy was not neglected. Through the
interest of CARNOT, CALON, LAKANAL, and FOURCROY, the <i>Bureau de Consultation
des Arts</i> gave annually the sum of 300,000 francs (<i>circa</i> £12,000
sterling) in gratifications to artists.</p>
<p>Afterwards, in 1796, the National Institute, richly endowed, proposed
considerable premiums. LALANDE, the uncle, founded one for astronomy;
BONAPARTE, another for physics; and the First Consul has promised 60,000 francs
(<i>circa</i> £2,800 sterling) to any one who shall make a discovery of
importance.</p>
<p>France can now boast of two young geometricians, BIOT and PUISSON, who, for
analytical genius, surpass all that exist in Europe. It is rather extraordinary
that, with the exception of Mr. CAVENDISH and Dr. WARING, England has produced
no great geometricians since the death of MACLAURIN, STERLING, and SIMPSON.</p>
<p>The French tables of Logarithms, printed stereotypically, are cleared of all
the errors which afflicted calculators of every country. Those of other nations
will owe this obligation to Frenchmen.</p>
<p>HERSCHEL no longer looks for comets; but the French astronomers, MESSIER,
MÉCHAIN, BOUVARD, and PONS find some. Last year, JÉROME LALANDE deposited 600
francs in the hands of his notary, as a premium to stimulate the efforts of
young observers.</p>
<p class="right"><i>February 11, in continuation.</i></p>
<p>In the spring of 1803, MÉCHAIN will leave Paris for the purpose of extending
his meridian to the Balearic Islands. He will measure the length of the
pendulum in several places, in order to ascertain the inequality of the earth
which the measure of the degrees had indicated. This circumstance reminds me of
my neglect in not having yet satisfied your desire to have a short account of
the means employed for fixing the standard of the</p>
<p class="center">NEW FRENCH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.</p>
<p>Among the great ideas realized during the first period of the revolution,
must be reckoned that of a uniform system of weights and measures. From all
parts of France remonstrances were sent against the great variety of those in
use. Several kings had endeavoured to remedy this evil, which was so hurtful to
lawful trade, and favourable only to fraud and double-dealing. Yet what even
<i>they</i> had not been able to effect, was undertaken by the Constituent
Assembly. It declared that there ought to be but one standard of weights and
measures, in a country subject to the same laws. The <i>Academy of Sciences</i>
was charged to seek and present the best mode of carrying this decree into
execution. That society proposed the adoption of the decimal division, by
taking for a fundamental unit the ten-millionth part of the quarter of the
terrestrial meridian. The motives which determined this choice were the extreme
simplicity of decimal calculation, and the advantage of having a measure taken
from nature. The latter condition would, in truth, have been accomplished, had
there been taken, as a fundamental unit, the length of the pendulum marking
seconds for a given latitude; but the measure of an arc of the meridian,
executed with the precision to be obtained by the methods and instruments of
the present day, was extremely interesting in regard to the theory of the
figure of the earth. This influenced the decision of the Academy, and if the
motives which it presented to the Constituent Assembly were not exactly the
real ones, it is because the sciences have also their policy: it sometimes
happens that to serve mankind, one must resolve to deceive them.</p>
<p>All the measures of the metrical system, adopted by the Republic, are
deduced from a base taken from nature, the fourth part of the terrestrial
meridian; and the divisions of those measures are all subjected to the decimal
order employed in arithmetic.</p>
<p>In order to establish this base, the grand and important work of taking a
new measure of the terrestrial meridian, from Dunkirk to Barcelona, was begun
in 1792. At the expiration of seven years, it was terminated; and the Institute
presented the result to the Legislative Body with the original table of the new
measures.</p>
<p>MÉCHAIN and DELAMBRE measured the angles of ninety triangles with the new
reflecting circles; imagined by MAYER, and which BORDA had caused to be
constructed. With these instruments, they made four observations of latitude at
Dunkirk, Paris, Évaux, Carcassonne, and Barcelona; two bases measured near
Melun and Perpignan, with rules of platina and copper, forming metallic
thermometers, were connected with the triangles of the meridian line: the total
interval, which was 9&deg;.6738, was found to be 551584.72 toises. As the
degrees progressively diminished towards the south, but much more towards the
middle than towards the extremities, the middle of the whole arc was taken;
and, on comparing it with the degrees measured at Peru, between the years 1737
and 1741, the ellipticity of the earth was concluded to be 1/334 the mean
degree, 57008 toises; and the MÈTRE, which is the ten-millionth part of the
quarter of the meridian, 443.296 lines of the old French toise which had been
used at Peru.</p>
<p>The Commissioners, sent from foreign countries, verified all the
calculations, and sanctioned the results. The experiments of the pendulum made
at the observatory, with extreme care, by BORDA, MÉCHAIN, and CASSINI, with a
new apparatus, constructed by LENOIR, shewed the pendulum to be 0.99385 of the
<i>mètre</i>, on reducing it to the freezing point, and in <i>vacuo</i>: this
would be sufficient for finding again the <i>mètre</i>, though all the
standards were changed or lost.</p>
<p>Exact experiments, made by LEFÈVRE-GINEAU, with instruments constructed by
FORTIN, shewed the weight of the cubic decimetre of distilled water, at the
point of the greatest condensation to be 18827.15 grains of the pile of 50
marcs, which is preserved here in the <i>Hôtel de la Monnaie</i>, and is called
<i>Le poids de Charlemagne</i>; the toise being supposed at 13 degrees of the
thermometer of 80 degrees. The scales of FORTIN might give a millionth part and
more; and LEFÈVRE-GINEAU employed in all these experiments and calculations the
most scrupulous degree of exactness.</p>
<p>Thus the MÈTRE or principal unit of the French linear measures has furnished
those of the weights; and all this grand system, taken from nature, is
connected with the base the most invariable, the size of the earth itself.</p>
<p>The unit of the measures of capacity is a cube whose side is the tenth part
of the <i>mètre</i>, to which has been given the name of LITRE; the unit of
measures of solidity, relative to wood, a cube whose side is the <i>mètre</i>,
which is called STÈRE. In short, the thousandth part of a <i>litre</i> of
distilled water, weighed in <i>vacuo</i> and at the temperature of melting ice,
has been chosen for the unit of weights, which is called GRAMME.</p>
<p>The following TABLE presents the nomenclature of these different Measures,
their divisions, and multiples, together with the new Weights, as decreed by
the Legislative Body, and to it is annexed their correspondence both with the
old French Measures and Weights, and those of England.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 14, 1802.</i></p>
<p>After speaking of the <i>Board of Longitude</i> and the <i>National
Observatory</i>, I must not omit to say a few words of an establishment much
wanted in England. I mean the</p>
<p class="center">DÉPÔT DE LA MARINE.</p>
<p>This general repository of maps, charts, plans, journals, and archives of
the Navy and the Colonies, is under the direction of a flag-officer. It is
situated in the <i>Rue de la Place Vendôme</i>; but the archives are still kept
in an office at Versailles. To this <i>Dépôt</i> are attached the Hydrographer
and Astronomer of the Navy, both members of the National Institute and of the
Board of Longitude, and also a number of engineers and draughtsmen proportioned
to the works which the government orders to be executed.</p>
<p>The title of this <i>Dépôt</i> sufficiently indicates what it contains. To
it has been lately added a library, composed of all the works relative to
navigation, hydrography, naval architecture, and to the navy in general, as
well as of all the voyages published in the different dead or living languages.
The collection of maps, charts, plans, &amp;c. belonging to it, is composed of
originals in manuscript, ancient and modern, of French or foreign sea-charts,
published at different times, and of maps of the possessions beyond the seas
belonging to the maritime states of Europe and to the United-States of
America.</p>
<p>All the commanders of vessels belonging to the State are bound, on their
return to port, to address to the Minister of the Naval Department, in order to
be deposited in the archives, the journals of their voyage, and the
astronomical or other observations which they have been enabled to make, and
the charts and plans which they have had an opportunity of constructing.</p>
<p>One of the apartments of the <i>Dépôt</i> contains models of ships of war
and other vessels, the series of which shews the progress of naval architecture
for two centuries past, and the models of the different machines employed in
the ports for the various operations relative to building, equipping,
repairing, and keeping in order ships and vessels of war.</p>
<p>The <i>Dépôt de la Marine</i> publishes new sea-charts in proportion as new
observations or discoveries indicate the necessity of suppressing or rectifying
the old ones. </p>
<p>When the service requires it, the engineers belonging to the <i>Dépôt</i>
are detached to verify parts of the coasts of the French territory in Europe,
or in any other part of the world, where experience has proved that time has
introduced changes with which it is important to be acquainted, or to rectify
the charts of other parts that had not yet been surveyed with the degree of
exactness of which the methods now known and practised have rendered such works
susceptible.</p>
<p>In the French navy, commanders of ships and vessels are supplied with useful
charts and atlases of every description, at the expense of the nation. These
are delivered into their care previously to the ship leaving port. When a
captain is superseded in his command, he transfers them to his successor; and
when the ship is put out of commission, they are returned to the proper office.
Why does not the British government follow an example so justly deserving of
imitation?</p>
<h2><a name="let68">LETTER LXVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 15, 1802.</i></p>
<p>After the beautiful theatre of the old <i>Comédie Française</i>, under its
new title of <i>l'Odéon</i>, became a prey to flames, as I have before
mentioned, the comedians belonging it were dispersed on all sides. At length,
PICARD assembled a part of them in a house, built at the beginning of the
revolution, which, from the name of the street where it is situated, is called
the</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE LOUVOIS.</p>
<p>No colonnade, no exterior decoration announces it as a place of public
amusement, and any one might pass it at noon-day without suspecting the
circumstance, but for the prices of admission being painted in large characters
over the apertures in the wall, where the public deposit their money.</p>
<p>This house, which is of a circular form, is divided, into four tiers of
boxes. The ornaments in front of them, not being in glaring colours, give, by
their pale tint, a striking brilliancy to the dress of the women.</p>
<p>PICARD, the manager of this theatre, is the MOLIÈRE of his company; that is,
he is at once author and actor, and, in both lines, indefatigable. Undoubtedly,
the most striking, and, some say, the only resemblance he bears to the mirror
of French comedy, is to be compelled to bring on the stage pieces in so
unfinished a state as to be little more than sketches, or, in other words, he
is forced to write in order to subsist his company. Thus then, the stock-pieces
of this theatre are all of them of his own composition. The greater part are
<i>imbroglios</i> bordering on farce. The <i>vis comica</i> to be found in them
is not easily understood by foreigners, since it chiefly consists in allusions
to local circumstances and sayings of the day. However, they sometimes produce
laughter in a surprising degree, but more frequently make those laugh who never
blush to laugh at any thing.</p>
<p>The most lively of his pieces are <i>Le Collatéral</i> and <i>la Petite
Ville</i>. In the course of last month, he produced one under the name of <i>La
Grande Ville, ou les Provinciaux à Paris</i>, which occasioned a violent
uproar. The characters of this pseudo-comedy are swindlers or fools; and the
spectators insisted that the portraits were either too exact a copy of the
originals, or not at all like them. <a name="let68fr1"></a>By means of much
insolence, by means of the guard which was incautiously introduced into the
pit, and which put to flight the majority of the audience, and, lastly, by
means of several alterations, PICARD contrived to get his piece endured. But
this triumph may probably be the signal of his ruin,[<a href="#let68f1">1</a>]
as the favour of the Parisian public, once lost, is never to be regained.</p>
<p>This histrionic author and manager has written some pieces of a serious
cast. The principal are, <i>Médiocre et Rampant</i>, and <i>L'Entrée dans le
Monde</i>. As in <i>La Grande Ville</i>, the characters in these are also
cheats or fools. Consequently, it was not difficult to conduct the plot, it
would have been much more so to render it interesting. These two comedies are
written in verse which might almost pass for prose.</p>
<p>The <i>Théâtre Louvois</i> is open to all young authors who have the
ambition to write for the stage, before they have well stored their mind with
the requisites. Novelties here succeed each other with astonishing rapidity.
Hence, whatever success PICARD may have met with as an author, he has not been
without competitors for his laurels. Out of no less than one hundred and
sixty-seven pieces presented for rehearsal and read at this house, one hundred
and sixty-five are said to have been refused. Of the two accepted, the one,
though written forty years ago, was brought out as a new piece, and damned.
However, the ill success of a piece represented here is not remarked; the fall
not being great.</p>
<p>The friends of this theatre call it <i>La petite Maison de Thalie</i>. They
take the part for the whole. It is, in fact, no more than her anti-chamber. As
for the drawing-room of the goddess, it is no longer to be found any where in
Paris.</p>
<p>The performers who compose PICARD'S company do no injustice to his pieces.
It is affirmed that this company has what is called, on the French stage, <i>de
l'ensemble</i>. With few exceptions, there is an <i>ensemble</i>, as it is very
indifferent. For such an interpretation to be correct, it would be necessary
for all the comedians of the <i>Théâtre Louvois</i> to have great talents, and
none can be quoted.</p>
<p>PICARD, though not unfrequently applauded, is but a sorry actor. His cast of
parts is that of valets and comic characters.</p>
<p>DEVIGNY performs the parts of noble fathers and foolish ones, here termed
<i>dindons</i>, and grooms, called by the French <i>jockeis</i>. The remark,
that he who plays every thing plays nothing, has not been unaptly applied to
him. He has a defect of pronunciation which shocks even the ear of a
foreigner.</p>
<p>DORSAN is naturally cold and stiff, and when he endeavours to repair the
former of these defects, the weakness of his powers betrays him. If he speaks
correctly, it is without <i>finesse</i>, and he never adds by expression to the
thought of the author.</p>
<p>CLOZEL is a very handsome young man. He performs the characters of
<i>petits-maîtres</i> and those of valets, which he confounds incessantly. The
other actors of the <i>Théâtre Louvois</i> exempt me from naming them.</p>
<p>As for the actresses at this theatre, those only worthy to be mentioned are,
Mademoiselle ADELINE, who has a rather pretty face, and plays not ill innocent
parts; Mademoiselle BEFFROI, who is handsome, especially in male attire; and
Mademoiselle MOLIÈRE, who is a very good <i>soubrette</i>. Mademoiselle LESCOT,
tired of obtaining applause at the <i>Théâtre du Vaudeville</i>, wished to do
the same on a larger theatre. Here, she has not even the consolation of
saying</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Tel brille au second rang, qui s'éclipse au premier.</i>"</p>
<p>Madame MOLÉ, who is enormous in bulk, is a coarse caricature, whether she
performs the parts of noble mothers, or what the French call <i>caractères</i>,
that is, singular characters.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>The <i>ci-devant Comédie Italienne</i> in Paris partly owed its prosperity
to the <i>Vaudeville</i>, which might be considered as the parent of the
<i>Opéra-Comique</i>. They were united, when the <i>drame</i> being introduced
with songs, had like to have annihilated them both. The <i>Vaudeville</i> was
sacrificed and banished. Several years elapsed before it reappeared. This
offspring of French gaiety was thought to be lost for ever; but a few authors
had prepared for it an asylum under the name of</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE DU VAUDEVILLE.</p>
<p>This little theatre is situated in the <i>Rue de Chartres</i>, which faces
the principal entrance of the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>. The interior is of a
circular form, and divided into four tiers of boxes. In general, the
decorations are not of the first class, but in the dresses the strictest
propriety is observed.</p>
<p><a name="let68fr2"></a>The pieces performed at the <i>Vaudeville</i> are
little comedies of the sentimental cast, a very extensive collection of
portraits of French authors and of a few foreigners,[<a href="#let68f2">2</a>]
some pastoral pieces, parodies closely bordering on the last new piece
represented at one of the principal theatres, charming <i>harlequinades</i>,
together with a few pieces, in some of which parade and show are introduced; in
others, scenes of low life and vulgarity; but the latter species is now almost
abandoned.</p>
<p>These pieces are almost always composed in conjunction. It is by no means
uncommon to see in the play-bills the names of five or six authors to a piece,
in which the public applaud, perhaps, no more than three verses of a song. This
association of names, however, has the advantage of saving many of them from
ridicule.</p>
<p>The authors who chiefly devote themselves to the species of composition from
which this theatre derives its name, are BARRÉ, RADET, and DESFONTAINES, who
may be considered as its founders. BOURGEUIL, DESCHAMPS, DESPREZ, and the two
SÉGURS, also contribute to the success of the <i>Vaudeville</i>, together with
CHAZET, JOUY, LONGCHAMPS, and some others.</p>
<p>In the exercise of their talents, these writers suffer no striking
adventure, no interesting anecdote to escape their satirical humour; but aim
the shafts of ridicule at every subject likely to afford amusement. It may
therefore be conceived that this house is much frequented. No people on earth
can be more fickle than the French in general, and the Parisians in particular,
in the choice of their diversions. Like children, they are soon tired of the
same toy, and novelty is for them the greatest attraction. Hence, the
<i>Vaudeville</i>, as has been seen, presents a great variety of pieces. In
general, these are by no means remarkable for the just conception of their
plan. The circumstance of the moment adroitly seized, and related in some
well-turned stanzas, interspersed with dialogue, is sufficient to insure the
success of a new piece, especially if adapted to the abilities of the
respective performers.</p>
<p>Among them, HENRY would shine in the parts of lovers, were he less of a
<i>mannerist</i>.</p>
<p>JULIEN may be quoted as an excellent imitator of the beaux of the day.</p>
<p>VERTPRÉ excels in personating a striking character.</p>
<p>CARPENTIER is no bad representative of a simpleton.</p>
<p>CHAPELLE displays much comic talent and warmth in the character of dotards,
who talk themselves out of their reason.</p>
<p>LAPORTE, as a speaking Harlequin, has no equal in Paris.</p>
<p>So much for the men: I shall now speak of the women deserving of notice.</p>
<p>Madame HENRY, in the parts of lovers, is to be preferred for her fine eyes,
engaging countenance, elegant shape, and clear voice.</p>
<p>Mesdemoiselles COLOMBE and LAPORTE, who follow her in the same line of
acting, are both young, and capable of improvement.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle DESMARES is far from being pretty; neither is she much of an
actress, but she treads the stage well, and sings not amiss.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle BLOSSEVILLE plays chambermaids and characters of parody with
tolerable success.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle DELILLE, however, who performs caricatures and characters where
frequent disguises are assumed, is a still greater favourite with the public.
So much has been said of the glibness of a female tongue that many of the
comparisons made on the subject are become proverbial; but nothing that I ever
heard in that way can be compared to the volubility of utterance of
Mademoiselle DELILLE, except the clearness of her articulation. A quick and
attentive ear may catch every syllable as distinctly as if she spoke with the
utmost gravity and slowness. The piece in which she exhibits this talent to
great advantage, and under a rapid succession of disguises, is called
<i>Frosine ou la dernière venue</i>.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle FLEURY makes an intelligent Columbine, not unworthy of LAPORTE.
</p>
<p>Madame DUCHAUME represents not ill characters of duennas, country-women,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Nothing can be said of the voice of the different performers of this
theatre, on which acccount, perhaps, the orchestra is rather feeble; but still
it might be better composed. </p>
<p>During my present visit to Paris, the <i>Vaudeville</i>, as it is commonly
called, has, I think, insensibly declined. It has, however, been said that its
destiny seems insured by the character of the French, and that being the first
theatre to bend to the caprices of the day, it can never be out of fashion.
Certainly, if satire be a good foundation, it ought to be the most substantial
dramatic establishment in Paris. It rests on public malignity, which is its
main support. Hence, one might conclude that it will last as long as there is
evil doing or evil saying, an absurdity to catch at, an author to parody, a
tale of scandal to relate, a rogue to abuse, and, in short, as long as the
chapter of accidents shall endure. At this rate, the <i>Vaudeville</i> must
stand to all eternity.</p>
<p>Whatever may be its defects, it unquestionably exemplifies the character of
the nation, so faithfully pourtrayed by Beaumarchais, in the following lines of
the <i>vaudeville</i> which concludes the <i>Mariage de Figaro</i>:</p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Si l'on opprime, il peste, il crie,<br />

<h2><a name="let69">LETTER LXIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 17, 1802.</i></p>
<p>After having traversed the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, from the north side of the
Seine, you cannot avoid noticing a handsome building to the right, situated on
the <i>Quai de Conti</i>, facing the river. This is the Mint, or</p>
<p class="center">HÔTEL DE LA MONNAIE.</p>
<p>The construction of this edifice was suggested by M. LAVERDY, Minister of
State, and executed under the direction of M. ANTOINE, architect. I do not
recollect any building of the kind in Europe that can be compared to it, since
it far surpasses the <i>Zecca</i> at Venice.</p>
<p>The Abbé Terray (whose name will not be readily forgotten by the
State-annuitants of his time, and for whom Voltaire, as one, said that he
preserved his only tooth) when Comptroller-general of the Finances, laid the
first stone of the <i>Hôtél de la Monnaie</i>, in April 1771.</p>
<p>An avant-corps, decorated with six Ionic pillars, and supported by two
wings, from the division of the façade, which is three hundred and thirty-six
feet in breadth by eighty-four in elevation. It is distributed into two stories
above the ground-floor. Perpendicularly to the six pillars, rise six statues,
representing Peace, Commerce, Prudence, Law, Strength, and Plenty.</p>
<p>In this avant-corps are three arches, the centre one of which is the
principal entrance of the building. The vestibule is decorated with twenty-four
fluted Doric pillars, and on the right hand, is a stair-case, leading to the
apartments intended for the use of the officers belonging to the Mint, and in
which they hold their meetings. This stair-case is lighted by a dome supported
by sixteen fluted pillars of the Ionic order.</p>
<p>The whole building contains six courts: the principal court is one hundred
and ten feet in depth by ninety-two in breadth. All round it are covered
galleries, terminated by a circular wall alternately pierced with arches and
gates.</p>
<p>The entrance of the hall for the money-presses is ornamented by four Doric
pillars. This hall is sixty-two feet long by about forty broad, and contains
nine money-presses. Above it is the hall of the sizers or persons who prepare
the blank pieces for stamping. Next come the flatting-mills. Here, in a word,
are all the apartments necessary for the different operations, and aptly
arranged for the labours of coinage.</p>
<p>In the principal apartment of the avant-corps of the <i>Hôtel de la
Monnaie</i>, towards the <i>Quai de Cont</i>i, is the cabinet known in Paris by
the name of the</p>
<p class="center">MUSÉE DES MINES.</p>
<p>This cabinet or Museum was formed in 1778 by M. SAGE, who had then spent
eighteen years in collecting minerals. When he began to employ himself on that
science forty-five years ago, there existed in this country no collection which
could facilitate the study of mineralogy. Docimacy vas scarcely known here by
name. France was tributary to foreign countries thirty-seven millions of livres
(<i>circa</i> £1,541,666 sterling) a year for the mineral and metallic
substances which she drew from them, although she possesses them within
herself. M. SAGE directed his studies and labours to the research and analysis
of minerals. For twenty years he has delivered <i>gratis</i> public courses of
chymistry and mineralogy. For the advancement of those sciences, he also
availed himself of the favour he enjoyed with some persons at court and in the
ministry, and this was certainly making a very meritorious use of it. To his
care and interest is wholly due the collection of minerals placed in this
building. The apartment containing it has, by some, been thought to deviate
from the simple and severe style suitable to its destination, and to resemble
too much the drawing-room of a fine lady. But those who have hazarded such a
reproach do not consider that, at the period when this cabinet was formed, it
was not useless, in order to bring the sciences into fashion, to surround them
with the show of luxury and the elegance of accessory decoration. Who knows
even whether that very circumstance, trifling as it may appear, has not
somewhat contributed to spread a taste for the two sciences in question among
the great, and in the fashionable world?</p>
<p>However this may be, the arrangement of this cabinet is excellent, and, in
that respect, it is worthy to serve as a model. The productions of nature are
so disposed that the glazed closets and cases containing them present, as it
were, an open book in which the curious and attentive observer instructs
himself with the greater facility and expedition, as he can without effort
examine and study perfectly every individual specimen.</p>
<p>The inside of the Museum is about forty-five feet in length, thirty-eight in
breadth, and forty in elevation. In the middle is an amphitheatre capable of
holding two hundred persons. In the circumference are glazed cabinets or
closets, in which are arranged methodically and analytically almost all the
substances known in mineralogy. The octagonal gallery, above the elliptical
amphitheatre, contains large specimens of different minerals. To each specimen
is annexed an explanatory ticket. One of the large lateral galleries presents
part of the productions of the mines of France, classed according to the order
of the departments where they are found. The new transversal gallery contains
models of furnaces and machines employed in the working of mines. The third
gallery is also destined to contain the minerals of France, the essays and
results of which are deposited in a private cabinet. The galleries are
decorated with tables and vases of different species of marble, porphyry, and
granite, also from the mines of France, collected by SAGE. The cupola which
rises above, is elegantly ornamented from the designs of ANTOINE, the architect
of the building. </p>
<p>This Museum is open to the public every day from nine o'clock in the morning
till two, and, though it has been so many years an object of curiosity, such is
the care exerted in superintending it, that it has all the freshness of
novelty.</p>
<p>In a niche, on the first landing-place of the stair-case, is the bust of M.
SAGE, a tribute of gratitude paid to him by his pupils. SAGE'S principal object
being to naturalize in France mineralogy, docimacy, and metallurgy, he first
obtained the establishment of a <i>Special School of Mines</i>, in which pupils
were maintained by the State. Here, he directed their studies, and enjoyed the
happiness of forming intelligent men, capable of improving the science of
metallurgy, and promoting the search of ores, &amp;c.</p>
<p>For a number of years past, as I have already observed, SAGE has delivered
<i>gratis</i>, in this Museum; public courses of chymistry and mineralogy. He
attracts hither many auditors by the ease of his elocution, and the address,
the grace even which he displays in his experiments. If all those who have
attended his lectures are to be reckoned his pupils, there will be found in the
number names illustrious among the <i>savans</i> of France. Unfortunately, this
veteran of science has created for himself a particular system in chymistry,
and this system differs from that of LAVOISIER, FOURCROY, GUYTON-MORVEAU,
BERTHOLLET, CHAPTAL, &amp;c. The sciences have also their schisms; but the real
<i>savans</i> are not persecutors. Although SAGE was not of their opinion on
many essential points, his adversaries always respected him as the man who had
first drawn the attention of the government towards the art of mines,
instigated the establishment of the first school which had existed for this
important object, and been the author of several good analyses. On coming out
of prison, into which he had been thrown during the reign of terror, he found
this cabinet of mineralogy untouched. It would then have been easy, from
motives of public utility, to unite it to the new School of Mines. But the
heads of this new school had, for the most part, issued from the old one, and
SAGE was dear to them from every consideration. It was from a consequence of
this sentiment that SAGE, who had been a member of the <i>Academy of
Sciences</i>, not having been comprised in the list of the members of the
National Institute at the time of its formation, has since been admitted into
that learned body, not as a chymist indeed, but as a professor of mineralogy, a
science which owes to him much of its improvement.</p>
<p>The new School of Mines is now abolished, and practical ones are established
in the mountains, as I have before mentioned. While I am speaking of
mineralogy, I shall take you to view the</p>
<p class="center">CABINET DU CONSEIL DES MINES.</p>
<p>This cabinet of mineralogy, formed at the <i>Hôtel des Mines</i>, <i>Rue de
l'Université</i>, <i>No. 293</i>, is principally intended to present a complete
collection of all the riches of the soil of the French Republic, arranged in
local order. A succession of glazed closets, contiguous and similar to each
other, that is about six feet and a half in height by sixteen inches in depth,
affords every facility of observing them with ease and convenience. On these
cases the names of the departments are inscribed in alphabetical order, and the
vacancies which still exist in this geographical collection, are daily filled
up by specimens sent by the engineers of mines, who, being spread over the
different districts they are charged to visit, employ themselves in recognizing
carefully the mineral substances peculiar to each country, in order to submit
their views to the government respecting the means of rendering them useful to
commerce and to the arts.</p>
<p>The departmental collection, being thus arranged on the sides of the
gallery, leaves vacant the middle of the apartments, which is furnished with
tables covered with large glazed cases, intended for receiving systematic
collections, and the most remarkable mineral substances from foreign countries,
distributed in geographical order.</p>
<p>An apartment is specially appropriated to the systematic order adopted by
HAÜY in his new treatise on mineralogy; another is reserved for the method of
WERNER.</p>
<p>In both these oryctognostic collections, minerals of all countries are
indiscriminately admitted. They are arranged by <i>classes</i>, <i>orders</i>,
<i>genera</i>, <i>species</i>, and <i>varieties</i>, with the denominations
adopted by the author of the method, and consequently designated by specific
names in French for HAÜY'S method, and in German for that of WERNER. The
proximity of the two apartments where they are exhibited, affords every
advantage for comparing both methods, and acquiring an exact knowledge of
mineralogical synonymy. Each of the two methods contains also a geological
collection of rocks and various aggregates, classed and named after the
principles which their respective authors have thought fit to adopt.</p>
<p>The other apartments are likewise furnished with tables covered with glazed
cases, where are exhibited, in a manner very advantageous for study, the most
remarkable minerals of every description from foreign countries, among which
are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>A numerous series of minerals from Russia, such as red chromate of lead,
white carbonate of lead, green phosphate of lead; native copper, green and blue
carbonate of copper; gold ore from Berezof; iron ore, granitical rocks, fossil
shells, in good preservation, from the banks of the Moscorika, and others in
the siliceous state, jaspers, crystals of quartz, beril, &amp;c.</li>
<li>A collection from the iron and copper mines of Sweden, as well as various
crystals and rocks from the same country.</li>
<li>A very complete and diversified collection of minerals from the country of
Saltzburg.</li>
<li>Another of substances procured in England, such as fluates and carbonates
of lime from Derbyshire; pyrites, copper and lead ore, zinc, and tin from
Cornwall.</li>
<li>A collection of tin ore, cobalt, uranite, &amp;c. from Saxony. </li>
<li>A series of minerals from Simplon, St. Gothard, the Tyrol, Transylvania, as
well as from Egypt and America. All these articles, without being striking from
their size, and other accessory qualities to be remarked in costly specimens,
incontestably present a rich fund of instruction to persons delirous of
fathoming science, by multiplying the points of view under which mineral
productions may be observed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such is the present state of the mineralogical collection of the <i>Conseil
des Mines</i>, which the superintendants will, no doubt, with time and
attention, bring to the highest degree of perfection. It is open to the public
every Monday and Thursday: but, on the other days of the week, amateurs and
students have access to it.</p>
<p>A few years before the revolution, France was still considered as destitute
of an infinite number of mineral riches, which were thought to belong
exclusively to several of the surrounding countries. Germany was quoted as a
country particularly favoured, in this respect, by Nature. Yet France is
crossed by mountains similar to those met with in Germany, and these mountains
contain rocks of the same species as those of that country which is so rich in
minerals. What has happened might therefore have been foreseen; namely, that,
when intelligent men, with an experienced eye, should examine the soil of the
various departments of the Republic, they would find in it not only substances
hitherto considered as scarce, but even several of those whose existence there
had not yet been suspected. Since the revolution, the following are the</p>
<p><i>Principal Mineral Substances discovered in France.</i></p>
<p><i>Dolomite</i> in the mountains of Vosges and in the Pyrenees.</p>
<p><i>Carburet of iron</i> or <i>plumbago</i>, in the south peak of Bigorre.
The same variety has been been found near Argentière, and the valley of
Chamouny, department of Mont-Blanc.</p>
<p>A rock of the appearance of <i>porphyry</i>, with a <i>calcareous</i> base,
in the same valley of Chamouny.</p>
<p><i>Tremolite</i> or <i>grammatite</i> of HAÜY, in the same place. These two
last-mentioned substances were in terminated crystals.</p>
<p><i>Red oxyd of titanium</i>, in the same place.</p>
<p><i>New violet schorl</i>, or <i>sphene</i> of HAÜY, (<i>rayonnante en
goutière</i> of SAUSSURE) in the same place.</p>
<p><i>Crystallized sulphate of strontia</i>, in the mines of Villefort in La
Lozère, in the environs of Paris, at Bartelemont, near the <i>Salterns</i> in
the department of La Meurthe. </p>
<p><i>Fibrous and crystallized sulphate of strontia</i>, at Bouvron, near
Toul.</p>
<p><i>Earthy sulphate of strontia</i>, in the vicinity of Paris, near the
forest of Montmorency, and to the north-east of it.</p>
<p><i>Onyx-agate-quartz</i>, at Champigny, in the department of La Seine.</p>
<p><i>Avanturine-quartz</i>, in the Deux-Sevres.</p>
<p><i>Marine bodies</i>, imbedded in the soil, a little above the <i>Oule de
Gavernie</i>.</p>
<p><i>Anthracite</i>, and its direction determined in several departments.</p>
<p><i>Other marine bodies</i>, at the height of upwards of 3400 <i>mètres</i>
or 3683 yards, on the summit of Mont-Perdu, in the Upper Pyrenées.</p>
<p><i>Wolfram</i>, near St. Yriex, in Upper Vienne.</p>
<p><i>Oxyd of antimony</i>, at Allemont, in the department of L'Isère.</p>
<p><i>Chromate of iron</i>, near Gassin, in the department of <i>Le Var</i>, at
the <i>bastide</i> of the cascade.</p>
<p><i>Oxyd of uranite</i>, at St. Simphorien de Marmagne, in the department of
La Côte d'Or.</p>
<p><i>Acicular arsenical lead ore</i>, at St. Prix, in the department of Saone
and Loire. This substance was found among some piles of rubbish, near old works
made for exploring a vein of lead ore, which lies at the foot of a mountain to
the north-east, and at three quarters of a league from the <i>commune</i> of
St. Prix.</p>
<p>In this country have likewise been found several varieties of new
interesting forms relative to substances already known; several important
geological facts have been ascertained; and, lastly, the emerald has here been
recently discovered. France already possesses eighteen of the twenty-one
metallic substances known. Few countries inherit from Nature the like
advantages.</p>
<p>With respect to the administration of the mines of France, the
under-mentioned are the regulations now in force.</p>
<p>A council composed of three members, is charged to give to the Minister of
the Interior ideas, together with their motives, respecting every thing that
relates to mines. It corresponds, in the terms of the law, with all the
grantees and with all persons who explore mines, salterns, and quarries. It
superintends the research and extraction of all substances drawn from the bosom
of the earth, and their various management. It proposes the grants,
permissions, and advances to be made, and the encouragements to be given. Under
its direction are the two practical schools, and twenty-five engineers of
mines, nine of whom are spread over different parts of the French territory.
General information relative to statistics, every thing that can concur in the
formation of the mineralogical map of France and complete the collection of her
minerals, and all observations and memoirs relative to the art of mines or of
the different branches of metallurgy, are addressed by the engineers to the
<i>Conseil des Mines</i> at Paris.</p>
<h2><a name="let70">LETTER LXX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 20, 1802</i>.</p>
<p><a name="let70fr1"></a>Having fully described to you all the theatres here
of the first and second rank, I shall confine myself to a rapid sketch of those
which may be classed in the third order.[<a href="#let70f1">1</a>]</p>
<p class="center">THÉÂTRE MONTANSIER.</p>
<p>This house stands at the north-west angle of the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>.
It is of an oval form, and contains three tiers of boxes, exclusively of a
large amphitheatre. Before the revolution, it bore the name of <i>Théâtre des
Petits Comédiens du Comte de Beaujolais</i>, and was famous for the novelty of
the spectacle here given. Young girls and boys represented little comedies and
comic operas in the following manner. Some gesticulated on the stage; while
others, placed in the side-scenes, spoke or sang their parts without being
seen. It was impossible to withhold one's admiration from the perfect harmony
between the motions of the one and the speaking and singing of the other. In
short, this double acting was executed with such precision that few strangers
detected the deception.</p>
<p>To these actors succeeded full-grown performers, who have since continued to
play interludes of almost every description. Indeed, this theatre is the
receptacle of all the nonsense imaginable; nothing is too absurd or too low for
its stage. Here are collected all the trivial expressions to be met with in
this great city, whether made use of in the markets, gaming-houses, taverns, or
dancing-rooms.</p>
<p>CAROLINE and BRUNET, or BRUNET and CAROLINE. They are like two planets,
round which move a great number of satellites, some more imperceptible than
others. If to these we add TIERCELIN, an actor of the grotesque species, little
more is to be said. Were it not for BRUNET, who makes the most of his comic
humour, in playing all sorts of low characters, and sometimes in a manner truly
original, and Mademoiselle CAROLINE, whose clear, flexible, and sonorous voice
insures the success of several little operas, the <i>Théâtre Montansier</i>
would not be able to maintain its ground, notwithstanding the advantages of its
centrical situation, and the attractions of its lobby, where the impures of the
environs exhibit themselves to no small advantage, and literally carry all
before them.</p>
<p>We now come to the theatres on the <i>Boulevard</i>, at the head of which is
to be placed</p>
<p class="center">L'AMBIGU COMIQUE.</p>
<p>This little theatre is situated on the <i>Boulevard du Temple</i>, and, of
all those of the third order, has most constantly enjoyed the favour of the
public. Previously to the revolution, AUDINOT drew hither crowded houses by the
representation of comic operas and bad <i>drames</i> of a gigantic nature,
called here <i>pantomimes dialoguées</i>. The effects of decoration and show
were carried farther at this little theatre than at any other. Ghosts,
hobgoblins, and devils were, in the sequel, introduced. All Paris ran to see
them, till the women were terrified, and the men disgusted.</p>
<p>CORSE, the present manager, has of late added considerably to the attraction
of the <i>Ambigu Comique</i>, by not only restoring it to what it was in the
most brilliant days of AUDINOT, but by collecting all the best actors and
dancers of the <i>Boulevard</i>, and improving on the plan adopted by his
predecessor. He has neglected nothing necessary for the advantageous execution
of the new pieces which he has produced. The most attractive of these are
<i>Victor</i>, <i>le Pélerin blanc</i>, <i>L'Homme à trois visages</i>, <i>Le
Jugement de Salomon</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The best performers at this theatre are CORSE, the manager, TAUTIN, and
Mademoiselle LEVESQUE.</p>

<p><a name="let70fr2"></a>In regard to all the other minor theatres, the
enumeration of which I have detailed to you in a preceding
letter,[<a href="#let70f2">2</a>] I shall briefly, observe that the curiosity
of a stranger may be satisfied in paying each of them a single visit. Some of
these <i>petits spectacles</i> are open one day, shut the next, and soon after
reopened with performances of a different species. Therefore, to attempt a
description of their attractions would probably be superfluous; and, indeed,
the style of the pieces produced is varied according to the ideas of the
speculators, the taste of the managers, or the abilities of the performers,
who, if not "the best actors in the world," are ready to play either "tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, scene

<h2><a name="let71">LETTER LXXI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 22, 1802.</i></p>
<p>The variety of matter which crowds itself on the mind of a man who attempts
to describe this immense capital, forms such a chaos, that you will, I trust,
give me credit for the assertion, when I assure you that it is not from neglect
or inattention I sometimes take more time than may appear strictly necessary to
comply with your wishes. Considering how deeply it involves the peace and
comfort of strangers, as well as inhabitants, I am not at all surprised at the
anxiety which you express to acquire some knowledge of the</p>
<p class="center">POLICE OF PARIS.</p>
<p>In the present existing circumstances, it might be imprudent, if not
dangerous, to discuss, freely openly, so delicate a question. I shall take a
middle course. Silence would imply fear; while boldness of expression might
give offence; and though I certainly am not afraid to mention the subject, yet
to offend, is by no means my wish or intention. In this country, the
Post-Office has often been the channel through which the opinion of individuals
has been collected. What has been, may again occur; and in such critical times,
who knows, but the government may conceive itself justified in not considering
as absolutely sacred the letters intrusted to that mode of conveyance? Under
these considerations, I shall beg leave to refer you to a work which has gone
through the hands of every inquisitive reader; that is the <i>Tableau de
Paris</i>, published in 1788: but, on recollection, as this letter will,
probably, find you in the country, where you may not have an immediate
opportunity of gratifying your curiosity, and as the book is become scarce, I
shall select from it for your satisfaction a few extracts concerning the
Police.</p>
<p>This establishment is necessary and useful for maintaining order and
tranquillity in a city like Paris, where the very extremes of luxury and
wretchedness are continually in collision. I mean <i>useful</i>, when no abuse
is made of its power; and it is to be hoped that the present government of
France is too wise and too just to convert an institution of public utility
into an instrument of private oppression.</p>
<p>Since the machinery of the police was first put in order by M. D'ARGENSON,
in 1697, its wheels and springs have been continually multiplied by the
thirteen ministers who succeeded him in that department. The last of these was
the celebrated M. LENOIR.</p>
<p>The present Minister of the Police, M. FOUCHÉ, has, it seems, adopted, in a
great measure, the means put in practice before the revolution.
<a name="let71fr1"></a>His administration, according to general report, bears
most resemblance to that of M. LENOIR: he is said, however, to have improved on
that vigilant magistrate: but he surpasses him, I am told, more in augmentation
of expenses and agents, than in real changes.[<a href="#let71f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>In selecting from the before-mentioned work the following <i>widely
scattered</i> passages, and assembling them as a <i>piece of Mosaic</i>, it has
been my endeavour to enable you to form an impartial judgment of the police of
Paris, by exhibiting it with all its perfections and imperfections. Borrowing
the language of MERCIER, I shall trace the institution through all its
ramifications, and, in pointing out its effects, I shall "nothing extenuate,
nor set down aught in malice."</p>
<p>If we take it for granted, that the police of Paris is now exercised on the
same plan as that pursued towards the close of the old <i>régime</i>, this
sketch will be the more interesting, as its resemblance to the original will
exempt me from adding a single stroke from my own pencil.</p>
<p>"D'ARGENSON was severe," says MERCIER, "perhaps because he felt, in first
setting the machine in motion, a resistance which his successors have less
experienced. For a long time it was imagined that a Minister of Police ought to
be harsh; he ought to be firm only. <a name="let71fr2"></a>Several of these
magistrates have laid on too heavy a hand, because they were not acquainted
with the people of Paris; a people of quick feeling, but not
ferocious,[<a href="#let71f2">2</a>] whose motions are to be divined, and
consequently easy to be led. Whoever should be void of pity in that post, would
be a monster."</p>
<p>MERCIER then gives the fragment by FONTENELLE, on the police of Paris and on
M. D'ARGENSON, of which I shall select only what may be necessary for
elucidating the main subject.</p>
<p>"The inhabitants of a well-governed city," says FONTENELLE, "enjoy the good
order which is there established, without considering what trouble it costs
those who establish or preserve it, much in the same manner as all mankind
enjoy the regularity of the motions of celestial bodies, without having any
knowledge of them, and even the more the good order of a police resembles by
its uniformity that of the celestial bodies, the more is it imperceptible, and,
consequently, the more it is unknown, the greater is its perfection. But he who
would wish to know it and fathom it, would be terrified. To keep up perpetually
in a city, like Paris, an immense consumption, some sources of which may always
be dried up by a variety of accidents; to repress the tyranny of shop-keepers
in regard to the public, and at the same time animate their commerce; to
prevent the mutual usurpations of the one over the other, often difficult to
discriminate; to distinguish in a vast crowd all those who may easily conceal
there a hurtful industry; to purge society of them, or tolerate them only as
far as they can be useful to it by employments which no others but themselves
would undertake, or discharge so well; to keep necessary abuses within the
precise limits of necessity which they are always ready to over-leap; to
envelop them in the obscurity to which they ought to be condemned, and not even
draw them from it by chastisement too notorious; to be ignorant of what it is
better to be ignorant of than to punish, and to punish but seldom and usefully;
to penetrate by subterraneous avenues into the bosom of families, and keep for
them the secrets which they have not confided, as long as it is not necessary
to make use of them; to be present every where without being seen; in short, to
move or stop at pleasure an immense multitude, and be the soul ever-acting, and
almost unknown, of this great body: these are, in general, the functions of the
chief magistrate of the police. It should seem that one man alone could not be
equal to them, either on account of the quantity of things of which he must be
informed, or of that of the views which he must follow, or of the application
which he must exert, or of the variety of conduct which he most observe, and of
the characters which he must assume: but the public voice will answer whether
M. D'ARGENSON has been equal to them.</p>
<p>"Under him, cleanliness, tranquillity, plenty, and safety were brought to
the highest degree of perfection in this city. And, indeed, the late king
(Lewis XIV) relied entirely on his care respecting Paris. He could have given
an account of a person unknown who should have stolen into it in the dark; this
person, whatever ingenuity he exerted in concealing himself, was always under
his eye; and if, at last, any one escaped him, at least what produced almost
the same effect, no one would have dared to think himself well-concealed.</p>
<p>"Surrounded and overwhelmed in his audiences by a crowd of people chiefly of
the lower class, little informed themselves of what brought them, warmly
agitated by interests very trifling, and frequently very ill understood,
accustomed to supply the place of discourse by senseless clamour, he neither
betrayed the inattention nor the disdain which such persons or such subjects
might have occasioned."</p>
<p>"FONTENELLE has not," continues MERCIER, "spoken of the severity of M.
D'ARGENSON, of his inclination to punish, which was rather a sign of weakness
than of strength. Alas! human laws, imperfect and rude, cannot dive to the
bottom of the human heart, and there discover the causes of the delinquencies
which they have to punish! They judge only from the surface: they would acquit,
perhaps, those whom they condemn; they would strike him whom they suffer to
escape. But they cannot, I confess, do otherwise. Nevertheless, they ought to
neglect nothing that serves to disclose the heart of man. They ought to
estimate the strength of natural and indestructible passions, not in their
effects, but in their principles; to pay attention to the age, the sex, the
time, the day; these are nice rules, which could not be found in the brain of
the legislator, but which ought to be met with in that of a Minister of the
Police."</p>
<p>"There are also epidemical errors in which the multitude of those who go
astray, seems to lessen the fault; in which a sort of circumspection is
necessary, in order that punishment may not be in opposition to public
interest, because punishment would then appear absurd or barbarous, and
indignation might recoil on the law, as well as on the magistrate."</p>
<p>"What a life has a Minister of Police! He has not a moment that he can call
his own; he is every day obliged to punish; he is afraid to give way to
indulgence, because he does not know that he may not one day have to reproach
himself with it. He is under the necessity of being severe, and of acting
contrary to the inclination of his heart; not a crime is committed but he
receives the shameful or cruel account: he hears of nothing but vicious men and
vices; every instant he is told: 'there's a murder! a suicide! a rape!' Not an
accident happens but he must prescribe the remedy, and hastily; he has but a
moment to deliberate and act, and he must be equally fearful to abuse the power
intrusted to him, and not to use it opportunely. Popular rumours, flighty
conversations, theatrical factions, false alarms, every thing concerns him.</p>
<p>"Is he gone to rest? A fire rouses him from his bed. He must be answerable
for every thing; he must trace the robber, and the lurking assassin who has
committed a crime; for the magistrate appears blameable, if he has not found
means to deliver him up quickly to justice. The time that his agents have
employed in this capture will be calculated, and his honour requires that the
interval between the crime and the imprisonment should be the shortest
possible. What dreadful duties! What a laborious life! And yet this place is
coveted!</p>
<p>"On some occasions, it is necessary for the Minister of Police to demean
himself like a true <i>Greek</i>, as was the case in the following
instance:</p>
<p>"A person, being on the point of making a journey, had in his possession a
sum of twenty thousand livres which embarrassed him; he had only one servant,
whom he mistrusted, and the sum was tempting. He accordingly requested a friend
to be so obliging as to take care of it for him till his return.</p>
<p>"A fortnight after, the friend denied the circumstance. As there was no
proof, the civil law could not pronounce in this affair. Recourse was had to
the Minister of Police, who pondered a moment, and sent for the receiver,
making the accuser retire into an adjoining room:</p>
<p>"The friend arrives, and maintains that he has not received the twenty
thousand livres. "Well," said the magistrate, "I believe you; and as you are
innocent you run no, risk in writing to your wife the note that I am going to
dictate. Write."</p>
<p>"'"My dear wife, all is discovered. I shall be punished if I do not restore
you know what. Bring the sum: your coming quickly to my relief is the only way
for me to get out of trouble and obtain my pardon."</p>
<p>"'This note,' added the magistrate, 'will fully justify you. Your wife can
bring nothing since you have received nothing, and your accuser will be
foiled.'</p>
<p>"The note was dispatched; the wife, terrified, ran with the twenty thousand
livres.</p>
<p>"Thus the Minister of Police can daily make up for the imperfection and
tardiness of our civil laws; but he ought to use this rare and splendid
privilege with extreme circumspection.</p>
<p>"The chief magistrate of the police is become a minister of importance; he
has a secret and prodigious influence; he knows so many things, that he can do
much mischief or much good, because he has in hand a multitude of threads which
he can entangle or disentangle at his pleasure; he strikes or he saves; he
spreads darkness or light: his authority is as delicate as it is extensive.</p>
<p>"The Minister of Police exercises a despotic sway over the <i>mouchards</i>
who are found disobedient, or who make false reports: as for these fellows,
they are of a class so vile and so base, that the authority to which they have
sold themselves, has necessarily an absolute right over their persons.</p>
<p>"This is not the case with those who are apprehended in the name of the
police; they may have committed trifling faults: they may have enemies in that
crowd of <i>exempts</i>, spies, and satellites, who are believed on their word.
The eye of the magistrate may be incessantly deceived, and the punishment of
these crimes ought to be submitted to a more deliberate investigation; but the
house of correction ingulfs a vast number of men who there become still more
perverted, and who, on coming out, are still more wicked than when they went
in. Being degraded in their own eyes, they afterwards plunge themselves
headlong into all sorts of irregularities.</p>
<p>"These different imprisonments are sometimes rendered necessary by imperious
circumstances; yet it were always to be wished that the detention of a citizen
should not depend on a single magistrate, but that there should be a sort of
tribunal to examine when this great act of authority, withdrawn from the eye of
the law, ceases to be illegal.</p>
<p>"A few real advantages compensate for these irregular forms, and there are,
in fact, an infinite number of irregularities which the slow and grave process
of our tribunals can neither take cognizance of, nor put a stop to, nor
foresee, nor punish. The audacious or subtle delinquent would triumph in the
winding labyrinth of our civil laws. The laws of the police, more direct, watch
him, press him, and surround him mose closely. The abuse, is contiguous to the
benefit, I admit; but a great many private acts of violence, base and shameful
crimes, are repressed by this vigilant and active force which ought,
nevertheless, to publish its code and submit it to the inspection of
enlightened citizens."</p>
<p>"Could the Minister of Police communicate to the philosopher all he knows,
all he learns, all he sees, and likewise impart to him certain secret things,
of which he alone is well-informed, there would be nothing so curious and so
instructive under the pen of the philosopher; for he would astonish all his
brethren. But this magistrate is like the great penitentiary; he hears every
thing, relates nothing, and is not astonished at certain delinquencies in the
same degree as another man. By dint of seeing the tricks of roguery, the crimes
of vice, secret treachery, and all the filth of human actions, he has
necessarily a little difficulty in giving credit to the integrity and virtue of
honest people. He is in a perpetual state of mistrust; and, in the main, he
ought to possess such a character; for, he ought to think nothing impossible,
after the extraordinary lessons which he receives from men and from things. In
a word, his place commands a continual, and scrutinizing suspicion."</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p class="right"><i>February 22, in continuation.</i></p>
<p>"Even should not the Parisian have the levity with which he is reproached,
reason would justify him in its adoption. He walks surrounded by spies. No
sooner do two citizens whisper to each other, than up comes a third, who prowls
about in order to listen to what they are saying. The spies of the police are a
regiment of inquisitive fellows; with this difference, that each individual
belonging to this regiment has a distinct dress, which he changes frequently
every day; and nothing so quick or so astonishing, as these sorts of
metamorphoses.</p>
<p>"The same spy who figures as a private gentleman in the morning, in the
evening represents a priest: at one time, he is a peaceable limb of the law; at
another, a swaggering bully. The next day, with a gold-headed cane in his hand,
he will assume the deportment of a monied man buried in calculations; the most
singular disguises are quite familiar to him. In the course of the twenty-four
hours, he is an officer of distinction and a journeyman hair-dresser, a shorn
apostle and a scullion. He visits the dress-ball and the lowest sink of vice.
At one time with a diamond ring on his finger, at another with the most filthy
wig on his head, he almost changes his countenance as he does his apparel; and
more than one of these <i>mouchards</i> would teach the French <i>Roscius</i>
the art of <i>decomposing</i> himself; he is all eyes, all ears, all legs; for
he trots, I know not how, over the pavement of every quarter of the town.
Squatted sometimes in the corner of a coffee-room, you would take him for a
dull, stupid, tiresome fellow, snoring till supper is ready: he has seen and
heard all that has passed. At another time, he is an orator, and been the first
to make a bold speech; he courts you to open your mind; he interprets even your
silence, and whether you speak to him or not, he knows what you think of this
or that proceeding.</p>
<p>"Such is the universal instrument employed in Paris for diving into secrets;
and this is what determines the actions of persons in power more willingly than
any thing that could be imagined in reasoning or politics.</p>
<p>"The employment of spies has destroyed the ties of confidence and
friendship. None but frivolous questions are agitated, and the government
dictates, as it were, to citizens the subject on which they shall speak in the
evening in coffee-houses, as well as in private circles.</p>
<p>"The people have absolutely lost every idea of civil or political
administration; and if any thing could excite laughter in the midst of an
ignorance so deplorable, it would be the conversation of such a silly fellow
who constantly imagines that Paris must give the law and the <i>ton</i> to all
Europe, and thence to all the world.</p>
<p>"The men belonging to the police are a mass of corruption which the Minister
of that department divides into two parts: of the one, he makes spies or
<i>mouchards</i>; of the other, satellites, <i>exempts</i>, that is, officers,
whom he afterwards lets loose against pickpockets, swindlers, thieves, &amp;c.,
much in the same manner as a huntsman sets hounds on wolves and foxes.</p>
<p>"The spies have other spies at their heels, who watch over them, and see
that they do their duty. They all accuse each other reciprocally, and worry one
another for the vilest gain."</p>
<p>I cannot here avoid interrupting my copious but laboriously-gathered
selection from MERCIER, to relate an anecdote which shews in what a detestable
light <i>mouchards</i> are considered in Paris.</p>
<p>A man who appeared to be in tolerably good circumstances, fell in love, and
married a girl whom the death of her parents and accumulated distress had
driven to a life of dissipation. At the end of a few months, she learnt that
her husband was a spy of the police. "Probably," said, she to him, "you did not
take up this trade till after you had reflected that in following that of a
thief or a murderer, you would have risked your life." On saying this, she ran
out of the house, and precipitated herself from the <i>Pont Royal</i> into the
Seine, where she was drowned.&mdash;But to resume the observations of
MERCIER.</p>
<p>"It is from these odious dregs," continues our author, "that public order
arises.</p>
<p>"When the <i>mouchards</i> of the police have acted contrary to their
instructions, they are confined in the house of correction; but they are
separated from the other prisoners, because they would be torn to pieces by
those whom they have caused to be imprisoned, and who would recognize them.
They inspire less pity on account of the vile trade which they follow. One sees
with surprise, and with still more pain, that these fellows are very young.
Spies, informers at sixteen!&mdash;O! what a shocking life does this announce!"
exclaims MERCIER. "No; nothing ever distressed me more than to see boys act
such a part.... And those who form them into squads, who drill them, who
corrupt such inexperienced youth!"</p>
<p>Such is the admirable order which reigns in Paris, that a man suspected or
described is watched so closely, that his smallest steps are known, till the
very moment when it is expedient to apprehend him.</p>
<p>"The description taken of the man is a real portrait, which it is impossible
to mistake; and the art of thus describing the person by words, is carried to
so great a nicety, that the best writer, after much reflection on the matter,
could add nothing to it, nor make use of other expressions.</p>
<p>"The Theseuses of the police are on foot every night to purge the city of
robbers, and it might be said that the lions, bears, and tigers are chained by
political order.</p>
<p>"There are also the court-spies, the town-spies, the bed-spies, the
street-spies, the spies of impures, and the spies of wits: they are all called
by the name of <i>mouchards</i>, the family name of the first spy employed by
the court of France.</p>
<p>"Men of fashion at this day follow the trade of <i>mouchards</i>; most of
them style themselves <i>Monsieur le Baron</i>, <i>Monsieur le Comte</i>,
<i>Monsieur le Marquis</i>. There was a time, under Lewis XV, when spies were
so numerous, that it was impossible for friends, who assembled together, to
open their heart to each other concerning matters which deeply affected their
interest. The ministerial inquisition had posted its sentinels at the door of
every room, and listeners in every closet. Ingenuous confidences, made from
friends to friends, and intended to die in the very bosom where they had been
deposited, were punished as dangerous conspiracies.</p>
<p>"These odious researches poisoned social life, deprived men of pleasures the
most innocent, and transformed citizens into enemies who trembled to unbosom
themselves to each other.</p>
<p>"One fourth of the servants in Paris serve as spies; and the secrets of
families, which are thought the most concealed, come to the knowledge of those
interested in being acquainted with them.</p>
<p>"Independently of the spies of the police, ministers have spies belonging to
themselves, and keep them in pay: these are the most dangerous of all, because
they are less suspected than others, and it is more difficult to know them. By
these means, ministers know what is said of them; yet, of this they avail
themselves but little. They are more intent to ruin their enemies, and thwart
their adversaries, than to derive a prudent advantage from the free and
ingenuous hints given them by the multitude.</p>
<p>"It is entertaining enough to consider that, in proper time and place, spies
are watching him who, at his pleasure, sets spies to watch other citizens.
Thus, the links which connect mankind in political order are really
incomprehensible. He who does not admire the manner in which society exists,
and is supported by the simultaneous reaction of its members, and who sees not
the serpent's <i>tail</i> entering its <i>mouth</i>, is not born for
reflection.</p>
<p>"But the secrets of courts are not revealed through spies; they get wind by
means of certain people who are not in the least mistrusted; in like manner the
best built ships leak through an imperceptible chink, which cannot be
discovered.</p>
<p>"What is interesting in courts, and particularly so in ours," says MERCIER,
"is that there is a degree of obscurity spread over all its proceedings. We
wish to penetrate what is concealed, we endeavour to know till we learn; thus
it is that the most ingenious machine preserves its highest value only till we
have seen the springs which set it in motion.</p>
<p>"After having considered the different parts which form the police of the
capital, we still perceive all the radii reaching from the centre to the
circumference. How many ramifications issue from the same stem! How far the
branches extend! What an impulse does not Paris give to other neighbouring
cities!</p>
<p>"The police of Paris has an intimate correspondence with that of Lyons and
other provincial cities: for it is evident that it would be imperfect, if it
could not follow the disturber of public order, and if the distance of a few
leagues skreened him from researches.</p>
<p>"The correspondence of the Parisian police is not therefore limited to its
walls; it extends much farther; and it is in towns where imprudent or rash
persons would imagine that they might give their tongue greater freedom, that
the vigilant magistrate pries into conversation, and keeps a watchful eye over
those who would measure their audacity by the degree of distance from the
capital.</p>
<p><a name="let71fr3"></a>"Thus the police of Paris, after having embraced
France, penetrates also into Switzerland, Italy, Holland, and
Germany;[<a href="#let71f3">3</a>] and when occasion requires, its eye is open
on all sides to what can interest the government. When it wishes to know any
fact, it is informed of it to a certainty; when it wishes to strike a serious
blow, it seldom misses its aim.</p>
<p>"It may easily be conceived that the machine would be incomplete, and that
its play would fail in the desired effect, did it not embrace a certain extent.
It costs but little to give to the lever the necessary length. Whether the spy
be kept in pay at Paris, or a hundred leagues off, the expense is the same, and
the utility becomes greater.</p>
<p>"Experience has shewn that these observations admit of essential differences
in the branches of the police. Weights and measures must be changed, according
to time, place, persons, and circumstances. There are no fixed rules; they must
be created at the instant, and the most versatile actions are not destitute of
wisdom and reason.</p>
<p>"Of this wholesale legislators are not aware: it is reserved for
practitioners to seize these shades of distinction. There must be a customary,
and, as it were, every-day policy, in order to decide well without
precipitation, without weakness, and without rigour. What would be a serious
fault at Paris, would be a simple imprudence at Lyons, an indifferent thing
elsewhere, and so on reciprocally.</p>
<p>"Now this science has not only its details and its niceties, it has also its
variations, and sometimes even its oppositions.
<a name="let70fr4"></a>Ministers must have a steady eye and great local
experience, in order to be able to strike true, and strike opportunely, without
espousing imaginary terrors; which, in matters of police, is the greatest fault
that can be committed.[<a href="#let70f4">4</a>]
<p>"LYCURGUS, SOLON, LOCKE, and PENN! you have made very fine and majestic
laws; but would you have divined these? Although secret, they exist; they have
their wisdom, and even their depth. The distance of a few leagues gives to
matters of police two colours, which bear to each other no resemblance; and
there is no principal town which is not obliged, in modeling its police on that
of Paris, to introduce into it the greatest modifications. The motto of every
Minister of Police ought to be this: <i>The letter of the law kills, its spirit
gives life.</i></p>
<p><a name="let70fr5"></a>"The safety of Paris, during the night, is owing to
the guard[<a href="#let70f5">5</a>] and two or three hundred <i>mouchards</i>,
who trot about the streets, and recognize and follow suspected persons. It is
chiefly by night that the police makes its captions."</p>
<p>The manner in which these captions are made is humorously, gravely,
feelingly, and philosophically described by the ingenious MERCIER. Long as this
letter already is, I am confident that you will not regret its being still
lengthened by another extract or two relative to this interesting point; thus I
shall terminate the only elucidation that you are likely to obtain on a subject
which has so strongly excited your curiosity.</p>
<p>"The comic," says our lively author, "is here blended with the serious. The
fulminating order, which is going to crush you, is in the pocket of the
<i>exempt</i>, who feels a degree of pleasure in the exercise of his dreadful
functions. He enjoys a secret pride in being bearer of the thunder; he fancies
himself the eagle of Jove: but his motion is like that of a serpent. He glides
along, dodges you, crouches before you, approaches your ear, and with down-cast
eyes and a soft-toned voice, says to you, at the same time shrugging his
shoulders: '<i>Je suis au désespoir, Monsieur; mais j'ai un ordre, Monsieur,
qui vous arrête, Monsieur; de la part de la police, Monsieur</i>.'----'<i>Moi,
Monsieur</i>?'----'<i>Vous-même, Monsieur</i>.'----You waver an instant between
anger and indignation, ready to vent all sorts of imprecations. You see only a
polite, respectful, well-bred man, bowing to you, mild in his speech, and civil
in his manners. Were you the most furious of mankind, your wrath would be
instantly disarmed. Had you pistols, you would discharge them in the air, and
never against the affable <i>exempt</i>. Presently you return him his bows:
there even arises between you a contest of politeness and good breeding. It is
a reciprocity of obliging words and compliments, till the moment when the
resounding bolts separate you from the polite man, who goes to make a report of
his mission, and whose employment, by no means an unprofitable one, is to
imprison people with all possible gentleness, urbanity, and grace.</p>
<p>"I am walking quietly in the street; before me is a young man decently
dressed. All at once four fellows seize on him, collar him, push him against
the wall, and drag him away. Natural instinct commands me to go to his
assistance; a tranquil witness says to me coolly: 'Don't interfere; 'tis
nothing, sir, but a caption made by the police.' The young man is handcuffed,
and he disappears.</p>
<p>"I wish to enter a narrow street, a man belonging to the guard is posted
there as a sentinel: I perceive several of the populace looking out of the
windows. 'What's the matter, sir?' say I.----'Nothing,' replies he; 'they are
only taking up thirty girls of the town at one cast of the net.' Presently the
girls, with top-knots of all colours, file off, led by the soldiers of the
guard, who lead them gallantly by the hand, with their muskets clubbed.</p>
<p>"It is eleven o'clock at night, or five in the morning, there is a knock at
your door; your servant opens it; in a moment your room is filled with a squad
of satellites. The order is precise, resistance is vain; every thing that might
serve as a weapon is put out of your reach; and the <i>exempt</i>, who will
not, on that account, boast the less of his bravery even takes your brass
pocket-inkstand for a pistol.</p>
<p>"The next day, a neighbour, who has heard a noise in the house, asks what it
might be: 'Nothing, 'tis only a man taken up by the police.'----'What has he
done?'----'No one can tell; he has, perhaps, committed a murder, or sold a
suspicious pamphlet.'----'But, sir, there's some difference between those two
crimes.'----'May be so; but he is carried off.'</p>
<p>"You have been apprehended; but you have not been shewn the order; you have
been put into a carriage closely shut up; you know not whither you are going to
be taken; but you may be certain that you will visit the wards or dungeons of
some prison.</p>
<p>"Whence proceeds the decree of proscription? You cannot rightly guess.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary to write a thick volume against arbitrary arrests. When
one has said, <i>it is an arbitrary act</i>, one may, without any difficulty,
infer every possible consequence. But all captions are not equally unjust:
there are a multitude of secret and dangerous crimes which it would be
impossible for the ordinary course of the law to take cognizance of, to put a
stop to, and punish. When the minister is neither seduced nor deceived, when he
yields not to private passion, to blind prepossession, to misplaced severity,
his object is frequently to get rid of a disturber of the public peace; and the
police, in the manner in which the machine is set up, could not proceed, at the
present day, without this quick, active, and repressive power.</p>
<p>"It were only to be wished that there should be afterwards a particular
tribunal, which should weigh in an exact scale the motives of each caption, in
order that imprudence and guilt, the pen and the poniard, the book and the
libel, might not be confounded.</p>
<p>"The inspectors of police determine on their part a great many subaltern
captions; as they are generally believed on their word, and as they strike only
the lowest class of the people, the chief readily concedes to them the details
of this authority.</p>
<p>"Some yield to their peevishness; others, to their caprice: but who knows
whether avarice has not also a share in their proceedings, and whether they do
not often favour him who pays at the expense of him who does not pay? Thus the
liberty of the distressed and lowest citizens would have a tarif; and this
strange tax would bear hard on the very numerous portion of <i>prostitutes</i>,
<i>professed gamblers</i>, <i>quacks</i>, <i>hawkers</i>, <i>swindlers</i>, and
<i>adventurers</i>, all people who do mischief, and whom it is necessary to
punish; but who do more mischief when they are obliged to pay, and purchase,
during a certain time, the privilege of their irregularities.</p>
<p>"We have imitated from the English their Vauxhall, their Ranelagh, their
whist, their punch, their hats, their horse-races, their jockies, their
betting; but," concludes MERCIER, "when shall we copy from them something more
important, for instance, that bulwark of liberty, the law of <i>habeas
corpus</i>?"</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let71f1">Footnote 1</a>: The office of Minister of the
Police has since been abolished. M. FOUCHÉ is now a Senator, and the machine of
which he was said to be so expert a manager, is confided to the direction of
the Prefect of Police, who exercises his functions under the immediate
authority of the Ministers, and corresponds with them concerning matters which
relate to their respective departments. The higher duties of the Police are at
present vested in the <i>Grand Juge</i>, who is also Minister of Justice. The
former office is of recent creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let71fr1">Return to

of the Police, several forgeries were committed on the Bank of Vienna; Count DE

application for the delinquent to be delivered up to justice. What was his
astonishment on receiving, a few hours after, a note from M. DE SARTINE,
informing him that the author of the said forgeries had never been in Paris;
but resided in Vienna, at the same time mentioning the street, the number of
the house, and other interesting particulars!</p>
<p class="fnt">A circumstance which occurred in 1796, proves that, since the
revolution, the system of the Parisian police continues to extend to foreign
countries. The English Commissary for prisoners of war was requested by a
friend to make inquiry, on his arrival in Paris, whether a French lady of the
name of BEAUFORT was living, and in what part of France she resided. He did so;
and the following day, the card, on which he had written the lady's name, was

<h2><a name="let72">LETTER LXXII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 26, 1802.</i></p>
<p><a name="let72fr1"></a>Referring to an expression made use of in my letter
of the 16th of December last,[<a href="#let72f1">1</a>] you ask me "What the
sciences, or rather the <i>savans</i> or men of science, have done for this
people?" With the assistance of a young Professor in the <i>Collège de
France</i>, who bids fair to eclipse all his competitors, it will not be
difficult for me to answer your question.</p>
<p>Let me premise, however, that the <i>savans</i> to whom I allude, must not
be confounded with the philosophers, called <i>Encyclopædists</i>, from their
having been the first to conceive and execute the plan of the
<i>Encyclopædia</i>. These <i>savans</i> were DIDEROT, D'ALEMBERT, and
VOLTAIRE, all professed atheists, who, by the dissemination of their pernicious
doctrine, introduced into France an absolute contempt for all religion. This
infidelity, dissolving every social tie, every principle between man and man,
between the governing and the governed, in the sequel, produced anarchy,
rapine, and all their attendant horrors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the revolution, every mind being turned towards
politics, the Sciences were suddenly abandoned: they could have no weight in
the struggle which then occupied every imagination. Presently their existence
was completely forgotten. Liberty formed the subject of every writing and every
discourse: it seemed that orators alone possessed the power of serving her; and
this error was partly the cause of the calamities which afterwards overwhelmed
France. The greater part of the <i>savans</i> remained simple spectators of the
events which were preparing: not one of them openly took part against the
revolution. Some involved themselves in it. Those men were urged by great
views, and hoped to find, in the renewal of social organization, a mean of
applying and realizing their theories. They thought to master the revolution,
and were carried away by its torrent; but at that time the most sanguine hopes
were indulged. If the love of liberty be no more than a phantom of the brain,
if the wish to render men better and happier be no more than a matter of doubt,
such errors may be pardoned in those who have paid for them with their
life.</p>
<p>It is in the recollection of every one that the National Convention
consisted of two parties, which, under the same exterior, were hastening to
contrary ends: the one, composed of ignorant and ferocious men, ruled by force;
the other, more enlightened, maintained its ground by address. The former,
restless possessors of absolute power, and determined to grasp at every thing
for preserving it, strove to annihilate the talents and knowledge which made
them sensible of their humiliating inferiority. The others, holding the same
language, acted in an opposite direction. But being obliged, in order to
preserve their influence, never to shew themselves openly, they employed their
means with an extreme reserve, and this similarity at once explains the good
they did, the evil they prevented, and the calamities which they were unable to
avert.</p>
<p>At that time, France was on the very brink of ruin. <i>Landrecies</i>, <i>Le
Quesnoy</i>, <i>Condé</i> and <i>Valenciennes</i> were in the power of her
enemies. <i>Toulon</i> had been given up to the English, whose numerous fleets
held the dominion of the seas, and occasionally effected debarkations. This
country was a prey to famine and terror; <i>La Vendée</i>, <i>Lyons</i>, and
<i>Marseilles</i> were in a state of insurrection. No arms, no powder; no ally
that could or would furnish any; and its only resource lay in an anarchical
government without either plan or means of defence, and skilful only in
persecution. In a word, every thing announced that the Republic would perish,
before it could enjoy a year's existence.</p>
<p>In this extremity, two new members were called to the Committee of Public
Welfare. These two men organized the armies, conceived plans of campaign, and
prepared supplies.</p>
<p>It was necessary to arm nine hundred thousand men; and what was most
difficult, it was necessary to persuade a mistrustful people, ever ready to cry
out "treason!" of the possibility of such a prodigy. For this purpose, the old
manufactories were comparatively nothing; several of them, situated on the
frontiers, were invaded by the enemy. They were revived every where with an
activity till then unexampled. <i>Savans</i> or men of science were charged to
describe and simplify the necessary proceedings. <a name="let72fr2"></a>The
melting of the church-bells yielded all the necessary
metal.[<a href="#let72f2">2</a>] Steel was wanting; none could be obtained from
abroad, the art of making it was unknown. The <i>Savans</i> were asked to
create it; they succeeded, and this part of the public defence thus became
independent of foreign countries.</p>
<p>The exigencies of the war had rendered more glaring the urgent necessity of
having good topographical maps, and the insufficiency of those in use became
every day more evident. The geographical engineers, which corps had been
suppressed by the Constituent Assembly, were recalled to the armies, and
although they could not, in these first moments, give to their labours the
necessary extent and detail, they nevertheless paved the way to the great
results since obtained in this branch of the art military. Nothing is more easy
than to destroy; nothing is so difficult, and, above all, so tedious as to
reconstruct.</p>
<p>The persons then in power had likewise had the prudence to preserve in their
functions such pupils and engineers in the civil line as were of an age to come
under the requisition. Whatever might be the want of defenders, it was felt
that it requires ten years' study to form an engineer; while health and courage
suffice for making a soldier. This disastrous period affords instances of
foresight and skill which have not always been imitated in times more
tranquil.</p>
<p>The Sciences had just rendered great services to the country. They were
calumniated; those who had made use of them were compelled to defend them, and
did so with courage. A circumstance, equally singular and unforeseen,
occasioned complete recourse to be had to their assistance.</p>
<p>An officer arrived at the Committee of Public Welfare: he announced that the
republican armies were in presence of the enemy; but that the French generals
durst not march their soldiers to battle, because the brandies were poisoned,
and that the sick in the hospitals, having drunk some, had died. He requested
the Committee to cause them to be examined, asked for orders on this subject,
and wished to set off again immediately.</p>
<p>The most skilful chymists were instantly assembled: they were ordered to
analyze the brandies, and to indicate, in the course of the day, the poison and
the remedy.</p>
<p>These <i>savans</i> laboured without intermission, trusting only to
themselves for the most minute details. Scarcely was time allowed them to
finish their operations, when they were summoned to appear before the Committee
of Public Welfare, over which ROBESPIERRE presided.</p>
<p>They announced that the brandies were not poisoned, and that water only had
been added to them, in which was slate in suspension, so that it was sufficient
to filter them, in order to deprive them of their hurtful quality.</p>
<p>ROBESPIERRE, who hoped to discover a treason, asked the Commissioners if
they were perfectly sure of what they had just advanced. As a satisfactory
answer to the question, one of them took a strainer, poured the liquor through
it, and drank it without hesitation. All the others followed his example.
"What!" said ROBESPIERRE to him, "do you dare to drink these poisoned
brandies?"----"I durst do much more," answered he, "when I put my name to the
Report."</p>
<p>This service, though in itself of little importance, impressed the public
mind with a conception of the utility of the <i>savans</i>, a greater number of
whom were called into the Committee of Public Welfare. There they were secure
from subaltern informers, with which France abounded. Having concerns only with
the members charged with the military department, who were endeavouring to save
them, they might, by keeping silence, escape the suspicious looks of the
tyrants of the day. There was then but one resource for men of merit and
virtue, namely, to conceal their existence, and cause themselves to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>In the midst of this sanguinary persecution, all the means of defence
employed by France, issued from the obscure retreat where the genius of the
Sciences had taken refuge.</p>
<p>Powder was the article for which there was the most urgent occasion. The
soldiers were on the point of wanting it. The magazines were empty. The
administrators of the powder-mills were assembled to know what they could do.
They declared that the annual produce amounted to three millions of pounds
only, that the basis of it was saltpetre drawn from India, that extraordinary
encouragements might raise them to five millions; but that no hopes ought to be
entertained of exceeding that quantity. When the members of the Committee of
Public Welfare announced to the administrators that they must manufacture
seventeen millions of pounds of powder in the space of a few months, the latter
remained stupified. "If you succeed in doing this," said they, "you must have a
method of making powder of which we are ignorant."</p>
<p>This, however, was the only mean of saving the country. As the French were
almost excluded from the sea, it was impossible to think of procuring saltpetre
from India. The <i>savans</i> offered to extract all from the soil of the
Republic. A general requisition called to this labour the whole mass of the
people. Short and simple directions, spread with inconceivable activity, made,
of a difficult art, a common process. All the abodes of men and animals were
explored. Saltpetre was sought for even in the ruins of Lyons; and soda,
collected from among the ashes of the forests of La Vendée.</p>
<p>The results of this grand movement would have been useless, had not the
Sciences been seconded by new efforts. Native saltpetre is not fit for making
powder; it is mixed with salts and earths which render it moist, and diminish
its activity. The process employed for purifying it demanded considerable time.
The construction of powder-mills alone would have required several months, and
before that period, France might have been subjugated. Chymistry invented new
methods for refining and drying saltpetre in a few days. As a substitute for
mills, pulverized charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre were mixed, with copper
balls, in casks which were turned round by hand. By these means, powder was
made in twelve hours; and thus was verified that bold assertion of a member of
the Committee of Public Welfare: "Earth impregnated with saltpetre shall be
produced," said he, "and, in five days after, your cannon shall be loaded."</p>
<p>Circumstances were favourable for fixing, in all their perfection, the only
arts which occupied France. Persons from all the departments were sent to
Paris, in order to be instructed in the manufacture of arms and saltpetre.
Rapid courses of lectures were given on this subject. They contributed little
to the general movement, which had saved the Republic, but they had an effect
no less important, that of bringing to light the astonishing facility of the
French for acquiring the arts and sciences; a happy gift which forms one of the
finest features in the character of the nation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding so many services rendered by the Sciences, the learned were
not less persecuted; the most celebrated among them were the most exposed. The
venerable DAUBENTON, the co-operator in the labours of BUFFON, escaped
persecution only because he had written a work on the improvement of sheep, and
was taken for a simple shepherd. COUSIN was not so fortunate; yet, in his
confinement, he had the stoicism to compose works of geometry, and give lessons
of physics to his companions of misfortune.</p>
<p>LAVOISIER, that immortal character, whose generosity in promoting the
progress of science could be equalled only by his own enlightened example in
cultivating it, was also apprehended. As one of the Commissioners for fixing
the standard of weights and measures, great hopes were entertained that he
might be restored to liberty. Measures were taken with that intention; but
these were not suited to the spirit of the moment. The commission was
dissolved, and LAVOISIER left in prison. Shortly after, this ever to be
lamented <i>savant</i> was taken to the scaffold. He would still be living, had
his friends acted on the cupidity of the tyrants who then governed, instead of
appealing to their justice.</p>
<p>About this period, some members of the Convention having introduced a
discussion in favour of public instruction, it was strongly opposed by the
revolutionary party, who saw in the Sciences nothing but a poison which
enervated republics. According to them, the finest schools were the popular
societies. To do good was then impossible, and to shew an inclination to do it,
exposed to the greatest danger the small number of enlightened men France still
possessed.</p>
<p>In this point of view, every thing was done that circumstances permitted. A
military school was created, where young men from all the departments were
habituated to the exercise of arms and the life of a camp. It was called
<i>L'École de Mars</i>. Its object was not to form officers, but intelligent
soldiers, who, spread in the French armies, should soon render them the most
enlightened of Europe, as they were already the most inured to the hardships of
war.</p>
<p>Thus, a small number of men, whose conduct has been too ill appreciated,
alone retarded, by constant efforts, the progress of barbarism and struggled in
a thousand ways against the oppression which others contented themselves with
supporting.</p>
<p>At length, the bloody throne, raised by ROBESPIERRE, was overthrown: hope
succeeded to terror; and victory, to defeat. Then, the Sciences, issuing from
the focus in which they had been concentered and concealed, reappeared in all
their lustre. The services they had rendered, the dangers which had threatened
them, were felt and acknowledged. The plan of campaign, formed by the
scientific men, called to the Committee of Public Welfare, had completely
succeeded. The French armies had advanced on the rear of those of the allies,
and, threatening to cut off their retreat, not only forced them to abandon the
places they had taken, but also marched from conquest to conquest on their
territory.</p>
<p>The means of having iron, steel, saltpetre, powder, and arms, had been
created during the reign of terror. The following were the results of this
grand movement at the beginning of the third year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Twelve millions of pounds of saltpetre extracted from the soil of France in
the space of nine months. Formerly, scarcely one million was drawn from it.</p>
<p>Fifteen founderies at work for the casting of brass cannon. Their annual
produce increased to 7000 pieces. There existed in France but two
establishments of this description before the revolution.</p>
<p>Thirty founderies for iron ordnance, yielding 13,000 pieces per year. At the
breaking out of the war, there were but four, which yielded annually 900 pieces
of cannon.</p>
<p>The buildings for the manufacture of shells, shot, and all the implements of
artillery, multiplied in the same proportion.</p>
<p>Twenty new manufactories for side-arms, directed by a new process. Before
the war, there existed but one.</p>
<p>An immense manufactory of fire-arms established all at once in Paris, and
yielding 140,000 muskets per year, that is, more than all the old manufactories
together. Several establishments of this nature formed on the same plan in the
different departments of the Republic.</p>
<p>One hundred and eighty-eight workshops for repairing arms of every
description. Before the war, there existed but six.</p>
<p>The establishment of a manufactory of carbines, the making of which was till
then unknown in France.</p>
<p>The art of renewing the touch-hole of cannon discovered, and carried
immediately to a perfection which admits of its being exercised in the midst of
camps.</p>
<p>A description of the means by which tar, necessary for the navy, may be
speedily extracted from the pine-tree.</p>
<p>Balloons and telegraphs converted into machines of war.</p>
<p>All the process of the arts relative to war simplified and improved by the
application of the most learned theories.</p>
<p>A secret establishment formed at Meudon for that purpose. Experiments there
made on the oxy-muriate of potash, on fire-balls, on hollow-balls, on
ring-balls, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Great works begun for extracting from the soil of France every thing that
serves for the construction, equipment, and supplies of ships of war.</p>
<p>Several researches for replacing or reproducing the principal materials
which the exigencies of the war had consumed, and for increasing impure potash,
which the making of powder had snatched from the other manufactories.</p>
<p>Simple and luminous directions for fixing the art of making soap, and
bringing it within reach of the meanest capacity.</p>
<p>The invention of the composition of which pencils are now made in France,
the black lead for which was previously drawn from England; and what was
inappreciable in those critical circumstances, the discovery of a method for
tanning, in a few days, leather which generally required several years'
preparation.</p>
<p>In a word, if we speak of the territorial acquisitions, which were the
result of the victories obtained by means of the extraordinary resources
created by the men of science, France has acquired an extent of 1,498 square
leagues, and a population of 4,381,266 individuals; namely, Savoy, containing
411,700 inhabitants; the County of Nice, 93,166; Avignon, the <i>Comtat
Venaissin</i>, and Dutch Flanders, 200,500; Maëstricht and Venloo, 90,000;
Belgium, 1,880,000; the left bank of the Rhine, 1,658,500; Geneva and its
territory, 40,000; and Mulhausen, 7,200.</p>
<p>P.S. Paris is now all mirth and gaiety; in consequence of the revived
pleasures of the Carnival. I shall not give you my opinion of it till its
conclusion.</p>

<h2><a name="let73">LETTER LXXIII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, February 28, 1802.</i></p>
<p>In all great cities, one may naturally expect to find great vices; but in
regard to gaming, this capital presents a scene which, I will venture to
affirm, is not to be matched in any part of the world. No where is the passion,
the rage for play so prevalent, so universal: no where does it cause so much
havock and ruin. In every class of society here, gamesters abound. From men
revelling in wealth to those scarcely above beggary, every one flies to the
gaming-table; so that it follows, as a matter of course, that Paris must
contain a great number of <i>Maisons de jeu</i>, or</p>
<p class="center">PUBLIC GAMING-HOUSES.</p>
<p>They are to be met with in all parts of the town, though the head-quarters
are in the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>, or, as it is most commonly called, the
<i>Palais Royal</i>. Whenever you come to Paris, and see, on the first story, a
suite of rooms ostentatiously illuminated, and a blazing reverberator at the
door, you may be certain that it is a house of this description.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, gaming was not only tolerated in Paris, but public
gaming-houses were then licensed by the government, under the agreeable name of
<i>Académies de jeu</i>. There, any one might ruin himself under the immediate
superintendance of the police, an officer belonging to which was always
present. Besides these academies, women of fashion and impures of the first
class were allowed to keep a gaming-table or <i>tripot de jeu</i>, as it was
termed, in their own house. This was a privilege granted to them in order that
they might thereby recover their shattered fortune. When all the necessary
expenses were paid, these ladies commonly shared the profits with their
protectors, that is, with their friends in power, through whose protection the
<i>tripot</i> was sanctioned. Every one has heard of the fatal propensity to
gaming indulged in by the unfortunate Marie Antoinette. The French women of
quality followed her pernicious example, as the young male nobility did that of
the Count d'Artois and the Duke of Orleans; so that, however decided might be
the personal aversion of Lewis XVI to gaming, it never was more in fashion at
the court of France than during his reign. This is a fact, which can be
confirmed by General S---th and other Englishmen who have played deep at the
queen's parties.</p>
<p>At the present day, play is, as I have before stated, much recurred to as a
financial resource, by many of the <i>ci-devant</i> female <i>noblesse</i> in
Paris. In their parties, <i>bouillotte</i> is the prevailing game; and the
speculation is productive, if the company will sit and play. Consequently, the
longer the sitting, the greater the profits. The same lady who moralizes in the
morning, and will read you a lecture on the mischievous consequences of gaming,
makes not the smallest hesitation to press you to sit down at her
<i>bouillotte</i> in the evening, where she knows you will almost infallibly be
a loser. No protection, I believe, is now necessary for a lady who chooses to
have a little private gaming at her residence, under the specious names of
<i>société</i>, <i>bal</i>, <i>thé</i>, or <i>concert</i>. But this is not the
case with the <i>Maisons de jeu</i>, where the gaming-tables are public; or
even with private houses, where the object of the speculation is publicly
known. These purchase a license in the following manner. A person, who is said
to have several <i>sleeping</i> partners, engages to pay to the government the
sum of 3,600,000 francs (<i>circa</i> £150,000 sterling) a year for the power
of licensing all gaming-houses in this capital, and also to account for a tenth
part of the profits, which enter the coffer of the minister at the head of the
department of the police. This contribution serves to defray part of the
expense of greasing the wheels of that intricate machine. Without such a
license, no gaming-house can be opened in Paris. Sometimes it is paid for by a
share in the profits, sometimes by a certain sum per sitting.</p>
<p>These <i>Maisons de jeu</i>, where dupes are pitted against cheats, are
filled from morning to night with those restless beings, who, in their eager
pursuit after fortune, almost all meet with disappointment, wretchedness, ruin,
and every mischief produced by gaming. This vice, however, carries with it its
own punishment; but it is unconquerable in the heart which it ravages. It lays
a man prostrate before those fantastic idols, distinguished by the synonymous
names of fate, chance, and destiny. It banishes from his mind the idea of
enriching himself, or acquiring a competence by slow and industrious means. It
feeds, it inflames his cupidity, and deceives him in order to abandon him
afterwards to remorse and despair.</p>
<p>From the mere impulse of curiosity, I have been led to visit some of the
principal <i>Maisons de jeu</i>. I shall therefore represent what I have
seen.</p>
<p>In a spacious suite of apartments, where different games of chance are
played, is a table of almost immeasurable length, covered with a green cloth,
with a red piece at one end, and a black, one at the other. It is surrounded by
a crowd of persons of both sexes, squeezed together, who, all suspended between
fear and hope, are waiting, with eager eyes and open mouth, for the favourable
or luckless chance. I will suppose that the banker or person who deals the
cards, announces "<i>rouge perd, couleur gagne</i>." The oracle has spoken. At
these words of fate, on one side of the table, you see countenances smiling,
but with a smile of inquietude, and on the other, long faces, on which is
imprinted the palid hue of death. However, the losers recover from their
stupor: they hope that the next chance will be more fortunate. If that happens,
and the banker calls out "<i>rouge gagne, couleur perd</i>;" then the scene
changes, and the same persons whom you have just seen so gay, make a sudden
transition from joy to sadness, and <i>vice versa</i>. This contrast no
language can paint, and you must see it, in order to conceive how the most
headstrong gamblers can spend hour after hour in such a continual state of
agitation, in which they are alternately overwhelmed by rage, anguish, and
despair. Some are seen plucking out their hair by the roots, scratching their
face, and tearing their clothes to pieces, when, after having lost considerable
sums, frequently they have not enough left to pay for a breakfast or dinner.
What an instructive lesaon for the novice! What a subject of reflection for the
philosophic spectator! At these scenes of folly and rapacity it is that the
demon of suicide exults in the triumphs he is on the point of gaining over the
weakness, avarice, and false pride of mortals. If the wretched victim has not
recourse to a pistol, he probably seeks a grave at the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Among these professed gamblers, it often happens that some of them, in order
to create what they term <i>resources</i>, imagine tricks and impostures
scarcely credible. I shall relate an anecdote which I picked up in the course
of my inquiries respecting the garning-houses in Paris. It may be necessary to
premise that the counterfeit louis, which are in circulation in this country,
and have nearly the appearance of the real coin, are employed by these knaves;
they commonly produce them at night, because they then run less risk of being
detected in passing them; but these means are very common and almost out of
date.</p>
<p>In the great gaming-houses in Paris, it is customary to have on the table
several <i>rouleaux</i> of louis d'or. An old, experienced gambler came one day
to a house of this class, with his pockets full of leaden <i>rouleaux</i> of
the exact form and size of those containing fifty louis d'or. He placed at one
of the ends of the table (either black or red) one of his leaden
<i>rouleaux</i>: he lost. The master of the bank took up his <i>rouleau</i>,
and, without opening it, put it with the good <i>rouleaux</i> in the middle of
the table, where the bank is kept. The old gambler, without being disconcerted,
staked another. He won, and withdrew the good <i>rouleau</i> given him, leaving
the counterfeit one on the table, at the same time calling out, "I stake ten
louis out of the <i>rouleau</i>." The cards were drawn; he won: the banker, to
pay him the ten louis, took a <i>rouleau</i> from the bank. Chance willed that
he lighted on the leaden <i>rouleau</i>. He endeavoured to break it open by
striking it on the table: the <i>rouleau</i> withstood his efforts. The
gambler, without deranging his features, then said to the banker; "Mind you
don't break it." The banker, disconcerted, tore the paper, and, on opening it,
found it to contain nothing but lead. There being no positive proof against the
gambler, he was permitted to retire, and his only punishment was to be in
future excluded from this gaming-house. But he had the consolation of knowing
that ninety-nine others would be open to him. However, this and other
impostures have led to a regulation, that, in all these houses, the value of
every stake should be apparent to the eye, and openly exposed on the table.</p>
<p>From what I have said you might infer that <i>trente-et-un</i> (or <i>rouge
et noir</i>) is the most fashionable game played here; but, though this is the
case, it is not the only one in high vogue. Many others, equally pernicious,
are pursued at the same time, such as <i>la roulette</i>, <i>passe-dix</i>, and
<i>biribi</i>, at which cheats and sharpers can, more at their ease, execute
their feats of dexterity and schemes of plunder. Women frequent the
gaming-tables as well as the men, and often pledge their last shift to make up
a stake. It is shocking to contemplate a young female gamester, the natural
beauty of whose countenance is distorted into deformity by a succession of
agonizing passions. Yet so distressing an object is no uncommon thing in
Paris.</p>
<p>You may, perhaps, be curious to know what are these games, of
<i>trente-et-un</i>, <i>biribi</i>, <i>passe-dix,</i> and <i>la roulette</i>.
Never having played at any of them, such a description as I might pretend to
give, could at best be but imperfect. For which, reason I shall not engage in
the attempt.</p>
<p><a name="let73fr1"></a>It is confidently affirmed that in the principal
towns of France, namely, Bordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, Rouen, &amp;c. the rage
for play is no less prevalent than in the capital, where gaming-houses daily
increase in number.[<a href="#let73f1">1</a>] They are now established in every
quarter in Paris, even the poorest, and there are some where the lowest of the
populace can indulge in a <i>penchant</i> for gaming, as the stake is
proportioned to their means. This is the ruin of every class of inhabitants and
of foreigners; so much so, that suicides here increase in exact proportion to
the increase of gaming-houses.</p>
<p>Is it not astonishing that the government should suffer, still more promote
the existence of an evil so pernicious in every point of view? From the present
state of the French finances, it would, notwithstanding, appear that every
consideration, however powerful, must yield to the want of money required for
defraying the expenses of the department of the Police.</p>
<p><i>Minima de malis</i> was the excuse of the old government of France for
promoting gaming. "From the crowd of dissipated characters of every
description, accumulated in great cities," said its partisans, "governments
find themselves compelled to tolerate certain abuses, in order to avoid evils
of greater magnitude. They are forced to compound with the passions which they
are unable to destroy; and it is better that men should be professed gamblers
than usurers, swindlers, and thieves." Such was the reasoning employed in
behalf of the establishment of the <i>Académies de jeu</i>, which existed prior
to the revolution. Such is the reasoning reproduced, at the present day, in
favour of the <i>Maisons de jeu</i>; but, when I reflect on all the horrors
occasioned by gaming, I most ardently wish that every argument in favour of so
destructive a vice, may be combated by a pen like that of Rousseau, which, Sir
William Jones says, "had the property of spreading light before it on the
darkest objects, as if he had written with phosphorus on the walls of a
cavern."</p>
<p class="fnt"><a name="let73f1">Footnote 1</a>: During the Carnival of the
present year (1803) the masked balls at the grand French Opera were quite
deserted, in consequence of a new gaming-house, established solely for
foreigners, having, by the payment of considerable sums to the government,
obtained permission to give masked balls. These balls were all the rage. There
was one every Tuesday, and the employment of the whole week was to procure
cards of invitation; for persons were admitted by <i>invitation</i> only, no
money being taken. The rooms, though spacious, were warm and comfortable; the
company, tolerably good, and extremely numerous, but chiefly composed of
foreigners. <i>Treute-et-un</i>, <i>biribi</i>, <i>pharaon</i>, <i>creps</i>,
and other fashionable games were played, so that the <i>speculators</i> could
very well afford to give all sorts of refreshments, and an elegant supper
<i>gratis</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let73fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let74">LETTER LXXIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 1, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the institutions subsisting here before the revolution, that which
has experienced the greatest enlargement is the</p>
<p class="center">MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.</p>
<p>This establishment, formerly called <i>Le Jardin du Roi</i>, and now more
commonly known by the name of <i>Le Jardin des Plantes</i>, received its
present denomination by a decree of the National Convention, dated the 10th of
June 1793. It is situated on the south bank of the Seine, nearly facing the
Arsenal, and consists of a botanical garden, a collection of natural history, a
library of works relating to that science, an amphitheatre for the lectures,
and a <i>ménagerie</i> of living animals.</p>
<p>Originally, it was nothing more than a garden for medicinal plants, formed
under that title, in 1626, by GUY DE LA BROSSE, principal physician to Lewis
XIII, who sanctioned the establishment by letters patent. The king's physicians
were almost always intendants of this garden till the year 1739, when it was
placed under the direction of BUFFON. Before his time, the cabinet was
trifling. It consisted only of some curiosities collected by GEOFFROY, and a
few shells which had belonged to TOURNEFORT; but, through the zeal of BUFFON,
and the care of his co-operator DAUBENTON, it became a general <i>dépôt</i> of
natural history, and its riches had increased still more than its utility. On
the breaking out of the revolution, it had been protected through that sort of
respect which the rudest men have for the productions of nature, whence they
either receive or expect relief for their sufferings. It had even been
constantly defended by the revolutionary administration, under whose control
and dependence it was placed. Regarding it, in some measure, as their private
property, their pride was interested in its preservation; and had any attempt
been made to injure it, they would infallibly have caused an insurrection among
the inhabitants of the surrounding <i>faubourg</i>. These singular
circumstances, joined to the good understanding prevailing among the
professors, had maintained this fine establishment in a state, if not
increasing, at least stationary. On the revival of order, ideas were
entertained of giving to it an extension which had already been projected and
decreed, even during the reign of terror.</p>
<p>The botanical garden was enlarged; the extent of the ground intended for the
establishment was doubled; a <i>ménagerie</i> was formed; new hot-houses and
new galleries were constructed; the addition of new professors was confirmed,
and all the necessary disbursements were made with magnificence. Thus, in the
same place where every production of nature was assembled, natural history was
for the first time taught in its aggregate; and these courses of lectures,
become celebrated by the brilliancy of the facts illustrated in them, the
number of pupils who frequent them, and the great works of which they have been
the cause or the motive, have rendered the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY one of the
first establishments of instruction existing in Europe.</p>
<p>Formerly, there were but three professors attached to this establishment. At
present, there are no less than thirteen, who each give a course of forty
lectures. The courses of zoology and mineralogy take place in the halls of the
cabinet containing the collections corresponding to each of those sciences. The
courses of botany, anatomy, and chemistry are delivered in the great
amphitheatre, and that of natural iconography in the library. The days and
hours of the lectures are announced every year by particular
advertisements.</p>
<p>The establishment is administered, under the authority of the Minister of
the Interior, by the professors, who choose, annually, from among themselves, a
director. At present, that situation is held by FOURCROY. Although this
celebrated professor, in his lectures on chemistry, must principally attach
himself to minerals, the particular object of chemical inquiry, he is far from
neglecting vegetable and animal substances, the analysis of which will, in
time, spread great light on organic bodies. The most recent discoveries on the
exact constitution of bodies are made known in the course of these lectures,
and a series of experiments, calculated for elucidating the demonstrations,
takes place under the eyes of the auditors.</p>
<p>No one possesses more than FOURCROY the rare talent of classing well his
subjects, of presenting facts in a striking point of view, and of connecting
them by a succession of ideas extremely rapid, and expressed in a voice whose
melody gives an additional charm to eloquence. The pleasure of hearing him is
peculiarly gratifying; and, indeed, when he delivers a lecture, the
amphitheatre, spacious as it is, is much too small to contain the crowd of
auditors. Then, the young pupils are seen with their eyes stedfastly fixed on
their master, catching his word with avidity, and fearing to lose one of them;
thus paying by their attention the most flattering tribute to the astonishing
facility of this orator of science, from whose lips naturally flow, as from a
spring, the most just and most select expressions. Frequently too, carried away
by the torrent of his eloquence, they forget what they have just heard, to
think only of what he is saying. FOURCROY speaks in this manner for upwards of
two hours, without any interruption, and, what is more, without tiring either
his auditors or himself. He writes with no less facility than he speaks. This
is proved by the great number of works which he has published. But in his
writings, his style is more calm, more smooth than that of his lectures.</p>
<p>Each professor superintends and arranges the part of the collections
corresponding to the science which he is charged to teach. For this purpose,
there are also assistant naturalists, whose employment is to prepare the
various articles of natural history. The keeper of the cabinet, under the
authority of the director, takes all the measures necessary for the
preservation of the collections. The principal ones are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The cabinet of natural history, containing the animal kingdom, divided into
its classes; the mineral kingdom; the fossils, woods, fruits, and other
vegetable productions, together with the herbals. This cabinet, which occupies
the buildings on the right, on entering from the street, is open to students on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, from eleven o'clock till two, and to the
public in general every Tuesday and Friday in the afternoon.</li>
<li>The library, chiefly composed of works relating to natural history,
contains, among other valuable articles, an immense collection of animals and
plants, painted on vellum. Three painters are charged to continue this
collection under the superintendance of the professors. The library is open to
the public every day from eleven o'clock to two.</li>
<li>The cabinet of anatomy, containing the preparations relative to the human
race and to animals. It is situated in a separate building, and for the present
open to students only.</li>
<li>The botanical school, containing the plants growing in the open ground, and
the numerous hot-houses in which are cultivated those peculiar to warm
countries.</li>
<li>The <i>ménagerie</i> of foreign animals. At the present moment, they are
dispersed in various parts of the garden; but they are shortly to be assembled
in a spacious and agreeable place.</li>
<li>The chemical laboratory and the collection of chemical productions.</li>
</ol>
<p>To these may be added a laboratory for the preparation of objects of natural
history, and another for that of objects of anatomy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the improved state to which BUFFON had brought this
establishment, yet, through the united care of the several scientific men who
have since had the direction of it, the constant attention bestowed on it by
the government, and even by the conquests of the French armies, its riches have
been so much increased, that its collection of natural history may at this day
be considered as the finest in being. The department of the minerals and that
of the quadrupeds are nearly complete; that of the birds is one of the most
considerable and the handsomest known; and the other classes, without answering
yet the idea which a naturalist might conceive of thenm, are, nevertheless,
superior to what other countries have to offer.</p>
<p>Among the curious or scarce articles in this Museum, the following claim
particular notice:</p>
<p>In the class of quadrupeds, adult individuals, stuffed, such as the
camelopard, the hippopotamus, the single-horned rhinoceros, the Madagascar
squirrel, the Senegal lemur, two varieties of the oran-outang, the
proboscis-monkey, different specimens of the indri, some new species of bats
and opossums, the Batavian kangaroo, and several antelopes, ant-eaters,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>In the class of birds, a great number of new or rare species, and among
those remarkable either for size or beauty, are the golden vulture, the great
American eagle, the Impey peacock, the Ju[*blot*] pheasant or argus, the
plantain-eater, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Among the reptiles, the crocodile of the Ganges, the fimbriated tortoise of
Cayenne, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Among the shells, the glass patella, and a number of valuable, scarce, or
new species.</p>
<p>The collection of insects has just been completed through the assiduity of
the estimable LAMARCK, the professor who has charge of that department.</p>
<p>In the mineral kingdom, independently of the numerous and select choice of
all the specimens, are to be remarked as objects of particular curiosity, the
petrifactions of crocodiles' bones found in the mountain of St. Pierre at
Maëstricht, and the collection of impressions of fishes from Mount Bolca, near
Verona.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the <i>ménagerie</i> contains a female elephant only,
the male having died since my arrival in Paris, three dromedaries, two camels,
five lions, male and female, a white bear, a brown bear, a mangousta, a civet,
an alligator, an ostrich, and several other scarce and curious animals, the
number and variety of which receive frequent additions. In other parts of the
garden are inclosures for land and sea fowls, as well as ponds for fishes.</p>
<p>The denomination of <i>Jardin des Plantes</i> is very appropriate to this
garden, as it furnishes to all the botanical establishments throughout France
seeds of trees and plants useful to the p[*blot*]ess of agriculture and of the
arts; and hence the indigent poor are supplied with such medicinal plants as
are proper for the cure or relief of their complaints.</p>
<h2><a name="let75">LETTER LXXV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 3, 1802.</i></p>
<p>It has been repeatedly observed that civilized nations adhere to their
ancient customs for no other reason than because they are ancient. The French
have, above all, a most decided partiality for those which afford them
opportunities of amusement. It must therefore have been a subject of no small
regret to them, on the annual return of those periods, to find the government
taking every measure for the suppression of old habits. For some years since
the revolution, all disguises and masquerades were strictly prohibited; but,
though the executive power forbade pasteboard masks, its authority could not
extend to those mental disguises which have been occasionally worn by many
leading political characters in this country. No sooner was the prohibition
against masquerading removed, than the Parisians gave full scope to the
indulgence of their inclination; and this year was revived, in all its glory,
the celebration of</p>
<p class="center">THE CARNIVAL.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the conclusion of that mirthful period, during which Folly
seemed to have taken possession of all the inhabitants of this populous city.
Every thing that gaiety, whim, humour, and eccentricity could invent, was put
in practice to render it a sort of continued jubilee. From morn to night, the
concourse of masks of every description was great beyond any former example;
but still greater was the concourse of spectators. All the principal streets
and public gardens were thronged by singular characters, in appropriate
dresses, moving about in small detached parties or in numerous close bodies, on
foot, on horseback, or in carriages. The <i>Boulevards</i>, the <i>Rue de la
Loi</i>, and the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i>, exhibited long processions of masks and
grotesque figures, crowded both in the inside and on the outside of vehicles of
all sorts, from a <i>fiacre</i> to a German waggon, drawn by two, four, six,
and eight horses; while the <i>Palais Royal</i>, the <i>Tuileries</i>, the
<i>Place de la Concorde</i>, and the <i>Champs Elysées</i> were filled with
pedestrian wits, amusing the surrounding multitude by the liveliness of their
sallies and the smartness of their repartee. Here S[*blot*]pins, Scaramouches,
Punchinellos, Pierrots, Harlequins, and Columbines, together with nuns, friars,
abbés, bishops, and <i>marquis</i> in caricature, enlivened the scene: there,
sultans, sultanas, janissaries, mamlûks, Turks, Spaniards, and Indians, in
stately pride, attracted attention. On one side, a Mars and Venus, an Apollo
and Daphne, figured under the attributes of heathen mythology: on another, more
than one Adam and Eve recalled to mind the origin of the creation.</p>
<p>To the eye of an untravelled Englishman, the novelty of this sight must have
been a source of no small entertainment. If he was of a reflecting mind,
however, it must have given rise to a variety of observations, and some of them
of a rather serious nature. In admiring the order and decency which reigned
amidst so much mirth and humour, he must have been desirous to appreciate the
influence of political events on the character of this people. In a word, he
must have been anxious to ascertain how far the return of our Gallic neighbours
to their ancient habits, announces a return to their ancient institutions.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Carnival of modern times is an imitation of the
Saturnalia of the ancients, and that the celebration of those festivals was
remarkable for the liberty which universally prevailed; slaves being, at that
period, permitted to ridicule their masters, and speak with freedom on every
subject. During the last years of the French monarchy, the Parisians neglected
not to avail themselves of this privilege. When all classes were confounded, at
the time of the Carnival, the most elevated became exposed to the lash of the
lowest; and, under the mask of satire, the abuses which had crept into
religious societies, and the corruption which prevailed in every department of
the State, escaped not their bold censure. From a consciousness, no doubt, of
their own weakness, the different governments that have ruled over France since
the revolution, dreaded the renewal of scenes in which their tottering
authority might be overthrown; but such an apprehension cannot have been
entertained by the present government, as manifestly appears from the almost
unlimited license which has reigned during the late Carnival. Notwithstanding
which, it is worthy of remark that no satirical disguises were met with, no
shafts of ridicule were aimed at the constituted authorities, no invective was
uttered against such and such an opinion, no abuse was levelled against this or
that party. Censure and malice either slept or durst not shew themselves,
though freedom of expression seemed to be under no restraint.</p>
<p>Formerly, when the people appeared indifferent to the motley amusements of
the Carnival, and little disposed to mix in them, either as actors or
spectators, it was not uncommon for the government to pay for some
masquerading. The <i>mouchards</i> and underlings of the police were habited as
grotesque characters, calculated to excite curiosity, and promote mirth. They
then spread themselves, to the number of two or three thousand, over different
parts of the town, and gave to the streets of Paris a false colouring of joy
and gladness; for the greater the misery of the people, the more was it thought
necessary to exhibit an outward representation of public felicity. But these
political impostures, having been seen through, at length failed in their
effect, and were nearly relinquished before the revolution. At that time,
nothing diverted the populace so much as <i>attrapes</i> or bites; and every
thing that engendered gross and filthy ideas was sure to please. Pieces of
money, heated purposely, were scattered on the pavement, in order that persons,
who attempted to pick them up, might burn their fingers. Every sort of bite was
practised; but the greatest attraction and acme of delight consisted of
<i>chianlits</i>, that is, persons masked, walking about, apparently, in their
shirt, the tail of which was besmeared with mustard.</p>
<p>At the present day, these coarse and disgusting jokes are evidently laid
aside, as some of a more rational kind are exhibited; such as the nun, partly
concealed in a truss of straw, and strapped on the catering friar's back; the
effect of the galvanic fluid; and many others too numerous to mention. No
factitious mirth was this year displayed; it was all natural; and if it did not
add to the small sum of happiness of the distressed part of the Parisian
community, it must, for a while at least, have made them forget their
wretchedness. With few exceptions, every one seemed employed in laughing or in
exciting laughter. Many of the characters assumed were such as afforded an
opportunity of displaying a particular species of wit or humour; but the dress
of some of the masquerading parties, being an excellent imitation of the rich
costumes of Asia, must have been extremely expensive.</p>
<p>To conclude, the masked balls at the Opera, on the last days of the
Carnival, were numerously attended. Very few characters were here attempted,
and those were but faintly supported. Adventures are the principal object of
the frequenters of these balls, and I have reason to think that the persons who
went in quest of them were not disappointed. In short, though I have often
passed the Carnival in Paris, I never witnessed one that went off with greater
<i>éclat</i>. As the Turkish Spy observes, a small quantity of ashes, dropped,
the day after its conclusion, on the head of these people in disguise, cools
their frenzy. From being mad and foolish, they become calm and rational.</p>
<h2><a name="let76">LETTER LXXVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 5, 1802.</i></p>
<p>As I foresee that my private affairs will, probably, require my presence in
England sooner than I expected, I hasten to give you an idea of the principal
public edifices which I have not, yet noticed. One of these is the
<i>Luxembourg</i> Palace, now called the</p>
<p class="center">PALAIS DU SÉNAT CONSERVATEUR.</p>
<p>Mary of Medicis, relict of Henry IV, having purchased of the Duke of
Luxembourg his hotel and its dependencies, erected on their site this palace.
It was built in 1616, under the direction of JACQUES DE BROSSE, on the plan of
the <i>Pitti</i> palace at Florence.</p>
<p>Next to the <i>Louvre</i>, the <i>Luxembourg</i> is the most spacious palace
in Paris. It is particularly distinguished for its bold character, its
regularity, and the beauty of its proportions. The whole façade is ornamented
with coupled pilasters: on the ground-floor, the Tuscan order is employed, and
above, the Doric, with alternate rustics. In the four pavilions, placed at the
angles of the principal pile, the Ionic has been added to the other two orders,
because they are more elevated than the rest of the buildings. Towards the
<i>Rue de Tournon</i>, the two pavilions communicate by a handsome terrace, in
the middle of which is a circular saloon, surmounted by a dome of the most
elegant proportion. Beneath this dome is the principal entrance. The court is
spacious, and on each side of it are covered arches which form galleries on the
ground-floor and in front of the upper story.</p>
<p>The twenty-four pictures which Mary of Medicis had caused to be painted by
the celebrated RUBENS, for the gallery of the <i>Luxembourg</i>, had been
removed from it some years before the revolution. At that time even, they were
intended for enriching the Museum of the <i>Louvre</i>. Four of them are now
exhibited there in the Great Gallery. They are allegorical; with the other
twenty, they represent the prosperous part of the history of that queen, and
form a striking contrast to the adversity she afterwards experienced through
the persecution of Cardinal Richelieu.</p>
<p>To gratify his revenge, he ordered all the furniture, &amp;c. belonging to
Mary of Medicis to be sold, together with the statues which then decorated the
courts and garden of the <i>Luxembourg</i>, and pursued with inveteracy the
unfortunate queen who had erected this magnificent edifice. Being exiled from
France in 1631, she wandered for a long time in Flanders, and also in England,
till the implacable cardinal prevailed on Charles I, to command her to quit the
kingdom. In 1642, she took refuge at Cologne, and, at the age of 68, there died
in a garret, almost through hunger and distress.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, this palace belonged to MONSIEUR, next brother to
Lewis XVI. It has since been occupied by the Directory, each of whose members
here had apartments. No material change has yet been made in it; nor does any
thing announce that the partial alterations intended, either in its exterior or
interior, will speedily be completed.</p>
<p class="bq">"----<i>Pendent opera interrupta minæque, &amp;c.</i>"</p>
<p>At the present day, the <i>Luxembourg</i> is appropriated to the
Conservative Senate, whose name it has taken, and who here hold their sittings
in a hall, fitted up in a style of magnificence still superior to that of the
Legislative Body. But the sittings of the former are not public like those of
the latter; and as I had no more than a peep at their fine hall, I cannot enter
into a description of its beauties.</p>
<p>However, I took a view of their garden, in which I had formerly passed many
a pleasant hour. Here, workmen are employed in making considerable
improvements. It was before very irregular, particularly towards the south,
where the view from the palace was partly concealed by the buildings of the
monastery of the Carthusians. By degrees, these irregularities are made to
disappear, and this garden will shortly be laid out in such a manner as to
correspond better with the majesty of the palace, and display its architecture
to greater advantage. Alleys of trees, which were decayed from age, have been
cut down, and replaced by young plants of thriving growth. In front of the
south façade is to be a tasteful parterre, with an oblong piece of water in its
centre. Beyond the garden is a large piece of ground formerly belonging to the
Carthusian monastery, which is now nearly demolished; this ground is to be
converted into a national nursery for all sorts of valuable fruit-trees. Being
contiguous to the garden of the Senate, with which it communicates, it will
furnish a very extensive promenade, and consequently add to the agreeableness
of the place.</p>
<p>The present Minister of the Interior, CHAPTAL, who cultivates the arts and
sciences with no less zeal than success, purposes to make here essays on the
culture of vine-plants of every species, in order to obtain comparative
results, which will throw a new light on that branch of rural economy.</p>
<p>A great number of vases and statues are placed in the garden of the Senate.
Many of these works are indifferently executed, though a few of them are in a
good style. Certainly, a more judicious and more decorous choice ought to have
been made. It was not necessary to excite regret in the mind of the moralist,
by placing under the eyes of the public figures of both sexes which are
repugnant to modesty. If it be really meant to attempt to mend the loose morals
of the nation, why are nudities, which may be considered as the leaven of
corruption, exposed thus in this and other national gardens in Paris?</p>

<p>St. Foix, in his "<i>Essais historiques sur Paris</i>" speaking of the
Bastille, says, "it is a castle, which, without being strong, is one of the
most formidable in Europe." In their arduous struggle for liberty, the French
have scarcely left a vestige of this dread abode, in which have been immured so
many victims of political vengeance. I will not pretend to affirm that such is
the description of prisoners now confined in</p>
<p class="center">LE TEMPLE.</p>
<p>But when the liberty of individuals lies at the mercy of arbitrary power,
every one has a right to draw his own inference.</p>
<p>This edifice takes its name from the Templars, whose chief residence it was
till they were annihilated in 1313. Philip the Fair and Clement V contrived,
under various absurd pretences, to massacre and burn the greater part of the
knights of this order. The knights of St. John of Jerusalem were put in
possession of all the property of the Templars, except such part as the king of
France and the Pope thought fit to share between them. The <i>Temple</i> then
became the provincial house of the Grand Priory of France.</p>
<p>The Grand Priory consisted of the inclosure within the walls of the
<i>Temple</i>, where stood a palace for the Grand Prior, a church, and several
houses inhabited by shopkeepers and mechanics; but, with the considerable
domains annexed to it, this post, before the revolution, yielded to the eldest
son of the Count d'Artois, as Grand Prior, an annual revenue of 200,000 livres.
The inclosure was at that time a place of refuge for debtors, where they
enjoyed the privilege of freedom from arrest.</p>
<p>The palace was erected by JACQUES SOUVRÉ, Grand Prior of France. Near it, is
a large Gothic tower of a square form, flanked by four round turrets of great
elevation, built by HUBERT, treasurer to the Templars, who died in 1222.</p>
<p>It was in this building, which was considered as one of the most solid in
France, that Lewis XVI was confined from the middle of September 1792 to the
day of his execution. From the 13th of August till that period, the royal
family had occupied the part of the palace which has been preserved. This
tower, when it had been entirely insulated and surrounded by a ditch, was
inclosed by a high wall, which also included part of the garden. The casements
were provided with strong iron bars, and masked by those shutters, called, I
believe, <i>trunk-lights</i>. As for the life which the unhappy monarch led in
this prison, a detailed narrative of it has been published in England, by
Cléry, his faithful <i>valet-de-chambre</i>.</p>
<p>I have not been very anxious to approach the <i>Temple</i>, because I
concluded that, if fame was not a liar, there was no probability of my having
an opportunity of seeing any part of it, except the outer wall. The result was
a confirmation of my opinion. Who are its occupiers? What is their number? What
are their crimes? These are questions which naturally intrude themselves on the
mind, when one surveys the turrets of this new Bastille&mdash;for, whether a
place of confinement for state-prisoners be called <i>La Bastille</i> or <i>Le
Temple</i>, nevertheless it is a state-prison, and reminds one of slavery,
which, as Sterne says, is, in any disguise, a bitter draught; and though
thousands, in all ages, have been made to drink of it, still it is not, on that
account, less bitter.</p>
<h2><a name="let77">LETTER LXXVII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 8, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be always able to answer your
inquiries without hesitation. Considering the round of amusements in which I
live, I flatter myself you will readily admit that it requires no small share
of good-will and perseverance to devote so much time to scribbling for your
entertainment. As for information, you will, on your arrival in Paris, know how
much or how little you have derived from the perusal of my letters. You will
then have it in your power to compare and judge. With the originals before you,
you cannot be at a loss to determine how far the sketches resemble them.</p>
<p>Some of your inquiries have been already answered in my former letters.
Among the number, however, you will find no reply on the subject of the</p>
<p class="center">PRESENT STATE OF THE FRENCH PRESS.</p>
<p>This question being of a nature no less delicate than that concerning the
police, you cannot but commend my discretion in adopting a similar method to
gratify your curiosity; that is, to refer you to the intelligent author whom I
quoted on the former occasion. If common report speaks the truth&mdash;<i>Sit
mihi fas audita loqui?</i>&mdash;the press here is now in much the same state
in which it was before the revolution. I shall therefore borrow again the
language of MERCIER, who is a famous dreamer, inasmuch as many of his dreams
have been realized: yet, with all his foresight and penetration, I question
whether he ever dreamt that his picture of the French press, drawn in the
interval between the years 1781 and 1788, would still be, in some respects, a
true one at the beginning of the year 1802. But, as Boileau shrewdly
remarks,</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Le vrai peut quelquefois n'être pas vraisemblable.</i>"</p>
<p>"The enemies of books," says our author, "are the enemies of, knowledge, and
consequently of mankind. The shackles with which the press is loaded, are an
incitement for setting them at defiance. If we were to enjoy a decent liberty,
we should no longer have recourse to licentiousness. There are political evils
which the liberty of the press prevents, and this is already a great benefit.
The interior police of States requires to be enlightened by disinterested
writings. There is no one but the philosopher, satisfied with the esteem alone
of his fellow-citizens, that can raise himself above the clouds formed by
personal interest, and set forth the abuses of insidious custom. In short, the
liberty of the press will always be the measure of civil liberty; and it is a
species of thermometer, which shews, at one glance, what a people have lost or
gained.</p>
<p>"If we adopt this maxim, we are every day losing; for every day the press is
more restricted.</p>
<p>"Suffer people to think and speak; the public will judge: they will even
find means to correct authors. The surest method to purify the press, is to
render it free: obstacles irritate it: prohibitions and difficulties engender
the pamphlets complained of.</p>
<p>"Could despotism kill thought in its sanctuary, and prevent us from
communicating the essence of our ideas to the mind of our fellow-creatures, it
would do so. But not being able quite to pluck out the philosopher's tongue,
and cut off his hands, it establishes an inquisition, peoples the frontiers
with searchers, spreads satellites, and opens every package, in order to
interrupt the infallible progress of morality and truth. Useless and puerile
effort! Vain attack on the natural right of general society, and on the
patriotic rights of a particular one! Reason, from day to day, strikes nations
with a greater lustre, and will at last shine unclouded. It answers no purpose
to fear or persecute genius: nothing will extinguish in its hands the torch of
truth: the decree which its mouth pronounces, will be repeated by all posterity
against the unjust man. He wished to snatch from his fellow-creatures the most
noble of all privileges, that of thinking, which is inseparable from that of
existing: he will have manifested his weakness and folly; and he will merit the
twofold reproach of tyranny and impotence.</p>
<p>"When a very flat, very atrocious, and very calumniating libel appears under
a fellow's coat, 'tis a contest who shall have it first. People pay an
exorbitant price for it; the hawker who cannot read, and who wishes only to get
bread for his poor family, is apprehended, and sent to prison, where he shifts
for himself as well as he can.</p>
<p>"The more the libel is prohibited, the more eager we are for it. When we
have read it, and we see that nothing compensates for its mean temerity, we are
ashamed to have sought after it. We scarcely dare say, <i>we have read it</i>:
'tis the scum of low literature, and what is there without its scum?</p>
<p>"Contempt would be the surest weapon against those miserable productions
which are equally destitute of truth and talent.</p>
<p>"When will men in power know how to disdain equally the interested encomiums
of intriguing flatterers and the satires produced by hunger?</p>
<p>"Besides, those who sit in the first boxes must always expect some shafts
levelled at them by those who are in the pit; this becomes almost inevitable.
They must needs pay for their more commodious place: at least we attribute to
those who rule over us more enjoyments: they have some which they will avow,
solely with a view to raise themselves above the multitude. The human heart is
naturally envious. Let men in power then forgive or dissemble seasonably:
satire will fall to the ground; it is by shewing themselves impassible, that
they will disarm ardent malignity.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, there is a kind of odious libel, which, having every
characteristic of calumny, ought to be repressed. This is commonly nothing more
than the fruit of anonymous and envenomed revenge: for what are the secret
intrigues of courts to any man of letters? He will know time enough that which
will suit the pen of history.</p>
<p>"A libeller should be punished, as every thing violent ought to be. But the
parties interested should abstain from pronouncing; for where then would be the
proportion between the punishment and the crime?</p>
<p>"I apply not the name of libels to those atrocious and gratuitous
accusations against the private life of persons in power or individuals
unconnected with the government. Such injurious and unmeaning shafts are an
attack on honour: their authors should be punished.</p>
<p>"The police detected and apprehended one of its inspectors, who, being
charged to discover those libels, proposed the composition of similar ones to
some half-starved authors. After having laid for them this infernal snare for
the gain of a little money, he informed against them, and sold them to the
government.</p>
<p>"These miscreants, blinded by the eager thirst of a little gold, divert
themselves with the uneasiness of the government, and the more they see it in
the trances of apprehension, the more they delight in magnifying the danger,
and doubling its alarms.</p>
<p>"Liberty has rendered the English government insensible to libels. Disdain
is certain, before the work is commenced. If the satire is ingenious, people
laugh at it, without believing it; if it is flat, they despise it.</p>
<p>"Why cannot the French government partly adopt this indifference? A
contempt, more marked, for those vile and unknown pens that endeavour to wound
the sensibility of pride, would disgust the readers of the flat and lying
satires after which they are so eager, only because they imagine that the
government is really offended by them.</p>
<p>"It is to be observed that the productions that flatter more or less public
malignity, spread in fugitive sparks a central fire, which, if compressed,
would, perhaps, produce an explosion.</p>
<p>"Magistrates have not yet been seen disdaining those obscure shafts,
rendering themselves invulnerable from the openness of their proceedings, and
considering that praise will be mute, as long as criticism cannot freely raise
its voice.</p>
<p>"Let them then punish the flattery by which they are assailed, since they
are so much afraid of the libel that always contains some good truths: besides,
the public are there to judge the detractor; and no unjust satire ever
circulated a fort-night, without being branded with contempt.</p>
<p>"Ministers reciprocally deceive each other when they are attacked in this
manner; the one laughs at the storm which has just burst on the other, and
promotes secretly what he appears to prosecute openly and with warmth. It would
be a curious thing if one could bring to light the good tricks which the
votaries of ambition play each other in the road to power and fortune.</p>
<p>"There is nothing now printed in Paris, in the line of politics and history,
but satires and falsehoods. Foreigners look down with pity on every thing that
emanates from the capital on these matters. Other subjects begin to feel the
consequences of this, because the restraint laid on the mind is manifested even
in books of simple amusement. The presses of Paris are no longer to serve but
for posting-bills, and invitations to funerals and weddings. Almanacks are
already a subject too elevated, and the inquisition examines and garbles
them.</p>
<p>"When I see a book," says MERCIER, "sanctioned by the government, I would
lay a wager, without opening it, that this book contains political falsehoods.
The chief magistrate may well say: 'This piece of paper shall be worth a
thousand francs;' but he cannot say: 'Let this error become truth,' or, 'let
this truth no longer be anything but an error.' He may say it, but he can never
compel men's minds to adopt it.</p>
<p>"What is admirable in printing, is that these fine works, which do honour to
human genius, are not to be commanded or paid for; on the contrary, it is the
natural liberty of a generous mind, which unfolds itself in spite of dangers,
and makes a present to human nature, in spite of tyrants. This is what renders
the man of letters so commendable, and insures to him the gratitude of future
ages.</p>
<p>"O! worthy Englishmen! generous people, strangers to our shameful servitude,
carefully preserve among you the liberty of the press: it is the pledge of your
freedom. At this day, you alone are the representatives of nearly all mankind;
you uphold the dignity of the name of man. The thunderbolts, which strike the
pride and insolence of arbitrary power, issue from your happy island. Human
reason has found among you an asylum whence she may instruct the world. Your
books are not subject to an inquisition; and it would require a long comment to
explain to you in what manner permission is at length obtained for a flimsy
pamphlet, which no one will read, to be exposed for sale, and remain unsold, on
the <i>Quai de Gévres</i>.</p>
<p>"We are so absurd and so little in comparison to you," adds MERCIER, "that
you would be at a loss to conceive the excess of our weakness and
humiliation."</p>
<h2><a name="let78">LETTER LXXVIII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 9, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Among the national establishments in this metropolis, I know of none that
have experienced so great an amelioration, since the revolution, as the</p>
<p class="center">HOSPITALS AND OTHER CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS;</p>
<p>The civil hospitals in Paris now form two distinct classes. The one
comprehends the hospitals for the sick: the other, those for the indigent. The
former are devoted to the relief of suffering human nature; the latter serve as
an asylum to children, to the infirm, and to the aged indigent. All persons who
are not ill enough to be admitted of necessity into the hospital the nearest to
their residence, are obliged to present themselves to the <i>Bureau Central
d'Admissions</i>. Here they are examined, and if there be occasion, they
receive a ticket of admission for the hospital where their particular disorder
is treated. At the head of the hospitals for the sick stands that so long known
by the appellation of the</p>
<p class="center">HÔTEL-DIEU.</p>
<p>Formerly, nothing more horrid could be conceived than the spectacle
presented in this asylum for the afflicted. It was rather a charnel-house than
an hospital; and the name of the Creator, over the gate, which recalled to mind
the principle of all existence, served only to decorate the entrance of the
tomb of the living.</p>
<p>The <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>, which is situated in the <i>Parvis Notre-Dame</i>,
<i>Ile du Palais</i>, was founded as far back as the year 660 by St. Landry,
for the reception of the sick and maimed of both sexes, without any exception
of persons. Jews, Turks, infidels, pagans, protestants, and catholics were
alike admitted, without form or recommendation. Yet, though it contained but
1200 beds, and the number of patients very often exceeded 5000, and, on an
average, was never less than 2500, till the year 1786, no steps were taken for
enlarging the hospital, or providing elsewhere for those who could not be
conveniently accommodated in it. The dead were removed from the wards only on
visits made at a fixed time; so that it happened not unfrequently that a poor
helpless patient was compelled to remain for hours wedged in between two
corpses. The air or the neighbourhood was contaminated by the noisome
exhalations continually arising from this abode of pestilence, and that which
was breathed within the walls of the hospital was so contagious, as to turn a
trifling complaint into a dangerous disorder, and a simple wound into a
mortification.</p>
<p>In 1785, the attention of the government being called to this serious evil
by various memoirs, the <i>Academy of Sciences</i> was directed to investigate
the truth of the bold assertions made in these publications. A commission was
appointed; but as the revenues of the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> were immense, for a
long time it was impossible to obtain from the Governors any account of their
application. However, the Commissioners, directing their attention to the
principal object, reported as follows: "We first compared the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>
and the <i>Hôpital de la Charité</i> relative to their mortality. In 52 years,
the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>, out of 1,108,741 patients lost 244,720, which is one out
of four and a half. <i>La Charité</i>, where but one dies out of seven and a
half, would have lost only 168,700, whence results the frightful picture that
the <i>Hotel-Dieu</i>, in 52 years, has snatched from France 99,044 persons,
whose lives would have been saved, had the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> been as spacious,
in proportion, as <i>La Charité</i>. The loss in these 52 years answers to 1906
deaths per year, and that is nearly the tenth part of the total and annual loss
of Paris. The preservation of this hospital in the site it now occupies, and on
its present plan, therefore produces the same effect as a sort of plague which
constantly desolates the capital."</p>
<p>In consequence of this report, the hospital was enlarged so as to contain
about 2000 beds. Since the revolution, the improvements introduced into the
interior government of the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> have been great and rapid. Each
patient now has a bed to himself. Those attacked by contagious disorders are
transferred to the <i>Hospice St. Louis</i>. Insane persons are no longer
admitted; men, thus afflicted, are sent to a special hospital established at
<i>Charenton</i>; and women, to the <i>Salpétrière</i>. Nor are any females
longer received into the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> to lie-in; an hospital having been
established for the reception of pregnant women. At the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>,
every method has been put in practice to promote the circulation of air, and
expel the insalubrious miasmata. One of these, I think, well deserves to be
adopted in England.</p>
<p>In the French hospitals, one ward at least is now always kept empty. The
moment it becomes so by the removal of the patients into another, the walls are
whitewashed, and the air is purified by the fumigation with muriatic acid,
according to the plan first proposed by GUYTON-MORVEAU. This operation is
alternately performed in each ward in succession; that which has been the
longest occupied being purified the first, and left empty till it is again
wanted.</p>
<p>The number of hospitals in Paris has been considerably augmented. They are
all supported by the government, and not, like those in England, by private
benefactions. Sick children of both sexes, from the time of suckling to the age
of sixteen, are no longer admitted into the different hospitals; but are
received into a special hospital, extremely well arranged, and in a fine, airy
situation, beyond the <i>Barrière de Sèvres</i>. Two institutions have been
formed for the aged, infirm and indigent, who pay, on entrance, a moderate sum.
One of these charities is without the <i>Barrière d'Enfer</i>; the other, in
the <i>Faubourg St. Martin</i>. In the same <i>faubourg</i>, a <i>Maison de
Santé</i> is established, where the sick are treated on paying thirty
<i>sous</i> a day.</p>
<p>An hospital for gratuitous vaccination, founded by the Prefect of the
department of La Seine, is now open for the continual treatment of the cow-pox,
and the distribution of the matter to all parts of France.</p>
<p>In general, the charitable institutions in Paris have also undergone very
considerable improvements since the revolution; for instance, the male orphans,
admitted, to the number of two thousand, into the asylum formerly called <i>La
Pitié</i>, in the <i>Faubourg St. Victor</i>, used to remain idle. They were
employed only to follow funeral processions. At present, they are kept at work,
and instructed in some useful trade.</p>
<p>A new institution for female orphans has been established in the <i>Faubourg
St. Antoine</i>; for, here, the two sexes are not at present received into the
same house, whether hospital or other charitable institution. In consequence of
which, Paris now contains two receptacles for <i>Incurables</i>, in lieu of the
one which formerly existed.</p>
<p>The place of the <i>Hôpital des Enfans-Trouvés</i> is also supplied by an
establishment, on a large scale, called the</p>
<p class="center">HOSPICE DE LA MATERNITÉ.</p>
<p>It is divided into two branches, each of which occupies a separate house.
The one for foundlings, in the <i>Rue de la Bourbe</i>, is intended for the
reception of children abandoned by their parents. Here they are reared, if not
sent into the country to be suckled. The other, in the <i>Rue d'Enfer</i>,
which may be considered as the General Lying-in Hospital of Paris, is destined
for the reception of pregnant women. Upwards of 1500 are here delivered every
year.</p>
<p>As formerly, no formality is now required for the admission of new-born
infants. In the old Foundling-Hospital, the number annually received exceeded
8000. It is not near so great at present. To those who reflect on the ravages
made among the human race by war, during which disease sweeps off many more
than are killed in battle, it is a most interesting sight to behold fifty or
sixty little foundlings assembled in one ward, where they are carefully fed
till they are provided with wet nurses.</p>
<p>I must here correct a mistake into which I have been betrayed, in my letter
of the 26th of December, respecting the present destination of</p>
<p class="center">LA SALPÊTRIÈRE.</p>
<p>It is no longer used as a house of correction for dissolute women.
Prostitutes, taken up by the police, are now carried to St. Lazare, in the
<i>Rue St. Denis</i>. Those in want of medical aid, for disorders incident to
their course of life, are not sent to <i>Bicêtre</i>, but to the
<i>ci-devant</i> monastery of the Capucins, in the <i>Rue Caumartin</i>.</p>
<p>At present, the <i>Salpêtrière</i> forms an <i>hospice</i> for the reception
of indigent or infirm old women, and young girls, brought up in the
Foundling-Hospital, are placed here to be instructed in needle-work and making
lace. Female idiots and mad women are also taken care of in a particular part
of this very extensive building.</p>
<p>The Salpêtrière was erected by Lewis XIII, and founded as an hospital, by
Lewis XIV, in 1656. The facade has a majestic appearance. Before the
revolution, this edifice was said to lodge 6000 souls, and even now, it cannot
contain less than 4000. By the <i>Plan of Paris</i>, you will see its
situation, to the south-east of the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>.</p>
<p>I shall also avail myself of the opportunity of correcting another mistake
concerning</p>
<p class="center">BICÊTRE.</p>
<p>This place has now the same destination for men that the Salpétrière has for
women. There is a particular hospital, lately established, for male venereal
patients, in the <i>Rue du Faubourg St. Jacques</i>.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p class="right"><i>March 9, in continuation.</i></p>
<p>Previously to the decree of the 19th of August 1792, which suppressed the
universities and other scientific institutions, there existed in France
Faculties and Colleges of Physicians, as well as Colleges and Commonalities of
Surgeons. From one of those unaccountable contradictions of which the
revolution affords so many instances, these were also suppressed at a time when
they were becoming most necessary for supplying the French armies with medical
men. But as soon as the fury of the revolutionary storm began to abate, the
re-establishment of Schools of Medicine was one of the first objects that
engaged attention.</p>
<p>Till these latter times, Medicine and Surgery, separated from each other,
mutually contended for pre-eminence. Each had its forms and particular schools.
They seemed to have divided between them suffering human nature, instead of
uniting for its relief. On both sides, men of merit despised such useless
distinctions; they felt that the curative art ought to comprehend all the
knowledge and all the means that can conduce to its success; but these elevated
ideas were combated by narrow minds, which, not being capable of embracing
general considerations, always attach to details a great importance. The
revolution terminated these disputes, by involving both parties in the same
misfortunes.</p>
<p>At the time of the re-establishment of Public Instruction, the <i>Schools of
Health</i>, founded at Paris, Montpelier, and Strasburg, on plans digested by
men the most enlightened, presented a complete body of instruction relative to
every branch of the curative art. Physics and chemistry, which form the basis
of that art, were naturally included, and nothing that could contribute to its
perfection, in the present state of the sciences, was forgotten. The plan of
instruction is fundamentally the same in all these schools; but is more
extensive in the principal one, that is, in the</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF PARIS.</p>
<p>This very striking monument of modern architecture, situated in the
<i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>, owes its erection to the partiality which Lewis XV
entertained for the art of surgery. That monarch preferred it to every science;
he was fond of conversing on it, and took such an interest in it, that, in
order to promote its improvement, he built this handsome edifice for the
<i>ci-devant Académie et Écoles de Chirurgie</i>. The architect was
GONDOUIN.</p>
<p>The façade, extending nearly two hundred feet, presents a peristyle of the
Ionic order. The interior distribution of this building corresponds with the
elegance of its exterior. It contains a valuable library, a cabinet of
anatomical preparations (among which is a skeleton that presents a rare
instance of a general <i>anchilosis</i>) and imitations in wax, a chemical
laboratory, a vast collection of chirurgical and philosophical instruments, and
a magnificent amphitheatre, the first stone of which was laid by Lewis XVI in
December 1774. This lecture-room will conveniently hold twelve hundred persons,
and its form and arrangement are such, that a pupil seated the farthest from
the subject under dissection, can see all the demonstrations of the Professor
as well as if placed near the marble table.</p>
<p>In one wing of the building is an <i>Hospice de Perfectionnement</i>,
formerly instituted for the reception of rare chirurgical cases only; but into
which other patients, labouring under internal disorders of an extraordinary
nature, are now likewise admitted.</p>
<p>To this school are attached from twenty to thirty Professors, who lecture on
anatomy and physiology; medical chemistry and pharmacy; medical physics;
pathology, internal and external; natural history, as connected with medicine,
and botany; operative medicine; external and internal clinical cases, and the
modern improvements in treating them; midwifery, and all disorders incident to
women; the physical education of children; the history of medicine, and its
legitimate practice; the doctrine of Hippocrates, and history of rare cases;
medical bibliography, and the demonstration of the use of drugs and chirurgical
instruments. There are also a chief anatomist, a painter, and a modeller in
wax. The lectures are open to the public as well as to the students, who are
said to exceed a thousand. Besides this part of instruction, the pupils
practise anatomical, chirurgical, and chemical operations. To the number of one
hundred and twenty, they form a practical school, divided into three classes,
and are successively distributed into three of the clinical hospitals in Paris.
At an annual competition, prizes are awarded to the greatest proficients.</p>
<p>Although this school is so numerously attended, and has produced several
skilful professors, celebrated anatomists, and a multitude of distinguished
pupils, yet it appears that, since there has been no regular admission for
physicians and surgeons, the most complete anarchy has prevailed in the medical
line. The towns and villages in France are overrun by quacks, who deal out
poison and death with an audacity which the existing laws are unable to check.
Under the title of <i>Officiers de Santé</i>, they impose on the credulity of
the public, in the most dangerous manner, by the distribution of nostrums for
every disorder. <a name="let78fr1"></a>To put a stop to this alarming evil, it
is in contemplation to promulgate a law, enacting that no one shall in future
practise in France as a physician or surgeon, without having been examined and
received into one of the six Special Schools of Medicine, or as an officer of
health, without having studied a certain number of years, walked the hospitals,
and also passed a regular examination.[<a href="#let78f1">1</a>]
<p>At the medical school of Paris are held the meetings of the</p>
<p class="center">SOCIETY OF MEDICINE.</p>
<p>It was instituted for the purpose of continuing the labours of the
<i>ci-devant</i> Royal Society of Medicine and the old Academy of Surgery. With
this view, it is charged to keep up a correspondence, not only with the medical
men resident within the limits of the Republic, but also with those of foreign
countries, respecting every object that can tend to the progress of the art of
healing.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>As far back as the year 1777, there existed in Paris a college of Pharmacy.
The apothecaries, composing this college, had formed, at their own expense, an
establishment for instruction relative to the curative art, in their laboratory
and garden in the <i>Rue de l'Arbalêtre</i>. Since the revolution, the
acknowledged utility of this institution has caused it to be maintained under
the title of the</p>
<p class="center">GRATUITOUS SCHOOL OF PHARMACY.</p>
<p>Here are delivered <i>gratis</i>, by two professors in each department,
public lectures on pharmaceutic chemistry, pharmaceutic natural history, and
botany. When the courses are finished, prizes are annually distributed to the
pupils who distinguish themselves most by their talents and knowledge.</p>
<p>In the year 1796, the apothecaries of Paris, animated by a desire to render
this establishment still more useful, formed themselves into a society, by the
name of the</p>
<p class="center">FREE SOCIETY OF APOTHECARIES.</p>
<p>Its object is to contribute to the progress of the arts and sciences,
particularly pharmacy, chemistry, botany, and natural history. This society
admits, as free and corresponding associates, <i>savans</i> of all the other
departments of France and of foreign countries, who cultivate those sciences
and others analogous to them. Some of the most enlightened men in France are to
be found among its members.</p>
<p>The advantageous changes made in the teaching of medicine, since the
revolution, appear to consist chiefly in the establishment of clinical
lectures. The teaching of the sciences, accessory to medicine, partakes more or
less advantageously of the great progress made in that of chemistry. It seems
that, in general, the students in medicine grant but a very limited confidence
to accredited opinions, and that they recur to observation and experience much
more than they did formerly. As for the changes which have occurred in the
practice of medicine, I think it would be no easy matter to appreciate them
with any degree of exactness. Besides, sufficient time has not yet elapsed
since the establishment of the new mode of teaching, for them to assume a
marked complexion. It is, however, to be observed that, by the death of the
celebrated DÉSAULT, Surgery has sustained a loss which is not yet repaired, nor
will be perhaps for ages.</p>

<h2><a name="let79">LETTER LXXIX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 12, 1802.</i></p>
<p>From the account I have given you of the Public Schools here, you will have
perceived that, since the revolution, nothing has been neglected which could
contribute to the mental improvement of the male part of the rising generation.
But as some parents are averse to sending their children to these National
Schools, there are now established in Paris a great number of</p>
<p class="center">PRIVATE SEMINARIES FOR YOUTH OF BOTH SEXES.</p>
<p>Several of these are far superior to any that previously existed in France,
and are really of a nature to excite admiration, when we consider the cruel
divisions which have distracted this country. But it seems that if, for a time,
instruction, both public and private, was suspended, no sooner were the French
permitted to breathe than a sudden and salutary emulation arose among those who
devoted themselves to the important task of conducting these private schools.
The great advantage which they appear to me to have over establishments of a
similar description in England, is that the scholars are perfectly grounded in
whatever they are taught; the want of which, among us, occasions many a youth
to forget the greater part of what he has learned long before he has attained
the years of manhood.</p>
<p>If several of the schools for boys here are extremely well conducted, some
of those for girls appear to be governed with no less care and judgment. In
order to be enabled to form an opinion on the present mode of bringing up young
girls in France, I have made a point of investigating the subject. I shall, in
consequence, endeavour to shew you the contrast which strikes me to have
occurred here in</p>
<p class="center">FEMALE EDUCATION.</p>
<p>In France, convents had, at all times, prior to the revolution, enjoyed the
exclusive privilege of bringing up young women; and some families had, for a
century past, preserved the habit of sending all their daughters to be St.
Ursulas, in order to enter afterwards into the world as virtuous wives and
tender mothers. The natural result was, that, if the principles of excessive
piety which had been communicated to them remained deeply engraved in their
heart, they employed the whole day in the duties required by the catholic
religion; and the confessor who dictated all these habitual practices, not
unfrequently became the director of the temporal concerns of the family, as
well as the spiritual. If the young girls, in emerging from the cells of a
convent, were disposed to lay aside their religious practices, in order to
adopt the customs and pleasures of the world, this sudden transition, from one
extreme to the other, made them at once abandon, not only the puerile minutiæ,
but also the sacred principles of religion. There was no medium. They either
became outrageous devotees, and, neglecting the respectable duties of
housewives and mistresses of a family, wrapped themselves up in a great hood,
and were incessantly on their knees before the altars of the churches, or, on
the other hand, rushed into extravagance and dissipation, and, likewise,
deserting a family which claimed their care, dishonoured themselves by the
licentiousness of their manners.</p>
<p>At the present time, many women of good abilities and character, deprived of
their property by the vicissitudes of the revolution, have established, in
Paris and its environs, seminaries, where young girls receive such advice as is
most useful to females who are destined to live in the world, and acquirements,
which, by employing them agreeably several hours in the day, contribute to the
interior happiness of their family, and make them find charms in a domestic
life. In short, the superiority of female education in France is decidedly in
favour of the present system, whether considered in regard to mental
improvement, health, or beauty. With respect to the morals inculcated in these
modern French boarding schools, the best answer to all the prejudices might be
entertained against them, is that the men, who have married women there
educated, find that they prove excellent wives, and that their accomplishments
serve only to embellish their virtues.</p>
<h2><a name="let80">LETTER LXXX.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 14, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>I plead guilty to your censure in not having yet furnished you with any
remarks on the origin of this capital; but you will recollect that I engaged
only to give you a mere sketch; indeed, it would require more time and talent
than I can command to present you with a finished picture. I speak of things
just as they happen to occur to my mind; and provided my letters bring you
acquainted with such objects here as are most deserving of attention, my
purpose will be fully accomplished. However, in compliance with your pressing
request, I shall now briefly retrace the</p>
<p class="center">PROGRESSIVE AGGRANDISEMENT OF PARIS.</p>
<p>Without hazarding any vague conjectures, I may, I think, safely affirm that
Cæsar is the first historian who makes mention of this city. In the seventh
book of his Commentaries, that conqueror relates that he sent his lieutenant
Labienus towards Lutetia; this was the name given by the Gauls to the capital
of the Parisii. It was then entirely contained within that island on the Seine,
which, at the present day, is called <i>l'Ile du Palais</i>.</p>
<p>In comparison to the capitals of the other provinces of Gaul, <i>Lutetia</i>
was but a sorry village; its houses were small, of a round form, built of wood
and earth, and covered with straw and reeds.</p>
<p>After having conquered <i>Lutetia</i>, the Romans embellished it with a
palace, surrounded it by walls, and erected, at the head of each of the two
bridges leading to it, a fortress, one of which stood on the site of the prison
called <i>Le Grand Châtelet</i>; and the other, on that of <i>Le Petit
Châtelet</i>. The Yonne, the Marne, and the Oise, being rivers which join the
Seine, suggested the idea of establishing a trading company by water, in order
to facilitate, by those channels, the circulation of warlike stores and
provisions. These merchants were called <i>Nautæ Parisiaci</i>. The Romans also
erected, near the left bank of the Seine, a magnificent palace and an aqueduct.
This palace was called <i>Thermæ</i>, on account of its tepid baths.</p>
<p>Julian, being charged to defend Gaul against the irruptions of the
barbarians, took up his residence in these <i>Thermæ</i> in 360, two years
before he was proclaimed emperor, in the square which was in front of this
palace. "I was in winter-quarters in my dear <i>Lutetia</i>," says he in his
<i>Misopogon</i>. "Thus is named, in Gaul, the little capital of the
Parisii."&mdash;"It occupies," observes Abbon, "an inconsiderable island,
surrounded by walls, the foot of which is bathed by the river. The entrance to
it, on each side, is by a wooden bridge."</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the fifth century, this city passed from the dominion
of the Romans to that of the Francs. It was besieged by Childeric I. In 508,
Clovis declared it the capital of his kingdom. The long stay which that prince
made in it, contributed to its embellishment. Charlemagne founded in it a
celebrated school. A little time after, another was established in the abbey of
<i>St. Germain-des-Prés</i>. In the course of the ninth century, it was
besieged and pillaged three times by the Normans.</p>
<p>Philip Augustus surrounded Paris with walls, and comprised in that inclosure
a great number of small towns and hamlets in its vicinity. This undertaking
occupied twenty years, having been begun in 1190, and finished in 1211. The
same king was also the first who caused the streets of this city to be paved.
The wars of the English required new fortifications; and, under king John,
ditches were dug round the city; and the <i>Bastille</i>, erected. These works
were continued during the reigns of Charles V and Charles VI.</p>
<p>Francis I, the restorer of literature and of the arts, neglected nothing
that might conduce to the farther embellishment of this capital. He caused
several new streets to be made, many Gothic edifices to be pulled down, and
was, in France, the first who revived Greek architecture, the remains of which,
buried by the hand of time, or mutilated by that of barbarians, being collected
and compared at Rome, began to improve the genius of celebrated artists, and,
in the sequel, led to the production of masterpieces.</p>
<p>The kings, his successors, executed a part of the projects of that prince,
and this extensive city imperceptibly lost its irregular and Gothic aspect. The
removal of the houses, which, not long since, encumbered the bridges, and
intercepted the current of air, has diffused cheerfulness and salubrity.</p>
<p>You will pardon me, I trust, if I here make a retrograde movement, not to
recapitulate the aggrandisement of Paris, but to retrace rapidly the
progressive amelioration of the manners of its inhabitants. The latter paved
the way to the former.</p>
<p>Under the first kings of France of the third race, justice was administered
in a summary way; the king, the count, and the viscount heard the parties, and
gave a prompt sentence, or else left the controversy to be decided by a pitched
battle, if it was of too intricate a nature. No colleges then existed here; the
clergy only keeping schools near the Cathedral of <i>Notre-Dame</i> for those
who were intended for holy orders. The nobles piqued themselves on extreme
ignorance, and as many of them could not even sign their own name, they dipped
their glove in ink, and stamped it on the parchment as their signature. They
lived on their estates, and if they were obliged to pass three or four days in
town, they affected to appear always in boots, in order that they might not be
taken for <i>vassals</i>. Ten men were sufficient for the collection of all the
taxes. There were no more than two gates to the city; and under Lewis surnamed
<i>le Gros</i>, from his corpulency, the duties at the north gate produced no
more than twelve francs a year.</p>
<p>Philip Augustus, being fond of literature, welcomed and protected men of
learning. It had appeared to revive under Charlemagne; but the ravages of the
Normans occasioned it to sink again into oblivion till the reign of Lewis the
Young, father of Philip Augustus. Under the latter, the schools of Paris became
celebrated; they were resorted to, not only from the distant provinces, but
from foreign countries. The quarter, till lately called <i>l'Université</i>,
became peopled; and, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was covered by
colleges and monasteries. Philip the Fair rendered the Parliament sedentary. He
prohibited duelling in civil contentions; and a person might have recourse to a
court of justice, without being under the necessity of fighting. Anne de
Bretagne, great and majestic in every thing, was desirous of having a court.
Ladies who, till then, were born in one castle only to marry and die in
another, came to Paris. They were unwilling to leave it, and men followed them
thither. All these circumstances increased its inhabitants to a thirtieth part
beyond their former number.</p>
<p>The wars of religion under Charles IX and Henry III rendered gold and silver
a little more common, by the profanations of the Calvinists, who pillaged the
churches, and converted into specie the sacred vases, as well as the shrines
and statues of saints. The vast sums of money which the court of Spain lavished
in Paris, to support the League, had also diffused a certain degree of
affluence among no inconsiderable number of citizens; and it is to be remarked
that, under Henry IV, several handsome streets were finished in less than a
year.</p>
<p>Henry IV was the first of the kings of France who embellished Paris with
regular squares, or open spaces, decorated with the different orders of
architecture. After having nearly finished the <i>Pont Neuf</i>, he built the
<i>Place Royale</i>, now called <i>Place des Fédérés</i>, and also the <i>Place
Dauphine</i>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the administration of Cardinal Richelieu, there no longer
existed in France more than one master; and the petty tyrants in the provinces,
who had fortified themselves so long in their castles against the royal
authority, were seen to come to court, to solicit the most paltry lodging with
all the servility of courtiers, and at the same time erect mansions in town
with all the splendour of men inflated by pride and power. At last came the
reign of Lewis XIV, and presently Paris knew no limits. Its gates were
converted into arcs of triumph, and its ditches, being filled up and planted
with trees, became public walks. When one considers the character of that
monarch, it should seem that Paris ought to have been more embellished under
his reign. <a name="let80fr1"></a>In fact, had Lewis XIV expended on Paris
one-fourth part of the money which he lavished on
Versailles,[<a href="#let80f1">1</a>] it would have become the most astonishing
city in Europe.</p>
<p>However, its great extent and population, magnificent edifices, celebrated
national establishments of learning and science, rich libraries, curious
cabinets, where lessons of knowledge and genius present themselves to those who
have a taste for them, together with its theatres and other places of public
entertainment, have long rendered Paris deserving of the admiration of
enlightened nations.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, Paris contained 46 parish churches, and 20 others
answering the same purpose, 11 abbeys, and 133 monasteries or convents of men
and women, 13 colleges, 15 public seminaries, and 26 hospitals. To these must
be added the three royal habitations, the <i>Louvre</i>, the <i>Tuileries</i>,
and the <i>Luxembourg</i>, also the <i>Hôtel des Invalides</i>, the <i>Palais
Royal</i>, the <i>Palais Bourbon</i>, and a great number of magnificent hotels,
inhabited by titled or wealthy persons.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, several of these buildings have been destroyed; almost
all the monasteries and convents, together with the churches belonging to them,
have been sold as national property, and either demolished for the sake of the
materials, or converted to different uses. Fifteen principal churches, besides
the <i>Pantheon</i>, the <i>Invalides</i>, <i>Val-de-Grace</i>, the
<i>Sorbonne</i>, and a few others, were preserved as national temples, intended
for the celebration of <i>decadary fétes</i>, and for a time rendered common to
every sort of worship. Most of the old churches were of Gothic architecture,
and not much to be commended with respect to art; but several of them were
models of boldness, from the lightness of their construction.</p>
<p>The colleges, as I have before observed, are replaced by public schools and
private seminaries of every description. The number of the houses in Paris,
many of which are from five to eight stories in height, has been estimated at
upwards of 80,000. The number of its inhabitants appears to have been
over-rated. By an official statement, in which foreigners are not included, it
contains no more than 630,000 souls.</p>
<p>During the last year of the republican era, the number of males born in
Paris was 9296; and that of females, 9177; making the general total of births
18,473, of which the males, born out of wedlock, amounted to 1792; and the
females, to 1852. The number of persons deceased, within the same period, was
10,446 males, and 10,301 females; making together 20,747. The annual decrease
in population was consequently 2274 souls. The number of marriages was 3826;
and that of divorces, 720; which is nearly 2 out of 11.</p>
<p>The ancient division of Paris consisted of three parts; namely, <i>La
Cité</i>, <i>l'Université</i>, and <i>La Ville</i>. <i>La Cite</i> comprised
all the <i>Ile du Palais</i>. This is the parent-stock of the capital, whence
have extended, like so many branches, the numerous quarters by which it is
surrounded. <i>L'Université</i> was bordered by the Seine, the <i>Faubourg St.
Bernard</i>, <i>St. Victor</i>, <i>St. Marcel</i>, <i>St. Jacques</i>, and the
<i>Faubourg St. Germain</i>. The number of colleges in this quarter, had
obtained it the name of <i>Le Pays Latin</i>. <i>La Ville</i> comprehended all
the rest of the capital, not included in the suburbs.</p>
<p>At present, Paris is divided into twelve mayoralties (as you will see by the
<i>Plan</i>), each of which is presided by a central office of municipal
police. The <i>Faubourgs</i> retain their ancient names; but those of many of
the streets have been changed in the course of the revolution. The <i>Chaussée
d'Antin</i>, which comprises the new streets north of the <i>Boulevard
Italien</i>, is now the most fashionable part of the town. The houses here are
chiefly inhabited by bankers and persons living in affluence; and apartments in
this neighbourhood are considerably dearer than in the <i>Faubourg St.
Germain</i>, which, comparatively speaking, is deserted.</p>
<p>I have already described the <i>Porte St. Denis</i> and the <i>Porte St.
Martin</i>, which are nothing more than arcs of triumph. In proportion as the
limits of the capital became extended, the real gates were removed, but
reappeared under the name of <i>barrières</i>. These costly edifices were
constructed during the ministry of CALONNE, under the direction of LEDOUX, the
architect, who has taken a pleasure in varying their form and character. One
represents an observatory; another, a chapel; some have the appearance of
rusticated buildings; others, that of temples. Under the old <i>régime</i> too,
the farmers-general had inclosed Paris with a high wall, the extent of which
has been estimated at upwards of 10,000 toises. This wall displeased the eye of
the Parisians, and, when they were out of humour, induced them to murmur
loudly. Whence the following <i>jeu de mots</i>:</p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Le mur, murant Paris, rend Paris murmurout."</i></p>
<p>During the revolution, it was by no means uncommon to shut the
<i>barrières</i>, in order to serve the purposes of party, and favour the
arrest of particular persons. To the number of sixty, they are placed at the
principal outlets of the suburbs, and occupied by custom-house officers, whose
business is to collect duties, and watch that no contraband goods find their
way into the city. Formerly, when every carriage entering Paris was stopped and
examined (which is not the case at present), the self-importance of these
<i>commis des barrières</i> could be equalled only by their ignorance.</p>
<p>A traveller arriving from Egypt brought with him a mummy. The case being
long, he chose not to fasten it on to his post-chaise, but sent it to Paris by
water. When it was landed at the <i>barrière</i>, the custom-house officers
opened it, and, finding it to contain a black-looking body, decided that this
was a man who had been baked in an oven. They took the linen bandages for his
burnt shirt, and, after drawing up a <i>procès-verbal</i> in due form, sent the
mummy to the <i>Morne</i>, where dead bodies are exposed in order to be owned.
When the proprietor reached Paris, he went to the <i>barrière</i> to claim his
mummy. The <i>commis</i> listened to him and stared at him with astonishment.
He grew angry, and at length broke out into a violent passion; when one of the
searchers, in a whisper, advised him to decamp, if he wished to avoid the
gallows. The traveller, stupified, was obliged to apply to the Minister of the
Police, and, with some difficulty, recovered from the <i>Morne</i> his Egyptian
prince or princess, who, after having been preserved 2000 years, was on the
point of being buried in a catholic cemetery, instead of figuring in a cabinet
of curiosities.</p>

<h2><a class="let81">LETTER LXXXI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 17, 1802.</i></p>
<p>An object which must infallibly strike the eye of the attentive observer,
who has not visited this capital within the last ten years, is the change in
the style of</p>
<p class="center">FRENCH FURNITURE.</p>
<p>This remark may, at first sight, appear trivial; but a second view of the
subject will produce reflections on the frivolity of this people, even amidst
their intestine commotions, and at the same time shew that they are, in no
small degree, indebted to the influence of those events for the taste which is
to be distinguished in the new productions of their industry, and, in general,
for the progress they have made, not only in the mechanical arts, but also in
the sciences of every description. This will appear the more extraordinary, as
it should seem natural to presume that the persecution which the protectors of
the arts and sciences experienced, in the course of the revolution, was likely
to produce quite a contrary effect. But the man of science and the artist, each
abandoned to himself, acquired, in that forlorn situation, a knowledge and a
taste which very frequently are the result of long study only, seconded by
encouragement from the wealthy.</p>
<p>The apartments of the fine ladies, of the rich, of the bankers, and
merchants in Paris, and generally speaking, of all those who, from their
business and connexions, have most intercourse with the public and with
foreigners, are furnished in the modern mode, that is, in the antique taste.
Many of the French artists, being destitute of employment, were compelled
through necessity to seek it; some entered into the warehouse of the
upholsterer to direct the shape and disposition of his hangings; some, into the
manufactory of the paper-maker to furnish him with new patterns; and others,
into the shop of the cabinet-maker to sell him sketches of antique forms. Had
the easels of these artists been occupied by pictures no sooner finished than
paid for, the Grecian bed would not have expelled the <i>lit à la
Polonaise</i>, in vogue here before the revolution; the Etruscan designs would
not have succeeded to the Chinese paper; nor would the curtains with Persian
borders have been replaced by that elegant drapery which retraces the pure and
simple taste of the people of Attica.</p>
<p>The elegant forms of the modern French <i>secrétaires</i>, commodes, chairs,
&amp;c. have also been copied from the Greeks and Romans. The ornaments of
these are either bronzed or gilt, and are uncommonly well finished. In general,
they represent heads of men, women, and animals, designed after the antique.
Caryatides are sometimes introduced, as well as Egyptian attributes; the arms
of the chairs being frequently decorated with sphinxes. In short, on entering
the residence of a <i>parvenu</i>, you would fancy yourself suddenly
transported into the house of a wealthy Athenian; and these new favourites of
Fortune can, without crossing the threshold of their own door, study chaste
antiquity, and imbibe a taste for other knowledge, connected with it, in which
they are but little versed.</p>
<p>Mahogany is the wood employed for making these modern articles of furniture,
whose forms are no less varied than elegant; advantages which cause them to be
preferred to the ancient. But the latter, though heavy in their construction,
are, nevertheless, thought, by some persons, superior to the former in point of
solidity and convenience. The old-fashioned bedsteads and chairs are generally
of oak, painted or gilt, and are covered with silk or tapestry of different
patterns. The <i>ci-devant</i> nobles appear to be greatly attached to them,
and preserve them as monuments, which supply the place of the titles and
parchments they were forced to burn during the sanguinary periods of the
revolution. But this taste is not exclusive; several of the Parisian
<i>bourgeois</i>, either from economy, or from a wish to appear to have
belonged to that class, shew no less eagerness to possess these spoils of the
<i>noblesse</i>, as furniture for their apartments.</p>
<p>While I am speaking of furniture, it naturally occurs to me that I have not
yet taken you to visit</p>
<p class="center">LES GOBELINS.</p>
<p>This national manufactory, which is situated in the <i>Faubourg St.
Marcel</i>, takes its name from two famous Flemish dyers, who settled in Paris
under Francis I. In 1662, COLBERT purchased part of the old premises where the
<i>Gobelins</i> had carried on their business, and there opened an
establishment under the direction of LE BRUN. It was not confined to the
manufacture of tapestry only, but was composed of painters, sculptors,
engravers, goldsmiths, watch-makers, lapidaries, and other artists and workmen
of almost every description, whose pupils and apprentices here acquired their
freedom.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, tapestry alone is manufactured here, on two sorts of
looms, distinguished by the denominations of <i>haute</i> and <i>basso
lisse</i>, which are fully explained in an interesting <i>Notice</i>, published
by the intelligent director, GUILLAUMOT, who, it seems, has introduced into
each of these branches several recent improvements.</p>
<p>The art of making tapestry originated in England and Flanders, where the
cartoons of RAPHAEL and JULIO ROMANO were coarsely copied. It was gradually
improved in France, and is now brought here to the greatest perfection. Indeed,
a piece of <i>Gobelin</i> tapestry may be called a picture painted with wool
and silk; but its admirable execution produces an illusion so complete, that
skilful painters have been seen to lay their hands on this tapestry, to
convince themselves that it was not a real painting.</p>
<p>Tapestry is now entirely out of fashion; and, with the exception of a few
small fancy-pieces, the productions of this manufactory are intended solely for
the decoration of the national palaces and other public buildings. In 1790 the
blood-thirsty MARAT strove hard to annihilate this establishment, by
exaggerating the expenses of its maintenance. In 1789, their real amount was
144,000 francs; 116 journeymen and 18 apprentices were then employed, and paid
in proportion to their merit and to the quantity of work they performed. In
1791, they were divided into classes, and paid by the day. This regulation
produces less work, but its execution is more perfect, since no motive of
interest induces the workman to neglect his performance. At present, its
expenses cannot be so great, as the number of persons employed is less than
100. Should the penury of the finances not allow the means of re-establishing
pupils, this manufactory will be extinguished like a lamp for want of oil.
Twenty years are necessary to make a good manufacturer of tapestry; those of
the first abilities are now nearly 70 years of age, and therefore it seems high
time to prepare for them competent successors.</p>
<p>At <i>Chaillot</i>, we shall find another national manufactory, somewhat
analogous to the former, and which also claims the attention of the curious
observer. From having been fixed in a place originally occupied by a
soap-house, it is called</p>
<p class="center">LA SAVONNERIE.</p>
<p>It was established, as far back as 1615, at the instigation of PIERRE
DUPONT, who, being forced to quit his native land by the civil commotions
arising from the League, went to the Levant. Having seen carpets made without
taste or design in that country, he conceived the idea of introducing a
manufactory of this kind into France, where it would be susceptible of
considerable improvement from the exercise of the arts unknown in Turkey. The
project was approved by Henry IV, who first gave DUPONT an establishment in the
<i>Louvre</i>, which was afterwards transferred to its present situation.</p>
<p>Like the <i>Gobelins</i>, the national manufactory of the <i>Savonnerie</i>
is, and has been, constantly supported by the government, and like it too,
contributes to the decoration of the national palaces, &amp;c. Nothing, in the
shape of carpets, can answer this purpose better than those manufactured here,
the colours of which are extremely brilliant. The close, velvety texture of the
manufacture gives a peculiar expression to objects which are copied from
nature, such as the hair of animals, the down of fruit, and the lustre of
flowers.</p>
<p>From its foundation till the year 1789, this manufactory continued to be
under the direction of a contractor, who delivered the carpeting to the
government at the rate of 220 francs per square ell. At the revolution, new
regulations were established; the workmen were paid by the day, and classed
according to their merit. In consequence, though less work is performed, it is
executed with greater perfection.</p>
<p>The present government has lately ordered the old patterns, which were
overloaded with ornaments and flowers, to be suppressed, and replaced by
compositions more simple, more elegant, and infinitely more tasteful. I
understand that the workmen are to be put to task-work, under the
superintendance of the respectable administrator DUVIVIER, who informs me that
the present price of this carpeting amounts to 300 francs per square
<i>mètre</i> (<i>circa</i> 3 ft. 3 inc. English measure). In 1789, thirty
persons were employed here, at from 30 to 50 <i>sous</i> a day. At present,
there are no more than twenty, who daily earn, on an average, 3 francs, and are
lodged in the buildings of the manufactory.</p>
<p>Before I lay down my pen, I shall notice a national establishment, equally
connected with the subject of this letter; I mean the</p>
<p class="center">MANUFACTORY OF PLATE-GLASS.</p>
<p>Like all the other French manufactories, this has suffered from the
revolution and the war; but it has now nearly resumed its former activity,
owing to the effects of the peace and the laudable exertions of the government
to revive commerce. At this time, it gives employment to about 600 persons.</p>
<p>Before COLBERT founded the present establishment, which is situated in the
<i>Rue de Reuilli</i>, <i>Faubourg St. Antoine</i>, the French drew their
plate-glass from Venice; but they have left their masters in this branch very
far behind them, and now make mirrors of dimensions of which the Venetians had
no idea. These plates are cast at St. Gobin, near La Fère, in the department of
L'Aisne, and sent to Paris to be polished and silvered. Here you may witness
the process employed in each of these different operations.</p>
<p>A method of joining together two small plates of glass in such a manner that
no mark appears, has, I am informed, been lately discovered in Paris. It is
said, however, not to be applicable to those of large dimensions. After the
operation of this species of soldering, the plates are silvered.</p>
<h2><a name="let82">LETTER LXXXII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 19, 1802.</i></p>
<p>As the period of my stay here is drawing rapidly towards a conclusion, I
find much less leisure for writing; otherwise I should, in my last letter, have
made you acquainted with an establishment not irrelevant to the leading subject
of it, and which, when completed, cannot fail to attract general notice and
admiration.</p>
<p>Every one has heard of the PIRANESI. In the year 1800, PIETRO and FRANCESCO,
the surviving sons of the celebrated GIOVANNI-BATTISTA, transported to France
their immense collection of drawings, with all their plates and engravings.
They were welcomed, protected, and encouraged by the French government. Anxious
to give to these ingenious artists every facility for the success of an
undertaking that they had conceived, it has granted to them the spacious and
handsome premises of the <i>ci-devant Collège de Navarre</i>, in the <i>Rue de
la Montagne St. Geneviève</i>, which the PIRANESI will shortly open as an</p>
<p class="center">ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS.</p>
<p>That ancient college is extremely well calculated for such a destination,
from the extent of its buildings, its remoteness from noise, and the airiness
of its situation. By this liberal conduct to the PIRANESI, the French
government has shewn the warm interest it takes in the progress of those arts.
The establishment of these Romans is to be divided into three branches. The
first is placed in the <i>Collège de Navarre</i>; the second is to be in the
<i>Palais du Tribunat</i>; and the third, at <i>Morfontaine</i>.</p>
<p>Three hundred artists of different nations, some of whom are known by
master-pieces, while others announce the genius necessary for producing them,
are to be distributed in the seven classes of this academy, which include the
fine arts of every description. Each artist being at liberty to follow the
branch to which he is most partial, it may easily be conceived how noble an
emulation will be roused by such an assemblage of talents. Several are now
employed here in the workshops of Painting, Sculpture, Mosaic, and Engraving.
Let us see in what manner.</p>
<p>The ground-floor is devoted to Sculpture. Here are made, in plaster and
terra cotta, models of the finest monuments of Greece and Italy, which are
executed in stone of the richest species, such as porphyry, granite, red
antique, Parian and Carrara marble. From the hands of the two CARDELLI, and
other eminent artists, are seen to issue copies of the most magnificent
bas-reliefs of ancient Rome, and the most beautiful friezes of RAPHAEL, MICHAEL
ANGELO, JULIO ROMANO, and other great masters of the Italian school; tripods,
obelisks, antique vases, articles of furniture in the Egyptian and Chinese
taste, together with objects taken from nature, such as the most curious
animals in the national <i>ménagerie</i>, likewise occupy their talents. All
these subjects are executed in different sizes, and form, together or
separately, decorations for apartments or tables, particularly pilasters, and
plateaux, in which the richness of the materials is surpassed by that of the
workmanship.</p>
<p>On the same floor is the workshop of Mosaic. It is under the direction of
BELLONI, who has invented methods, by means of which he has introduced Mosaic
into articles of furniture, and for the pavement of rich apartments, at prices
far inferior to what might be imagined. The principal articles here exhibited,
as specimens, are:&mdash;1. Superb marble tables and stands, in which are
inserted ornaments and pictures in Mosaic, or incrustated in the Florentine
manner&mdash;2. A large pavement, where the beauty and variety of the marbles
are relieved by embellished incrustations&mdash;3. Small pictures, in which the
painting, in very fine Mosaic, is raised on an even ground of one piece of
black marble&mdash;4. Large tables, composed of specimens of fine-grained
stones, such as jasper, agate, carnelion, lapis lazuli, &amp;c. and also of
valuable marbles, distributed into compartments and after a design imitated
from the antique, and enriched with a few incrustated pictures, representing
animals and flowers. Besides these, here are to be seen other essays of a kind
entirely new. These are marbles, intended for furniture, coloured in an
indelible manner. Sometimes the figures and ornaments in them are coloured in
the ground; sometimes they are in colour, but raised on a ground of white
marble.</p>
<p>On the first story is the workshop for Engraving. Here the artists are
employed in engraving the seven hills of Rome, ancient circuses of that
celebrated city, plans of the <i>forum</i>, obelisks of Rome and Egypt, ruins
of Pompeia, drawn on the spot by the late J. B. PIRANESI, together with modern
subjects, such as the splendid edifices of Paris, the beautiful views of the
environs, the national fêtes, and every thing that can deservedly interest
artists and persons of taste. On the same story are the plates of the PIRANESI
calcography, the place where they are printed, and the warehouse where they are
deposited. The engravings, now nearly executed, will form upwards of twenty
volumes; and those begun will equal that number.</p>
<p>The second story is occupied by painters in oil-colours; the third, by those
in water-colours; the fourth, by draughtsmen in Indian ink and bistre; and the
fifth serves for the lodging of the artists, particularly the most skilful
among them, who direct the different branches of this establishment. The
principal pile of building is crowned by a <i>Belvedere</i>, which commands an
extensive view of Paris, and seems calculated for promoting the inspirations of
genius. Here are copied, in oil, water-colours, Indian ink and bistre, the
fresco paintings of RAPHAEL, MICHAEL ANGELO, and JULIO ROMANO; the Vatican, the
Farnesian palace, the Villa Altoviti, and the Villa Lante alternately
furnishing models no less happily chosen than carefully executed. The
antiquities of Herculaneum, so interesting from the knowledge they afford us of
the customs of the ancient Romans, and from the elegant decorations of which
they have procured us the models, the ruins of Palmyra and Balbeck, those of
Greece and Sicily, together with views of Constantinople and of the country in
which it is situated, are here rendered with the most exact truth, joined to
the most harmonious colouring. Here too are represented; in the three manners
before-mentioned, views and sites of Egypt, Greece, Italy, France, and all
other countries; cascades, such as those of TERNI, NARNI, and TIVOLI;
sea-pieces; landscapes, parks; and gardens; arabesques after RAPHAEL; new and
picturesque plants; in a word, decorations formed of an assemblage of every
thing most perfect in art and nature.</p>
<p>On the first and second stories are also two exhibition-rooms, for such
pictures and works of sculpture as are finished, where the eye wanders
agreeably amidst a crowd of objects of an enlivening or serious nature. Here it
is that the amateur, after having seen the artists at work in the classes of
this academy, fixes his choice on the kind of production which most takes his
fancy. These two rooms contain the different articles which are afterwards to
be displayed in the two porticos of the <i>Palais du Tribunat</i>.</p>
<p>Those elegant and spacious porticos, situated in the most centrical part of
Paris, facing the <i>Rue St. Honoré</i>, have likewise been granted to the
PRIANESI through the special favour of the government.
<a name="let82fr1"></a>Not only all the productions of their establishment, but
also the principal master-pieces in painting, sculpture, and architecture,
produced by artists of all nations, will there be exhibited; so that those
porticos will present, as it were, an Encyclopædia of the Fine
Arts.[<a href="#let82f1">1</a>]
<p class="fnt"><a name="let82f1">Footnote 1</a>: The principal protector of the
undertaking of the PIRANESI is JOSEPH BONAPARTE, who has not confined himself
to assisting them in the capital. Being desirous to introduce the arts into the
country where he passes the finest season of the year, and to promote the
discovery of the PIRANESI, relative to the properties of the argill found at
<i>Morfontaine</i>, he has given to them for several years the use of a large
building and a very extensive piece of ground, ornamented with bowers, where
all the subjects modelled at the <i>Collège de Navarre</i>, in <i>terra
cotta</i> or in porcelain of <i>Morfontaine</i>, undergo the process of baking.
In the last-mentioned place, the PIRANESI purpose to establish a foundery for
sculpture in bronze and other metals. The government daily affords to them
encouragement and resources which insure the success of their establishment. To
its other advantages are added a library, and a
printing-office.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let82fr1">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let83">LETTER LXXXIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 22, 1802.</i></p>
<p>As to the mechanical arts, if you are desirous to view some of the modern
improvements and inventions in that line, you must accompany me to the <i>Rue
St. Martin</i>, where, in the <i>ci-devant</i> priory, is an establishment of
recent date, entitled the</p>
<p class="center">CONSERVATORY OF ARTS AND TRADES.</p>
<p>Here is a numerous collection of machines of every description employed in
the mechanical arts. Among these is the <i>belier hydraulique</i>, newly
invented by MONTGOLFIER, by means of which a stream of water, having a few feet
of declivity, can be raised to the top of a house by a single valve or sucker,
so disposed as to open, to admit the water, and shut, when it is to be raised
by compression. By increasing the compression, it can be raised to 1000 feet,
and may be carried to a much greater elevation. The commissioners appointed by
the Institute to examine this machine, reported that it was new, very simple,
very ingenious, and might be extremely useful in turning to account little
streams of water for the purposes of agriculture, manufactories, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This reminds me of another singular hydraulic machine, of which I have been
informed by a person who attended a trial made of it not long since in
Paris.</p>
<p>A basin placed at the height of twenty feet, was filled with water, the fall
of which set in motion several wheels and pumps that raised the water again
into the basin. The machine was fixed in a place, glazed on all sides, and
locked by three different keys. It kept in play for thirty-two days, without
the smallest interruption; but the air, the heat, and the wood of the machine,
having undoubtedly diminished the water, it no longer ascended into the basin.
Till the thirty-second day, many persons imagined that the perpetual motion had
been discovered. However, this machine was extremely light, well combined, and
very simple in its construction. I ought to observe that it neither acted by
springs nor counterpoise; all its powers proceeding from the fall of the
water.</p>
<p>The conservatory also contains several models of curious buildings, too
numerous to mention.</p>
<p>The mechanical arts in France appear to have experienced more or less the
impulse given to the sciences towards the close of the eighteenth century.
While calamities oppressed this country, and commerce was suspended, the
inventive and fertile genius of the French was not dormant.</p>
<p>The clothiers have introduced woollen articles manufactured on a new plan;
and their fine broad cloths and kerseymeres have attained great perfection. The
introduction of the Spanish merinos into France has already produced in her
wools a considerable amelioration.</p>
<p>Like a ph&oelig;nix, Lyons is reviving from its ashes, and its silks now
surpass, if possible, their former magnificence. Brocaded silk is at present
made in a loom worked by one man only, in lieu of two, which the manufacture of
that article hitherto demanded. Another new invention is a knitting-loom, by
means of which 400 threads are interwoven with the greatest exactness, by
merely turning a winch.</p>
<p>The cotton manufactures are much improved, and the manufactories in that
line are daily increasing in number and perfection. A new spinning-machine has
produced here, I am told, 160,000 ells in length out of a pound of cotton. The
fly-shuttle is now introduced into most of the manufactories in this country,
and 25 pieces of narrow goods are thus made at once by a single workman. In
adopting ARKWRIGHT'S system, the French have applied it to small machines,
which occupy no more room than a common spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>Among other branches in which the French mechanics have particularly
distinguished themselves, since the revolution, is the making of astronomical
and philosophical instruments.</p>
<p>All the machines used here in coining have also been modified and improved.
By one of these, the piece is struck at the same time on the edge and on the
flat side in so perfect a manner, that the money thus coined cannot he
counterfeited.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the invention of a composition which supplies the
place of black lead for pencils, and the discovery of a new and very
expeditious method of tanning leather.</p>
<p>New species of earthen-ware have been invented, and those already known have
received considerable improvement.</p>
<p>Chemists have put the manufacturers in possession of new means of
decomposing and recomposing substances. Muriat of tin is now made here with
such economy, that it is reduced to one-eighth of its former price. This salt
is daily used in dying and in the manufacture of printed calicoes. Carbonates
of strontia and of baryt, obtained by a new process, will shortly be sold in
Paris at 3 francs the <i>kilogramme</i>. This discovery is expected to have a
great influence on several important arts, such as the manufacture of glass, of
soap, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Articles of furniture, jewellery, and every branch dependent on design, are
now remarkable for a purer taste than that which they formerly exhibited.</p>
<p>Indeed, the characteristic difference of the present state of French
industry, and that in which it was before the revolution, is that most of the
proprietors of the manufactories have received a scientific education. At that
time, many of them were strangers to the principles applicable to the processes
of their art; and, in this respect, they lay at the mercy of the routine,
ignorance, and caprice of their workmen. At present, the happy effects of
instruction, more widely-diffused, begin to be felt, and, in proportion as it
is extended, it excites a spirit of emulation which promises no small advantage
to French commerce.</p>
<h2><a name="let84">LETTER LXXXIV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 23, 1802.</i></p>
<p>In the richness of her territory, the abundance of her population, the
activity of her inhabitants, and the knowledge comprised in her bosom, France
possesses great natural advantages; but the effect which they might have
produced on her industry, has been counteracted by the errors of her old
government, and the calamities attendant on the revolution. Some
public-spirited men, thinking the moment favourable for restoring to them all
their influence, have lately met; and from this union has sprung the</p>
<p class="center">SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF NATIONAL INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>It is formed on a scale still more extensive than the <i>Society for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce</i>, instituted at London.
Its meetings are held in the <i>Louvre</i>; but, though fixed in the
metropolis, it embraces the whole extent of the Republic, and every department
will participate in the benefits which it proffers.</p>
<p>The chief objects of this society are: To collect, from all quarters,
discoveries and inventions useful to the progress of the arts; to bestow
annually premiums and gratuitous encouragements; to propagate instruction, by
disseminating manuals on different objects relative to the arts, by combining
the lights of theory with the results of practice, and by constructing at its
own expense, and disseminating among the public in general, and particularly in
the manufactories, such machines, instruments, and apparatus as deserve to be
more generally known and brought into use; to make essays and experiments for
ascertaining the utility which may be expected from new discoveries; to make
advances to artists who may be in distress, or deficient in the means to put in
practice the processes of their inventions; to unite by new ties all such
persons as from their situation in life, their taste, or their talents, feel an
interest in the progress of the arts; to become the centre of similar
institutions, which are called for in all the principal manufacturing-towns of
the Republic; in a word, to <i>excite emulation, diffuse knowledge, and assist
talents</i>.</p>
<p>To attain these objects, various committees, consisting of men the most
conversant in knowledge relative to the arts, are already appointed, and divide
among them <i>gratuitously</i> the whole of the labour.</p>
<p>This society, founded, on principles so purely patriotic, will, no doubt,
essentially second the strenuous efforts of the government to reanimate the
different branches of national industry. The free and spontaneous concurrence
of the men of whom it is composed, may unite the power of opinion to that of
other means; and public opinion produces naturally that which power and
authority obtain only by a slow and difficult progress.</p>
<p>But, while those branches of industry, more immediately connected with the
arts, are stimulated by these simultaneous encouragements, that science, on the
practice of which depends the welfare of States, is not neglected.
Independently of the Council of Agriculture, Commerce and Arts, established
under the presidency of the Minister of the Interior, here is a</p>
<p class="center">FREE SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURE.</p>
<p>Its object is to improve agriculture, not only in the department of La
Seine, but throughout France. For this purpose, it maintains a regular
correspondence with all the agricultural societies of the other departments. It
publishes memoirs, in which are inserted the results of its labours, as well as
the notices and observations read at the meetings by any one of its members,
and the decision which has followed.</p>
<p>Every year it proposes prizes for the solution of some question important to
the amelioration of agriculture.</p>
<p>What, at first view, appears extraordinary, is not, on that account, less
founded on truth. Amidst the storms of the revolution, agriculture has been
improved in France. At a period of happiness and tranquillity, the soil was not
so well cultivated as in times of terror and mourning; because, during the
latter, the lands enjoyed the franchises so long wanted. Hands never failed;
for, when the men marched to the armies, women supplied their place; and no one
was ashamed to handle the spade or the plough.</p>
<p>However, if, in 1789, agriculture in France was far from a state of
prosperity, it was beginning to receive new light from the labours of the
agricultural societies. That of Paris had given a great impulse to the culture
of artificial meadows, potatoes, hemp, flax, and fruit-trees. Practical
directions, spread with profusion in the country, had diverted the inhabitants
from the routine which they had blindly followed from generation to
generation.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the French began to imitate us in gelding their
horses, and giving to their lackies, their coachmen, and their equipages an
English appearance; instead of copying us in the cultivation of our land, and
adopting the principles of our rural economy. This want of foresight they are
now anxious to repair, by increasing their pastures, and enriching them by an
extensive variety of plants, augmenting the number of their cattle, whether
intended for subsistence or reproduction, and improving the breed by a mixture
of races well assorted, procuring a greater quantity of manure, varying their
culture so as not to impoverish the soil, and separating their lands by
inclosures, which obviate the necessity of constantly employing herdsmen to
tend their cattle.</p>
<p>Agriculture has, unquestionably, suffered much, and is still suffering in
the western departments. Notwithstanding the succour afforded by the government
to rebuild and repair the deserted cottages and barns, to supply them with men
and cattle, to set the ploughs to work, and revive industry, it is still
evident that the want of confidence which maintains the value of money at an
exorbitant rate, the love of stock-jobbing, the impossibility of opening small
loans, the excessive price of manual labour, contributions exacted in advance,
and the distress of most of the land-owners, who are not in a condition to shew
favour to their tenants, are scourges which still overwhelm the country. But I
am credibly informed that, in general, the rural inhabitants now lend a more
attentive ear to instruction, and that prejudices have less empire over their
reason. The great landed proprietors, whom terror had induced to fly their
country, have, on recovering possession of their patrimony, converted their
parks into arable land. Others, who are not fond of living in town, are daily
repairing to their estates, in order to superintend the cultivation of them. No
one disdains the simple title of farmer. Old publications relative to
agriculture are reprinted in a form more within reach of the capacity of the
people; though treatises on domestic animals are still much wanted.</p>
<p>At Rambouillet, formerly the country-seat of the duke of Penthièvre, is an
experimental national farm. <a name="let84fr1"></a>Fine cattle are now held in
high estimation. Flocks of sheep of the Spanish breed are daily increasing; and
the number of those of a pure race, already imported, or since bred in France,
exceeds 8000.[<a href="#let84f1">1</a>] Wide roads, which led to one solitary
castle only, have been ploughed, and sown. The rage for ornamental gardens and
pleasure-grounds is dying away. The breeding of horses, a branch of industry
which the war and the requisition had caused to be abandoned, is on the point
of being resumed with increased activity. It is in contemplation to establish
studs, on plans better combined and much more favourable to the object than
those which formerly existed. In short, the ardent wish of the thinking part of
the nation seems to be, that the order which the government is endeavouring to
introduce into every branch of its administration, may determine the labourer
to proportion his hire to the current price of corn; but all these truths
assembled form not such a sketch as you may, perhaps, expect. The state of
French agriculture has never yet been delineated on a comprehensive scale,
except by Arthur Young. <a name="let84fr2"></a>You must persuade him to repeat
his tour, if you wish for a perfect picture.[<a href="#let84f2">2</a>]</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p class="right"><i>March 22, in continuation.</i></p>
<p>Most persons are acquainted with DIDOT'S stereotypic editions of the
classics, &amp;c. which are sold here for 15 <i>sous</i> per copy. Nothing more
simple than the plan of this mode of printing. A page is first set up in
moveable types; a mould or impression is then taken of the page with any
suitable plastic substance, and a solid page is cast from it. The expense of a
solid page exceeds not that of resetting it in moveable types; so that, by this
invention, the price of books will be considerably reduced, and standard works
will never be out of print. Nor are these the only advantages attending the use
of stereotype; I must mention another of still greater importance.</p>
<p>By the common method of printing, it is impossible ever to have correct
books. They are in the market before all their errors are discovered; and the
latest edition of a work, which ought to be the most correct, is necessarily
the most faulty; for it presents not only the errors of that from which it was
copied, but also those peculiar to itself. <a name="let84fr3"></a>Stereotypic
books are printed only to answer the extent of the demand; and errors, when
discovered, being corrected in the metal, they must, through time and
attention, become immaculate; a circumstance of infinite importance in
astronomical and mathematical tables of every
description.[<a href="#let84f3">3</a>]</p>
<p>For elegance of printing, DIDOT is the BENSLEY of Paris; but to see a grand
establishment in this line, you must go to the <i>Rue de la Vrillière</i>, near
the <i>Place des Victoires</i>, and visit the</p>
<p class="center">PRINTING-OFFICE OF THE REPUBLIC.</p>
<p>Under the title of <i>Imprimerie Royale</i>, this establishment vas formerly
placed in the galleries of the <i>Louvre</i>. Instituted by Francis I in 1531,
it was greatly enlarged and improved under Lewis XIII and Lewis XIV. It has
also been considerably augmented since its removal, in 1791, to the hotel
belonging to the late Duke of Penthièvre, which it now occupies.</p>
<p>In its present state, it may be considered as the most extensive and most
complete typographical establishment in being. Every branch relating to
typography, from the casting of the type to the article of binding, is here
united. The <i>dépôt</i> of punches contains upwards of 30,000 characters of
all languages. Among others, here are to be remarked, in all their primitive
purity, the beautiful Greek ones of Garamon, engraved by order of Francis I,
and which served for the editions of the Stephen, the Byzantine, &amp;c, the
oriental characters of the Polyglot of Vitræus, and the collection of exotic
characters from the printing-office of the Propaganda. The government business
alone constantly employs one hundred presses. A much greater number can be set
to work, if wanted.</p>
<p>Independently of the works concerning administration and the sciences, which
are executed here at the public cost, the government allows authors to cause to
be printed at this office, at their own private expense, such works as, on
account of their importance, the difficulty of execution, and the particular
types which they require, are entitled to that favour.</p>
<p>On applying to the director, the amateurs of typography are instantly
admitted to view this establishment, and shewn every thing interesting in it,
with that spirit of liberality which is extended to every public institution
here, and which reflects the highest honour on the French nation.</p>

<p class="fnt"><a name="let84f3">Footnote 3</a>: It is, however, to be remarked
that the merit of this invaluable invention is not due to France, but to
Britain. As far back as the year 1725, a Mr. GED, of Edinburgh, turned his
thoughts to the formation of cast letter-press plates, and, in 1736, printed a
stereotype edition of Sallust. Being opposed by a combination of printers and
booksellers, whose ignorance and prejudices he was unable to overcome, he
relinquished the prosecution of his discovery; and thus the stereotypic art was
lost to the world, till rediscovered, in 1780, by Mr. ALEXANDER TILLOCH. In the
year 1783, Mr. TILLOCH took out a patent for it, in conjunction with Mr.
FOULIS, then printer to the University of Glasgow. They printed several books
in this manner; but it seems that they also experienced an opposition from the
booksellers, and, owing to different circumstances, have not since availed
themselves of their patent. Notwithstanding this evidence of priority, the
French dispute the invention; and the learned CAMUS, in his "<i>Historical
Sketch of Polytypage and Stereotypage</i>," affirms, on the authority of
LOTTIN, that, towards the end of the seventeenth century, the stereotypic
process was put in practice in France, for printing the calendars prefixed to
the missals. Hence it is seen that the claim of the English is supported by
positive proof; while that of the French rests on bare
assertion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#let84fr3">Return to text</a></p>
<h2><a name="let85">LETTER LXXXV.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March</i> 26, 1802.</p>
<p>In visiting a foreign country, and more especially its capital, the
traveller, whose object is instruction, enters into the most minute details, in
order to obtain a complete knowledge of the various classes of its inhabitants.
As Seneca justly observes, in his epistles, what benefit can a person reap from
his travels, who spends all his time in examining the beauty and magnificence
of public buildings? Will the contemplation of them render him more wise, more
temperate, more liberal in his ideas? Will it remove his prejudices and errors?
It may amuse him for a time, as a child, by the novelty and variety of objects,
which excite an unmeaning admiration. To act thus, adds the learned stoic, is
not to travel, it is to wander, and lose both one's time and labour.</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Non est hoc peregrinari, sed erraie</i>."</p>
<p>Wherefore Horace, in imitation of Homer, says, in praise of Ulysses,</p>
<p class="bq">"<i>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, et urbes</i>."</p>
<p>I have, I hope, given you enough of sights and shows; let us then, my good
friend, follow the wise example of the ancients, and take a view of men and
manners.</p>
<p>Owing, in some measure, to the levity of French character, and the freedom
which now prevails generally enough in all society here, this sort of study,
sometimes so tedious, is greatly facilitated. In the Parisian assemblies of the
present day, by an almost continual collision, self-love discovers the weak
side of an individual whose whole merit consists in a little small-talk, and a
rotation of those <i>jolis petits riens</i>, which, seconded by a well-favoured
countenance and an agreeable carriage, have given him in the world the
reputation of an amiable man; while, from another, we see a thousand essential
qualities, concealed under a coarse exterior, force themselves into notice, and
which his modesty, or more frequently his timidity, prevented him from
displaying.</p>
<p>From the preceding preamble, you will naturally conclude that I purpose to
appropriate this letter to a few remarks on the</p>
<p class="center">PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY IN PARIS.</p>
<p>In this city are three very distinct kinds of society. But the order I shall
adopt in the description of each of them must not, in any way, lead you to
prejudge my opinion respecting the rank which they hold among the French
themselves. In this respect, I shall abstain from every sort of reflection,
and, confining myself to the simple character of a faithful narrator, shall
leave to your sagacity to decide the question.</p>
<p>I shall begin by the society, chiefly composed of the <i>ci-devant
noblesse</i>, several of whom, never having quitted France, have preserved some
of their property; and of emigrants, lately returned to their own country, and
who have enough remaining to allow them to have a household establishment, but
in a very modest style indeed, compared to that which their rank and fortune
enabled them to support before the revolution.</p>
<p>You present yourself at the residence of <i>Madame la Marquise de C----</i>.
In the anti-room, you declare your name and quality to the groom of the
chambers. Then, the opening of one or two folding-doors announces to the
mistress of the house, and to the company, the <i>quantum</i> of the ceremonies
which are to be paid to the newcomer. Keep your eye constantly on the
<i>Marquise</i>, her behaviour will regulate yours in regard to the individuals
who compose her party. In the course of conversation, take special care not to
omit the title of the person to whom you address yourself. Such an instance of
forgetfulness savours of a man of the new <i>régime</i>. Never pronounce the
new denominations respecting the divisions of the French territory, the months,
the weights, measures, &amp;c. Those words would draw on you an unfavourable
interpretation. If you are inclined to hear a discussion on the arts and
sciences, or on any new discovery whatever, you seldom find, in these parties,
persons who can gratify your taste; though you may meet with many who, as Locke
says, "know a little, presume a great deal, and so jump to a conclusion."</p>
<p>From the plebeians, whose presence the <i>ci-devant</i> nobles are so
condescending as to endure, much obsequiousness and servility are required; and
it is expected that the distance of rank should never be forgotten. But the
learned or scientific French revolutionist, who admits no other distance than
that between knowledge and ignorance, not choosing to submit to such
conditions, seldom presents himself at the house of <i>Madame la Marquise de
C----</i>. However, you will hear her company speak of the court of France, of
the interest which each individual had there, and also a few anecdotes not
uninteresting, and which will furnish you with some ideas of the brilliant
parties there formed. After this discussion, one will talk to you of his
regiment; another, of his hunting establishment, of his <i>châteaux</i>, of his
estates, &amp;c. <i>Chez Madame la Marquise de C----</i>, you will find no
inconsiderable prepossession against every thing that is not of the old order
of things, and even some exclusive pretensions to manners which belong to those
only who are real gentlemen. Yet, through all these absurdities, you will
always see good-breeding prevail in this society, and the disposition which
distinguishes a Frenchman from other polished nations, will here break forth
and present itself to you in a striking manner.</p>
<p>While speaking of the <i>ci-devant noblesse</i>, I cannot forbear to mention
the loss which those who had the happiness of her acquaintance, have sustained
by the recent death of Madame DE CHOISEUL, the relict of the duke of that name,
minister to Lewis XV. Her virtues shed such a lustre round her, that it reached
even the monarch himself, who, when he banished her husband to Chanteloup,
wrote to him: "I should have sent you much further, but for the particular
esteem I have for Madame DE CHOISEUL, in whose health I take no small
interest." This uncommonly-respectable woman will long be quoted and deservedly
regretted, because she was modest in greatness, beneficent in prosperity,
courageous in misfortune, pure in the vortex of corruption, solid in the midst
of frivolity, as simple in her language as she was brilliant in her
understanding, and as indulgent to others as she was superior to them in grace
and virtue.</p>
<p>I shall next lead you to the house of a <i>parvenu</i>, that is, one of
those, who, from having made some successful speculations, and possessing a
conscience not overnice as to the means of fixing Fortune, is enabled to live
in the expensive style of the <i>ci-devant</i> court-lords and farmers-general.
A letter changed in the person's name, not unfrequently a <i>de</i> or a
<i>St.</i> added, (sometimes both) puzzles the curious, who endeavour to
discover what was formerly M. <i>de St. H------</i>, now in the enjoyment of an
annual income of a hundred thousand francs, or £4000 sterling.</p>
<p>At his house, more than any where else, etiquette is kept up with an
extraordinary minuteness; and evil tongues will tell you that it is natural for
M. <i>de St. H------</i> to remember and avail himself of the observations
which he had it in his power to make in the place he formerly occupied. Under
his roof, you will find little of that ease and amiableness which are to be
remarked in the other societies of Paris. Each individual is on his guard, and
afraid of betraying himself by certain expressions, which the force of habit
has not yet allowed him to forget. But if you are fond of good music, if you
take a pleasure in balls, and in the company of <i>femmes galantes</i> or
demireps; and even if first-rate jugglers, ventriloquists, and mimics amuse you
by their skilful performances, frequent the house of M. <i>de St. H------</i>,
and every day, or at least every day that he is at home, you will have a new
entertainment.</p>
<p>Between the acts, the company make their remarks, each in his own way, on
what they have just seen or heard. Afterwards, the conversation turns on the
public funds. Little is said, however, on affairs of State, the bankruptcies of
the day, and the profit which such or such a speculation might produce. The
ladies, after having exhausted the subject of the toilet, finish by giving, as
an apology for their own conduct, the charitable enumeration of the
peccadilloes which they fancy they have remarked in other women.</p>
<p>So little am I disposed for gaming, that I forgot to mention
<i>bouillotte</i>, <i>quinze</i>, and also whist and reversi, which are
introduced at all these parties. But the two last-mentioned games are reserved
for those only who seek in cards nothing more than a recreation from the
occupations of the day. At the others, gain is the sole object of the player;
and many persons sit at the gaming-table the whole night, and, in the depth of
winter even, never leave it till the "garish sun" warns them that it is time to
withdraw.</p>
<p>I have now only to introduce you at M. <i>B------'s</i>, Counsellor of
State. Here you will find the completion of the other two societies, and a very
numerous party, which affords to every one a conversation analogous to his
taste or his means. Refrain, however, from touching on politics; the French
government, still in its infancy, resembles a young plant exposed to the
inclemency of the air, and whose growth is directed by skilful hands. This
government must remove, and even sometimes destroy every obstacle it meets
with, and which may be prejudicial to the form and direction that it thinks
proper to give to its branches and various ramifications. Beware, above all, of
speaking of the revolution. That string is too delicate to be touched in regard
to certain individuals of M. <i>B------'s</i> party, perhaps also in regard to
himself: for the periods of the calamities which the French have undergone are
still quite recent, and the parts that many of these persons may have acted,
call to mind recollections too painful, which, for their tranquillity, ought
ever to be buried in oblivion. And, in fact, you will always perceive, in the
meetings of this class, a harmony, apparent indeed, but which, surprises a
stranger the more, as, of all the societies in Paris, it presents to him the
greatest medley in point of the persons who compose it.</p>
<p>In this society you will hear very instructive dissertations on the
sciences, sound literature, the fine arts, mechanics, and the means of
rendering useful the new discoveries, by applying them with economy to the
French manufactories, either public or private: for M. <i>B------</i> considers
it as his duty to receive with distinction all the <i>savans</i>, and generally
all those called men of talent. In this line of conduct, he follows the example
set him by the government; and every one is desirous to appear a Mæcenas in the
eyes of Augustus. In other respects, the house of M. <i>B------</i> will afford
you the agreeble pastimes which you have found at M. <i>de St.
H------'s</i>.</p>
<p>In Paris, however, are several other societies which, to consider them
rightly, are no more than a diminutive of those you have just left; but which,
nevertheless, are of a character sufficiently distinct in their composition to
justify their pretensions to be classed as well as the others. This difference
proceeding chiefly from that of political opinions alone, an acquaintance with
the great societies here will enable you to select those of the middle class
which you may think proper to frequent, according to your taste, or your manner
of seeing and judging of the events of the French revolution. Yet, you must not
hence conclude that the conversation turns chiefly on that subject in this
particular class of the Parisian societies. They concern themselves less about
it perhaps than the others, whether from the little share they have had in it,
or because they have but very indirect connexions with the government, or
lastly, and this final reason is, I believe, the most conclusive, because a
Frenchman, from the nature of his character, ends by forgetting his misfortunes
and losses, cares little for the future, and appears desirous to enjoy the
present only; following, in that respect, the precept of La Fontaine:</p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Jouis dès aujourd'hui, tu n'as pas tant à vivre;<br />
Je te rebàts ce mot&mdash;car il vaut tout un livre."</i></p>
<p>In truth, although, among this people, vexations and enjoyments are almost
always the result of imagination, they have preserved the remembrance of their
misfortunes only to turn to account the terrible lessons which they have
received from them, by adopting, in regard to the present and to the future,
that happy philosophy which knows how to yield to the circumstances of the
moment. This it is (you may rely on the fact) that has contributed, more than
any other cause, to re-establish, in so short a period, the order and
tranquillity which France presents to the eyes of astonished foreigners. This
it is too that has, in a great measure, obviated the fatal consequences which
their past troubles must have made them fear for a long time to come, and for
which few remedies could be expected, especially when we reflect on the
divisions which the revolution has sown in almost every family in this
country.</p>
<p>P. S. The sound of cannon, which strikes my ear at this moment, announces
the signature of the definitve treaty. In the evening, a grand illumination
will take place to celebrate the return of the most desirable of all
blessings.</p>
<p class="bq">"------------O beauteous Peace!<br />
Sweet union of a State! What else but thou<br />
Giv'st safety, strength, and glory to a people?"</p>
<h2><a class="let86">LETTER LXXXVI.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 28, 1802.</i></p>
<p>Whatever changes may have been introduced by the revolution, in one respect
at least, the Parisians still preserve towards foreigners that urbanity for
which they were remarkable half a century ago, when Sterne paid them a visit.
If you ask a shopkeeper here, of either sex, the way to a place, perhaps at
some distance, he or she neglects the occupation of the moment to direct you,
with as much solicitude and attention as though a considerable advantage was to
be the result of the given information. It is the small sweet courtesies of
life, as that sentimental traveller remarks, which render the road of it less
rugged.</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, a foreigner pays dearly for the civility shewn him in
Paris; but, in laying out his money, he must ever bear in mind that the
shopkeepers make no scruple to overcharge their articles to their own
countrymen, and some will not blush to take, even from them, a third less than
the price demanded.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival here, I think I mentioned to you the excessive
dearness of</p>
<p class="center">FURNISHED LODGINGS.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, their price is nearly doubled, and is extremely high
in the most fashionable parts of the town, such as the <i>Chaussée d'Antin</i>,
the <i>Rue de la Loi</i>, the <i>Rue de la Concorde</i>, &amp;c. For strangers
that know not in Paris any friend who will take the trouble to seek for them
suitable apartments, the only way to procure good accommodation is to alight at
a ready-furnished hotel, and there hire rooms by the day till they can look
about them, and please themselves. </p>
<p>For my own part, I prefer the quiet of a private lodging to the bustle of a
public hotel, and, as I have before mentioned, my constant resource, on such
occasions, has been the <i>Petites Affiches</i>. If you go to the office where
this Daily Advertiser is published, and inspect the file, it is ten to one that
you immediately find apartments to your wishes.</p>
<p>A single man may now be comfortably lodged here, in a private house with a
<i>porte-cochère</i>, at from 5 to 8 louis per month; and a small family may be
well accommodated, in that respect, at from 12 to 16 louis. A larger party,
requiring more room, may obtain excellent apartments at from 20 louis a month
upwards, according to the situation, the conveniences, the taste and condition
of the furniture, and other contingencies. To prevent subsequent
misunderstanding, I would always recommend a written agreement.</p>
<p>The English have hitherto paid dearer than other foreigners for whatever
they want in Paris, because they generally trust to their servants, and think
it beneath them to look into those matters connected with their own comfort.
But the <i>Milords Anglais</i> are now entirely eclipsed by the Russian Counts,
who give two louis where the English offer one. A person's expenses here, as
every where else, materially depend on good management, without which a
thoughtless man squanders twice as much as a more considerate one; and while
the former obtains no more than the common comforts of life, the latter enjoys
all its indulgences.</p>
<p>With respect to the gratifications of the table, I have little to add to
what I have already said on that subject, in speaking of the
<i>restaurateurs</i>. If you choose to become a boarder, you may subscribe at
the <i>Hôtel du Cirque</i>, <i>Rue de la Loi</i>, and sit down every day in
good company for about seven louis a month; and there are very respectable
private houses, where you may, when once introduced, dine very well for five
livres a time; but, at all these places, you are sure to meet either English or
Americans; and the consequence is, that you are eternally speaking your
mother-tongue, which is a material objection with those who are anxious to
improve themselves in the French language. For a man who brings his family to
Paris, and resides in private apartments, it might, perhaps, be more advisable
to hire a cook, and live <i>à l'Anglaise</i> or <i>à la Française</i>,
according to his fancy.</p>
<p>No conveniences have been so much improved in Paris, since the revolution,
as</p>
<p class="center">JOB AND HACKNEY CARRIAGES.</p>
<p>Formerly, the <i>remises</i> or job-carriages were far inferior to those in
use at the present day; and the old <i>fiacres</i> or hackney-coaches were
infamous. The carriages themselves were filthy; the horses, wretched; and the
coachmen, in tatters, had more the look of beggars than that of drivers.</p>
<p>Now, not only good hackney-coaches, but chariots and cabriolets likewise,
figure here on the stands; and many of them have an appearance so creditable
that they might even be taken for private French equipages.
<a name="let86fr1"></a>The regular stipulated fare of all these vehicles is at
present 30 <i>sous</i> a <i>course</i>, and the same for every hour after the
first, which is fixed at 40 <i>sous</i>.[<a href="#let86f1">1</a>] In 1789, it
used to be no more than 24. For the 30 <i>sous</i>, you may drive from one
extremity of Paris to the other, provided you do not stop by the way; for every
voluntary stoppage is reckoned a <i>course</i>. However, if you have far to go,
it is better to agree to pay 40 <i>sous</i> per hour, and then you meet with no
contradiction. From midnight to six o'clock in the morning, the fare is
double.</p>
<p>The present expense of a job-carriage, with a good pair of horses,
(including the coachman, who is always paid by the jobman) varies from 22 to 24
louis a month, according to the price of forage. If you use your own carriage,
the hire of horses and coachman will cost you from 12 to 15 louis, which, in
1789, was the price of a job-carriage, all expenses included.</p>
<p><a name="let86fr2"></a>Under the old <i>régime</i>, there were no stands of
cabriolets.[<a href="#let86f2">2</a>] These carriages are very convenient to
persons pressed for time; but it must be confessed that they are no small
annoyance to pedestrians. Of this Lewis XV was so convinced, that he declared
if he were Minister of the Police, he would suffer no cabriolets in Paris. He
thought this prohibition beneath his own greatness. To obviate, in some
measure, the danger arising both from the want of foot-pavement, and from the
inconsiderate rapidity with which these carriages are not unfrequently driven,
it is now a law that the neck of every horse in a cabriolet must be provided
with bells, and the carriage with two lamps, lighted after dark; yet, in spite
of these precautions, and the severity which the police exercises against those
who transgress the decree, serious accidents sometimes happen.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, "<i>gare! gare!</i>" was the only warning given here
to foot-passengers. The master, in his cabriolet, first drove over a person,
the servant behind then bawled out "<i>gare!</i>" and the maimed pedestrian was
left to get up again as he was able. Such brutal negligence now meets with due
chastisement.</p>
<p>At a trial which took place here the other day in a court of justice, the
driver of a cabriolet was condemned to three months imprisonment in a house of
correction, and to pay a fine of 100 francs for maiming a carter. The horse had
no bells, as prescribed by law; and the owner of the cabriolet was, besides,
condemned, in conjunction with the driver, to pay an indemnification of 3000
francs to the wounded carter, as being civilly responsible for the conduct of
his servant.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the danger of walking in the streets of Paris, such French
women as are accustomed to go on foot, traverse the most frequented
thoroughfares in the dirtiest weather, at the same time displaying, to the
astonished sight of bespattered foreigners, a well-turned leg, a graceful step,
and spotless stockings.</p>
<p>If you arrive in Paris without a servant, or (what amounts almost to the
same thing) should you bring with you a man ignorant of the French language,
you may be instantly accommodated with one or several domestics, under the name
of</p>
<p class="center">VALETS-DE-PLACE.</p>
<p>Like every thing else here, the wages of these job-servants are augmented.
Formerly, their salary was 30 or 40 <i>sous</i> a day: they now ask 4 francs;
but, if you purpose to spend a few weeks here, will be glad to serve you for 3.
Some are very intelligent; others, very stupid. Most of them are spies of the
police; but, as an Englishman in Paris has nothing to conceal, of what
consequence is it whether his steps are watched by his own
<i>valet-de-place</i> or any other <i>mouchard?</i> It is usual for them to lay
under contribution all the tradesmen you employ; and thus the traiteur, the
jobman, &amp;c. contribute to augment their profits. However, if they pilfer
you a little themselves, they take care that you are not subjected to too much
imposition from others.&mdash;To proceed to a few</p>
<p class="center">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>In visiting the French capital, many Englishmen are led into an error. They
imagine that a few letters of recommendation will be the means of procuring
them admission into other houses besides those of the persons to whom these
letters are addressed. But, on their arrival in Paris, they will find
themselves mistaken. The houses of the <i>great</i> are difficult of access,
and those of the secondary class scarcely open with more ease than they did
before the revolution. If proper attention be paid to all the letters which a
stranger brings, he may be satisfied; though the persons to whom he is
recommended, seldom think of taking him to the residence of any of their
friends. Therefore, an English traveller, who wishes to mix much in French
society, should provide himself with as many letters of recommendation as he
can possibly obtain; unless, indeed, he has a celebrated name, which, in all
countries, is the best introduction; for curiosity prompts the higher classes
to see and examine the man who bears it. The doors of every house will be open
to him, when they are shut against other strangers, and he may soon establish
an intimacy in the first circles. To those who possess not that advantage, a
Frenchman may be induced to offer a dinner, or two, perhaps, and return them a
few formal visits. He will profess more than he performs. In a word, he will be
polite, but not familiar and friendly.</p>
<p>An Englishman, thus circumstanced, finding that he gains no ground, and is
treated with a sort of ceremony, will probably seek other company, dine at the
<i>restaurateurs'</i>, frequent the <i>spectacles</i>, and visit the impures:
for such was the life our countrymen, in general, led in Paris before the
revolution. Public amusements may, perhaps, make him amends for the want of
private society. As, from their astonishing number, they may be varied without
end, he may contrive to pass away his evenings. His mornings will, at first, be
employed, no doubt, in visiting public curiosities; but, after he has
repeatedly surveyed these scenes of attraction, he will fail in what ought to
be the grand object of foreign travel, and return home without having acquired
a competent knowledge of the manners of the country. He ought therefore to
husband proper French acquaintances, and keep up a constant intercourse with
them, or he will run a risk of finding himself insulated. Should indisposition
confine him to the house for a few days, every one to whom he has been
recommended, will suppose him gone, he will no longer be thought of;
<i>ennui</i> will take possession of him, and, cursing France, he will wish
himself safely landed on the shore of Old England.</p>
<p>If this is the case with an Englishman who brings letters to Paris, what
must be the situation of one who visits this capital entirely unprovided in
that respect? The banker on whom he has a letter of credit, may invite him to a
dinner, at which are assembled twenty persons, to all of whom he is a perfect
stranger. Without friends, without acquaintances, he will find himself like a
man dropped from the clouds, amidst six or seven hundred thousand persons,
driving or walking about in pursuit of their affairs or pleasures. For want of
a proper clue to direct him, he is continually in danger of falling into the
most detestable company; and the temptations to pleasure are so numerous and so
inviting in this gay city, that it requires more fortitude than falls to the
lot of many to resist them. Consequently, an untravelled foreigner cannot be
too much on his guard in Paris; for it will require every exertion of his
prudence and discrimination to avoid being duped and cheated. Above all, he
should shun those insinuating and subtle characters who, dexterous in
administering that delicious essence which mixes so sweetly with the blood, are
ever ready to shew him the curiosities, and introduce him into coteries, which
they will represent as respectable, and in which the mistress of the house and
her daughters will, probably, conspire to lighten his pocket, and afterwards
laugh at his credulity.</p>
<p>As to the reception which the English are likely to meet with here after the
ratification of the definitive treaty, (if I may be permitted to judge from
personal experience and observation) I think it will, in a great measure,
depend on themselves. Therefore, should any of our countrymen complain of being
treated here with less attention now than before the revolution, it will, on
candid investigation, prove to be their own fault. The essential difference
will be found to consist in the respect paid to the man, not, as formerly, in
proportion to his money, but to his social worth. The French seem now to make a
distinction between individuals only, not between nations. Whence it results
that, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, the foreigner who possesses most the talent of
making himself agreeable in society, will here be the most welcome. Not but, in
general, they will shew greater indulgence to an Englishman, and be inclined to
overlook in him that which they would consider as highly unpardonable in a
stranger of any other country.</p>
<p>On such occasions, their most usual exclamation is "<i>Les Anglais sont des
gens bien extraordinaires! Ma foi! ils sont inconcevables</i>!" And, indeed,
many Englishmen appear to glory in justifying the idea, and <i>astonishing the
natives</i> by the eccentricity of their behaviour. But these <i>originals</i>
should recollect that what may be tolerated in a man of superior talent, is
ridiculous, if not contemptible, in one undistinguished by such a pretension;
and that, by thus <i>posting</i> their absurdities to the eyes of a foreign
nation, they leave behind them an impression which operates as a real injury in
regard to their more rational countrymen. Another circumstance deserves no less
animadversion.</p>
<p>In their first essay of foreign travel, our British youths generally carry
with them too ample a share of national prepossession and presumption.
Accustomed at home to bear down all before them by the weight of their purse,
they are too apt to imagine that, by means of a plentiful provision of gold,
they may lord it over the continent, from Naples to Petersburg; and that a
profuse expenditure of money supersedes the necessity of a compliance with
established forms and regulations. Instead of making their applications and
inquiries in a proper manner, so as to claim due attention, they more
frequently demand as a right what they should rather receive as a favour.
Finding themselves disappointed in their vain conclusions, their temper is
soured; and, being too proud to retract their error, or even observe a prudent
silence, they deal out their impertinence and abuse in proportion to the number
of guineas which they may be able to squander. Of course, they cannot but view
the peculiar habits and customs of all foreign nations with a jaundiced eye,
never reflecting that in most countries are to be found, either in a moral or a
physical sense, advantages and disadvantages in which others are deficient.
<i>Le</i> POUR <i>et le</i> CONTRE, as a well-known traveller observes, <i>se
trouvent en chaque nation</i>. The grand desideratum is to acquire by travel a
knowledge of this POUR <i>et</i> CONTRE, which, by emancipating us from our
prejudices, teaches us mutual toleration&mdash;for, of every species of
tyranny, that which is exercised on things indifferent in themselves, is the
most intolerable. Hence it is less difficult to deprive a nation of its laws
than to change its habits.</p>

<h2><a name="let87">LETTER LXXXVII</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, March 31, 1802.</i></p>
<p>If I mistake not, I have answered most of the questions contained in your
letters; I shall now reply to you on the subject of</p>
<p class="center">DIVORCE.</p>
<p>The number of divorced women to be met with here, especially among the more
affluent classes, exceeds any moderate calculation. Nothing can more clearly
manifest the necessity of erecting some dike against the torrent of immorality,
which has almost inundated this capital, and threatens to spread over all the
departments.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, the indissolubility of marriage in France was
supposed to promote adultery in a very great degree: the vow was broken because
the knot could not be untied. At present, divorces are so easily obtained, that
a man or woman, tired of each other, have only to plead <i>incompatibility of
temper</i>, in order to slip their necks out of the matrimonial noose. In
short, some persons here change their wedded partner with as much unconcern as
they do their linen. Thus, the two extremes touch each other; and either of
them has proved equally pernicious to morals.</p>
<p>Formerly, if a Frenchman kept a watchful eye on his wife, he was reckoned
jealous, and was blamed. If he adopted a contrary conduct, and she was
faithless, he was ridiculed. Not unfrequently, a young miss, emerged from the
cloisters of a convent, where she had, perhaps, been sequestered, in order that
her bloom might not eclipse the declining charms of her mother, and who
appeared timid, bashful, and diffident, was no sooner married to a man in a
certain rank in life, than she shone as a meteor of extravagance and
dissipation. Such a wife thought of nothing but the gratification of her own
desires; because she considered it as a matter of course that all the cares of
the family ought to devolve by right on the husband. Provided she could procure
the means of satisfying her taste for dress, and of making a figure in the
<i>beau monde</i>, no other concerns ever disturbed her imagination. If, at
first, she had sufficient resolution to resist the contagion of example, and
not take a male friend to her bosom, by way of lightening the weight of her
connubial chains, she seldom failed, in the end, to follow the fashion of the
day, and frequent the gaming-table, where her virtue was sacrificed to
discharge her debts of honour.</p>
<p>But what have these <i>would-be</i> republicans to allege as an excuse in
their favour? They have no convents to initiate young girls in the arts of
dissimulation; no debauched court to contaminate, by its example, the wavering
principles of the weak part of the sex, or sap the more determined ones of
those whose mind is of a firmer texture; nor have they any friendly,
sympathizing confessors to draw a spunge, as it were, over the trespasses hid
in a snug corner of their heart. No: every one is left to settle his own
account with heaven. Yet the libertinism which at present reigns in Paris is
sufficient to make a deep impression on persons the least given to
reflection.</p>
<p><i>Il matrimonio</i>, says the Italian proverb, <i>è un paradiso o un
inferno</i>. In fact, nothing can be compared to the happiness of a married
couple, united by sympathy. To them, marriage is really a terrestrial paradise.
But what more horrid than the reverse, that is, two beings cursing the fatal
hour which brought them together in wedlock? It is a very hell on earth; for
surely no punishment can exceed that of being condemned to pass our days with
the object of our detestation.</p>
<p>If the indissolubility of marriage in France was formerly productive of such
bad consequences; now that the nuptial knot can be loosened with so much
facility, there can no longer exist the same plea for adultery. Is then this
accumulation of vice less the effect of the institution of divorce in itself,
than that of the undigested law by which it was first introduced?</p>
<p>The law of divorce was, I find, projected in 1790, under the auspices of the
last Duke of Orleans, who, utterly regardless of the welfare of the State,
wished to revolutionize every thing, solely with a view to his own individual
interest. His object was to get rid of his wife, who was a woman of strict
virtue. This law was decreed on the 20th of September 1792, without any
discussion whatever. On the 8th of Nivôse and 4th of Floréal, year II, (29th of
December 1794 and 24th of April 1795) the Convention decreed additional laws,
all tending to favour the impetuosity of the passions. Thus the door was opened
still wider to licentiousness and debauchery. By these laws, an absence of six
months is sufficient for procuring a divorce, and, after the observance of
certain forms, either of the parties may contract a fresh marriage.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to conceive how many hot-headed, profligate,
unprincipled persons, of both sexes, have availed themselves of such laws to
gratify their unruly passions, their resentment, their avarice, or their
ambition. Oaths, persons, or property, are, in these cases, little respected.
If a libertine finds that he cannot possess the object of his desires on any
other terms, like Sir John Brute, in the play, he marries her, in order to go
to bed to her, and in a few days sues for a divorce. I have been shewn here a
Lothario of this description, who, in the course of a short space of time had
been married to no less than six different women.</p>
<p>"Divorce," says a judicious French writer, "is a separation, the necessity
for which ought to be supported by unquestionable proofs; otherwise, it is
nothing more than a legitimate scandal."</p>
<p>The French often wish to assimilate themselves to the Romans, and the Roman
laws sanctioned divorce. Let us then examine how far the comparison can, in
this respect, be supported.</p>
<p>"Among the Romans," continues he, "the first who availed himself of this
privilege was Spurius Corbilius, because his wife was steril. The second
divorce was that of C. Sulpicius, because his wife had gone abroad with her
hair uncovered, and without a veil over her head. Q. Anstitius divorced on
account of having seen his wife speak to a person of her own sex, who was
reckoned loose in her conduct; and Sempronius, because his had been to see the
public entertainments without having informed him. These different divorces
took place about a hundred years after the foundation of Rome. The Romans,
after that, were upwards of five hundred years without affording an instance of
any divorce. They then were moral and virtuous. But, at length, luxury, that
scourge of societies, corrupted their hearts; and divorces became so frequent,
that many women reckoned their age by the number of their husbands." To this he
might have added, that several Roman ladies of rank were so lost to all sense
of shame, that they publicly entered their names among the licensed
prostitutes.</p>
<p>"Marriage," concludes he, "presently became nothing more than an object of
commerce and speculation; and divorce, a tacit permission for libertinism. Can
divorce among the French, be considered otherwise, when we reflect that this
institution, which seemed likely to draw closer the conjugal tie, by restoring
it to its state of natural liberty, is, through the abuse made of it, now only
a mean of shameful traffic, in which the more cunning of the two ruins the
ether, in short, a mound the less against the irruptions of immorality?"</p>
<p>So much for the opinion of a French writer of estimation on the effect of
these laws: let us at present endeavour to illustrate it by some examples.</p>
<p>A young lady, seduced by a married man, found herself pregnant. She was of a
respectable family: he was rich, and felt the consequences of this event. What
was to be done? He goes to one of his friends, whom he knew not to be
overburdened with delicacy, and proposes to him to marry this young person, in
consideration of a certain sum of money. The friend consents, and the only
question is to settle the conditions. They bargain for some time: at last they
agree for 10,000 francs (<i>circa</i> £410 sterling). The marriage is
concluded, the lady is brought to bed, the child dies, and the gentleman sues
for a divorce. All this was accomplished in six months. As such opportunities
are by no means scarce, he may, in the course of the year, probably, meet with
another of the same nature: thus the office of bridegroom is converted into a
lucrative situation. The following is another instance of this melancholy
truth, but of a different description.</p>
<p>A man about thirty-two years of age, well-made, and of a very agreeable
countenance, had been married three months to a young woman of uncommon beauty.
He was loved, nay almost adored by her. Every one might have concluded that
they were the happiest couple in Paris; and, in fact, no cloud had hitherto
overshadowed the serenity of their union. One day when the young bride was at
table with her husband, indulging herself in expressing the happiness which she
enjoyed, a tipstaff entered, and delivered to her a paper. She read it. What
should it be but a subp&oelig;na for a divorce? At first she took the thing for
a pleasantry: but the husband soon convinced her that nothing was more serious.
He assured her that this step would make her fortune, and his own too, if she
would consent to the arrangement which he had to propose to her. "You know,"
said he, "the rich and ugly Madame C----: she has 30,000 francs a year (circa
£1250 sterling); she will secure to me the half of her property, provided I
will marry her. I offer you a third, if, after having willingly consented to
our divorce, you will permit me to see you as my female friend." Such a
proposal shocked her at the moment; but a week's reflection effected a change
in her sentiments; and the business was completed. <i>O tempora! O
mores!</i></p>
<p>But though many married individuals still continue to break their chains, it
appears that divorces are gradually decreasing in number; and should the
government succeed in introducing into the law on this subject the necessary
modifications, of course they will become far less frequent.</p>
<p>Every legislature must be aware to what a degree plays are capable of
influencing the opinions of a nation, and what a powerful spring they are for
moving the affections. Why then are not theatrical representations here so
regulated, that the stage may conduce to the amelioration of morals? Instead of
this, in most French comedies, the husband is generally made the butt of
ridicule, and the whole plot often lies in his being outwitted by some
conceited spark. Marriage, in short, is incessantly railed at in such a lively,
satirical manner as to delight nine-tenths of the audience.</p>
<p>This custom was also introduced on our stage under the reign of Charles II;
and, not many years ago, it was, I am told, as usual to play <i>The London
Cuckolds</i> on Lord Mayor's day, as it is now to give a representation of
<i>George Barnwell</i> during the Easter holidays. Yet, what is this practice
of exhibiting a cuckold in a ridiculous point of view, but an apology for
adultery, as if it was intended to teach women that their charms are not formed
for the possession of one man only? Alas! it is but too true that some of the
French belles need no encouragement to infidelity: too soon all scruple is
stifled in their bosom; and then, they not only set modesty, but decency too at
defiance. <i>Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute</i>; or, as the same idea is
more fully expressed by our great moral poet:</p>
<p class="bq">"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,<br />
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;<br />
Yet, seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br />
We first endure, then pity, then embrace."</p>
<p>However, in both the instances which I have adduced, the fault was entirely
on the side of the men; and, in general, I believe this will prove to be the
case. Recrimination, indeed, is loudly urged by our sex in Paris; they blame
the women, with a view of extenuating their own irregularities, which scarcely
know any limits.</p>
<p>On a question of a divorce-bill brought on, not long since, in the House of
Commons, you may recollect that a member was laughed at, for asserting that if
men expected women to reform, they ought to begin by reforming themselves. For
my part, I conceive the idea to be perfectly just. Infidelity on the woman's
side is, unquestionably, more hurtful to society than a failure of the same
sort on the man's; yet, is it reasonable to suppose women to be so exempt from
human frailty, as to preserve their chastity inviolate, when men set them so
bad an example?</p>
<h2><a name="let88">LETTER LXXXVIII.</a></h2>
<p class="right"><i>Paris, April 3, 1802</i>.</p>
<p>Circumstances have at length occurred to recall me to England, and as this
will, probably, be the last letter that you will receive from me before I have
the pleasure of taking you by the hand, I shall devote it to miscellaneous
subjects, and, without studying any particular arrangement, speak of them at
random, just as they chance to present themselves.</p>
<p>A fellow-creature, whose care-worn countenance and emaciated body claimed a
mite from any one who had a mite to bestow, had taken his stand at the gate-way
just now as I entered. The recollection of his tale of woe being uppermost in
my mind, I begin with</p>
<p class="center">MENDICANTS.</p>
<p>In spite of the calamities which all great political convulsions never fail
to engender, the streets of Paris present not at this day that vast crowd of
beggars, covered with rags and vermin, by which they were formerly infested.
This is to be attributed to the partial adoption of measures for employing the
poor; and, doubtless, when receptacles come to be established here, according
to the salutary plans introduced into Bavaria by Count Rumford, mendicity will
be gradually annihilated.</p>
<p>But, if beggars have decreased in Paris, this is not the case with</p>
<p class="center">PAWNBROKERS.</p>
<p><a name="let88fr1"></a>They seem to have multiplied in proportion to the
increase of the number of opportunities afforded for gambling in the lottery,
that is, in the ratio of 21 to 2.[<a href="#let88f1">1</a>]</p>
<p>Formerly, in addition to the public establishment called the <i>Mont de
Piété</i>, commissioners were appointed, in different parts of the town, to
take in pledges, and make advances on them previously to their being lodged in
that grand repository. There, money was lent on them at an interest of 10 per
cent; and if the article pledged was not redeemed by a certain time, it was
sold by public auction, and, the principal and interest being deducted, the
surplus was paid to the holder of the duplicate. Thus the iniquitous projects
of usury were defeated; and the rich, as well as the poor, went to borrow at
the <i>Mont de Piété</i>. To obtain a sum for the discharge of a debt of
honour, a dutchess here deposited her diamond ear-rings; while a washerwoman
slipped off her petticoat, and pawned it to satisfy the cravings of hunger.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the <i>Mont de Piété</i> still exists; but,
doubtless, on a different plan; for Paris abounds with <i>Maisons de prêt</i>.
On the eve of particular days in each month when the shopkeepers' promissory
notes become due, they here pledge articles in order to procure the means of
making good their payments. But the crowd of borrowers is the greatest on the
days immediately preceding those on which the Paris lottery is drawn; the
hucksters, marketwomen, porters, retailers of fruit, and unfortunate females,
then deposit their wearing apparel at these dens of rapacity, that they may
acquire a share of a ticket, the price of which is fixed so low as to be within
the purchase of the poorest classes.</p>
<p>The lottery being over, till the next drawing, those persons think no more
of their effects, provided they are within two or three of the winning numbers;
and thus they gamble away almost every thing belonging to them, even to the
very clothes on their back. This is so true that it is not, I understand, at
all uncommon in Paris, for a Cyprian nymph to send her last robe to the nearest
pawnbroker's, in order to have the chance of a prize in the lottery, and to lie
in bed till she obtains the means of purchasing another. Nor is this by far the
worst part of the story.</p>
<p>The too credulous followers of Fortune, on finding all their hopes of
success blasted, frequently seek a termination of their misery by suicide: and
a person of veracity, who made a point of visiting the <i>Morne</i> almost
daily, assured me that he always knew when the lottery had just been drawn, by
the increased number of dead bodies, there exposed, of persons who had put an
end to their existence.</p>
<p>These are facts shocking to relate; but, if legislators will promote gaming,
either by lotteries, or in any other manner, such are the consequences to be
expected.</p>
<p>Another article which has multiplied prodigiously in Paris, since the
revolution, consists of</p>
<p class="center">NEWSPAPERS.</p>
<p>In 1789, the only daily papers in circulation here were the <i>Journal de
Paris</i> and the <i>Petites Affiches</i>; for the <i>Gazette de France</i>
appeared only twice a week. From that period, these ephemeral productions
increased so rapidly, that, under the generic name of <i>Journaux</i>, upwards
of six thousand, bearing different titles, have appeared in France, five
hundred of which were published in Paris.</p>
<p>At this time, here is a great variety of daily papers. The most eminent of
these are well known in England; such as the <i>Moniteur</i>, the only official
paper, the sale of which is said to be 20,000 per day; that of the <i>Journal
de Paris</i>, 16,000; of the <i>Publiciste</i>, 14,000; of the <i>Journal des
Débats</i>, 12,000; of the <i>Journal des Défenseurs de la Patrie</i>, 10,000;
and of the <i>Clé du Cabinet</i>, 6,000. The sale of the others is
comparatively trifling, with the exception of the <i>Petites Affiches</i>, of
which the number daily sold exceeds 30,000.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>Journals</i>, which I mentioned in my letter of the
16th of December last, the most esteemed are the <i>Magazin Encyclopédique</i>,
edited by MILLIN, the <i>Annales de Chimie</i>, the <i>Journal des Arts</i>,
the <i>Journal Polytechnique</i>, the <i>Journal des Mines</i>, the <i>Journal
général des Inventions et des Découvertes</i>, &amp;c. I stop here, because it
would be useless to attempt to send you a complete list of all the French
periodical publications, as, in the flux and reflux of this literary ocean,
such a list cannot long be expected to preserve its exactness.</p>
<p>Among the conveniences which this city affords in an enviable degree and in
great abundance, are</p>
<p class="center">BATHS.</p>
<p>Those of Paris, of every description, still retain their former
pre-eminence. The most elegant are the <i>Bains Chinois</i> on the north
Boulevards, where, for three francs, you may enjoy the pleasure of bathing in
almost as much luxury as an Asiatic monarch. Near the <i>Temple</i> and at the
<i>Vauxhall d'Été</i>, also on the old Boulevards, are baths, where you have
the advantage of a garden to saunter in after bathing.</p>
<p>On the Seine are several floating baths, the most remarkable of which are
the <i>Bains Vigier</i>, at the foot of the <i>Pont National</i>. The vessel
containing them is upwards of 200 feet in length by about 60 in breadth, and
presents two tiers of baths, making, on both decks, 140 in number. It is
divided in the middle by a large transparent plate of glass, which permits the
eye to embrace its whole extent; one half of which is appropriated to men; the
other, to women. On each deck are galleries, nine feet wide, ornamented with
much architectural taste. On the exterior part of the vessel is a promenade,
decorated with evergreens, orange and rose trees, jasmines, and other
odoriferous plants. By means of a hydraulic machine, worked by two horses, in
an adjoining barge, the reservoirs can be emptied and filled again in less than
an hour.</p>
<p>The <i>Bains Vigier</i> are much frequented, as you may suppose from their
daily consumption of two cords of wood for fuel. Tepid baths, at blood-heat,
are, at present, universally used by the French ladies, and, apparently, with
no small advantage. The price of one of these is no more than 30 <i>sous</i>,
linen, &amp;c. included.</p>
<p>If you want to learn to swim, you may be instructed here in that necessary
art, or merely take a look at those acquiring it, at the</p>
<p class="center">SCHOOL OF NATATION.</p>
<p>The Seine is the school where the lessons are given, and the police takes
care that the pupils infringe not the laws of decency.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<p>It is certain that, as far back as the year 1684, means were proposed in
London to transmit signs to a great distance in a very short space of time, and
that, towards the close of the seventeenth century, a member of the Academy of
Sciences made, near Paris, several minute experiments on the same subject. The
paper read at the Royal Society of London, and the detail of the experiments
made in France, seem to suggest nearly the same means as those now put in
practice, by the two nations, with respect to</p>
<p class="center">TELEGRAPHS.</p>
<p>The construction of those in France differs from ours in consisting of one
principal pole, and two arms, moveable at the ends. There are four in Paris;
one, on the <i>Louvre</i>, which corresponds with Lille; another, on the
<i>Place de la Concorde</i>, with Brest; a third, on one of the towers of the
church of <i>St. Sulpice</i>, with Strasburg; and the fourth, on the other
tower of the said church, which is meant to extend to Nice, but is as yet
carried no farther than Dijon. To and from Lille, which is 120 leagues distant
from Paris, intelligence is conveyed and received in six minutes, three for the
question, and three for the answer.</p>
<p>Yet, however expeditious this intercourse may seem, it is certain that the
telegraphic language may be abridged, by preserving these machines in their
present state, but at the same time allotting to each of the signs a greater
portion of idea, without introducing any thing vague into the
signification.</p>
<p>Independently of the public curiosities, which I have described, Paris
contains several</p>
<p class="center">PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.</p>
<p>Among them, those most deserving of attention are:</p>
<p>ADANSON'S cabinet of Natural History, <i>Rue de la Victoire</i>.</p>
<p>CASAS' cabinet of Models and Drawings, <i>Rue de Seine, Faubourg St.
Germain</i>.</p>
<p>CHARLES'S cabinet of Physics, <i>Palais National des Sciences et des
Arts.</i></p>
<p>DENON'S cabinet of Drawings, &amp;c. <i>Hôtel de Bouillon</i>, <i>Rue J. J.
Rousseau</i>.</p>
<p>FOUQUET'S cabinet of Models of Antique Monuments, <i>Rue de Lille</i>, <i>F.
S. G.</i></p>
<p>HAUPOIS' cabinet of Mechanics.</p>
<p>SUË'S cabinet of Anatomy, <i>Rue du Luxembourg</i>.</p>
<p>TERSAN'S cabinet of Antiquities, <i>Cloître St. Honoré</i>.</p>
<p>VAILLANT'S cabinet of Birds, &amp;c. <i>Rue du Sépulchre</i>, <i>F. S.
G.</i></p>
<p>VAN-HORREN'S cabinet of Curiosities, <i>Rue St. Dominique</i>, <i>F. S.
G.</i></p>
<p>I must observe that, to visit these men of science, without putting them to
inconvenience, it is expedient either to procure an introduction, or to address
them a note, requesting permission to view their cabinet. This observation
holds good with respect to every thing that is not public.</p>
<p>If you are fond of inspecting curious fire-arms, you should examine the
<i>dépôt d'armes</i> of M. BOUTET in the <i>Rue de la Loi</i>, whose
manufactory is at Versailles, and also pay a visit to M. REGNIER, at the
<i>Dépôt Central de l'Artillerie</i>, <i>Rue de l'Université</i>, who is a very
ingenious mechanic, and will shew you several curious articles of his own
invention, such as a <i>dynamomètre</i>, by means of which you can ascertain
and compare the relative strength of men, as well as that of horses and
draught-cattle, and also judge of the resistance of machines, and estimate the
moving power you wish to apply to them; a <i>potamomètre</i>, by which you can
tell the force of running streams, and measure the currents of rivers. M.
REGNIER has also invented different kinds of locks and padlocks, which cannot
be picked; as well as some curious pistols, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I have, as you will perceive, strictly confined myself to the limits of the
capital, because I expect that my absence from it will not be long; and, in my
next trip to France, I intend, not only to point out such objects as I may now
have neglected, but also to describe those most worthy of notice in the
environs of Paris.</p>
<p>If I have not spoken to you of all the metamorphoses occasioned here by the
revolution, it is because several of them bear not the stamp of novelty. If the
exchange in Paris is now held in the <i>ci-devant Eglise des Petits Pères</i>,
did we not at Boston, in New England, convert the meeting-houses and churches
into riding-schools and barracks?</p>
<p>As the <i>Charnier des Innocens</i>, which had subsisted in the centre of
Paris for upwards of eight centuries, and received the remains of at least ten
millions of human beings, was, before the revolution, turned into a
market-place; so is the famous spot where the Jacobin convent stood in the
<i>Rue St. Honoré</i>, and whence issued laws more bloody than those of Draco,
now on the point of being appropriated to a similar destination. The cemetery
of St. Sulpice is transformed into a Ranelagh. Over the entrance is written, in
large letters, encircled by roses, "BAL DES ZÉPHYRS," and, underneath, you
read:</p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Has ultra metas requiescunt<br />
Beatam spem expectantes."</i></p>
<p>And on the door itself:</p>
<p class="bq"><i>"Expectances misericordiam Dei."</i></p>
<p>I was just going to conclude with <i>Adieu, till we meet</i>, when I was
most agreeably surprised by the receipt of your letter. I am happy to find
that, through the kind attention of Mr. Mantell of Dover, whose good offices on
this and other simllar occasions claim my most grateful acknowledgments, you
have received all the packets and books which I have addressed to you during my
present visit to Paris. It is likewise no small gratification to me to learn
that my correspondence has afforded to you a few subjects of deep
reflection.</p>
<p>As I told you at the time, the task which you imposed on me was more than I
could accomplish; and you must now be but too well convinced that the
apprehension of my inability was not unfounded. It may not, perhaps, be
difficult for a man of sound judgment to seize and delineate the general
progress of the human mind during a determined period; but to follow
successively, through all their details, the ramifications of the arts and
sciences, is a labour which requires much more knowledge and experience than I
can pretend to: nor did self-love ever blind me so far as to lead me to
presume, for a moment, that success would crown my efforts.</p>
<p>However, I think I have said enough to shew that one of the striking effects
of the revolution has been to make the arts and sciences popular in France. It
has rendered common those doctrines which had till then been reserved for
first-rate <i>savans</i> and genuises. The arsenals of the sciences (if I may
use the expression) were filled; but soldiers were wanting. The revolution has
produced them in considerable numbers; and, in spite of all the disasters and
evils which it has occasioned, it cannot be denied that the minds of Frenchmen,
susceptible of the least energy, have here received a powerful impulse which
has urged them towards great and useful ideas. This impulse has been kept alive
and continued by the grand establishments of public instruction, founded during
the course of that memorable period. Thus, in a few words, you are at once in
possession both of the causes and the result of the progress of the human mind
in this country.</p>
<p>You may, probably, be surprised that I could have written so much, in so
short a space of time, amid all the allurements of the French capital, and the
variety of pursuits which must necessarily have diverted my attention. Perhaps
too, you may think that I might have dwelt less on some of my least interesting
details. I must confess that I have, in some measure, subjected myself to such
an opinion; but, knowing your wish to acquire every sort of information, I have
exerted myself to obtain it from all quarters. To collect this budget has been
no easy task; to compress it would have been still more difficult, and, alas!
to have transmitted it, in an epistolary form, would have been totally out of
my power, but for the assistance of two very ingenious artists, who have not a
little contributed to lighten my labour. Introducing themselves to me, very
shortly after my arrival, the one furnished me with an everlasting pen; and the
other, with an inexhaustible inkstand.</p>
<p>Farewell, my good friend. I have obtained a passport for England. My baggage
is already packed up. To-morrow I shall devote to the ceremony of making visits
<i>p. p. c.</i> that is, <i>pour prendre congé</i> of my Parisian friends; and,
on the day after, <i>(Deo volente)</i> I shall bid adieu to the "paradise of
women, the purgatory of men, and the hell of horses."</p>

End of Project Gutenberg's Paris As It Was and As It Is, by Francis W. Blagdon

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARIS AS IT WAS AND AS IT IS ***

This file should be named 8pari10h.htm or 8pari10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8pari11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8pari10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright

distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
