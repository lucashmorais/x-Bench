<h1>
Judges
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> It happened after the
death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall
go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:
behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Judah said to Simeon his brother,
Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and
I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.
 <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Judah went up; and Yahweh
delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they
struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek;
and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the
Perizzites.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> But
Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off
his thumbs and his great toes.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Adoni-Bezek said, &quot;Seventy
kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <I>their
food</I> under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me.&quot;
They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> The children of Judah fought
against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
and set the city on fire.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Afterward the children of Judah
went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country,
and in the South, and in the lowland.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Judah went against the Canaanites
who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and
they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> From there he went against the
inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)
 <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Caleb said, He who
strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter as wife.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Othniel
the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah
his daughter as wife.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> It
happened, when she came <I>to him</I>, that she moved him to ask of her
father a field: and she alighted from off her donkey; and Caleb said to
her, What would you?  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> She
said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of
the South, give me also springs of water. Caleb gave her the upper springs
and the lower springs.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> The children of the Kenite,
Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the
children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of
Arad; and they went and lived with the people.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Judah went with Simeon his
brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly
destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Also Judah took Gaza with its
border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> Yahweh was with Judah; and drove
out <I>the inhabitants of</I> the hill country; for he could not drive out
the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> They gave Hebron to Caleb, as
Moses had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> The children of Benjamin did not
drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell
with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> The house of Joseph, they also
went up against Bethel; and Yahweh was with them.  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> The house of Joseph sent to spy
out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> The watchers saw a man come forth
out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance
into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> He showed them the entrance into
the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they
let the man go and all his family.  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> The man went into the land of the
Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to
this day.  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> Manasseh did
not drive out <I>the inhabitants of</I> Beth Shean and its towns, nor
<I>of</I> Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns,
nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of
Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
 <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> It happened, when Israel
had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did
not utterly drive them out.  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> Ephraim didn't drive out the
Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among
them.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> Zebulun didn't
drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but
the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
 <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> Asher didn't drive out
the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor
of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> but the Asherites lived among the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
 <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> Naphtali didn't drive out
the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he
lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced
labor.  <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> The Amorites
forced the children of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow
them to come down to the valley;  <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> but the Amorites would dwell in
Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of
Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> The border of the Amorites was
from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, I made you to go up out of Egypt,
and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I
said, I will never break my covenant with you:  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> and you shall make no covenant
with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars. But
you have not listened to my voice: why have you done this?  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Therefore I also said, I will not
drive them out from before you; but they shall be <I>as thorns</I> in your
sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> It happened, when the angel of
Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people
lifted up their voice, and wept.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> They called the name of that place
Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Now when Joshua had sent the
people away, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to
possess the land.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> The
people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the
elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that
he had worked for Israel.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant
of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> They buried him in the border of
his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the
north of the mountain of Gaash.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Also all that generation were
gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them,
who didn't know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
 <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> The children of Israel
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
 <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> and they forsook Yahweh,
the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and
followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and
bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Yahweh to anger.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> They forsook Yahweh, and served
Baal and the Ashtaroth.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled
against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who
despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all
around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
 <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Wherever they went out,
the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as
Yahweh had sworn to them: and they were sore distressed.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Yahweh raised up judges, who
saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Yet they didn't listen to their
judges; for they played the prostitute after other gods, and bowed
themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which
their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh; <I>but</I> they
didn't do so.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> When Yahweh
raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out
of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it grieved
Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and
troubled them.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> But it
happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more
corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and
to bow down to them; they didn't cease from their doings, nor from their
stubborn way.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The anger
of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation
have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have
not listened to my voice;  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> I also will not henceforth drive
out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
 <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> that by them I may prove
Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their
fathers did keep it, or not.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> So Yahweh left those nations,
without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand
of Joshua.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now these are the
nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many <I>of
Israel</I> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> only that the generations of the
children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as
before knew nothing of it:  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> <I>namely</I>, the five lords of
the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the
Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance
of Hamath.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> They were
<I>left</I>, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to
the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.
 <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> The children of Israel
lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> and they took their daughters to
be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served
their gods.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> The children
of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot
Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Therefore the anger of Yahweh was
kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan
Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan
Rishathaim eight years.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> When the children of Israel cried
to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved
them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh came on him,
and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan
Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed
against Cushan Rishathaim.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> The land had rest forty years.
Othniel the son of Kenaz died.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> The children of Israel again did
that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon
the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil
in the sight of Yahweh.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> He gathered to him the children
of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the
city of palm trees.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> The
children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> But when the children of Israel
cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the
Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him
to Eglon the king of Moab.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Ehud made him a sword which had
two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his clothing on his
right thigh.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> He offered
the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> When he had made an end of
offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.
 <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> But he himself turned
back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret
errand to you, king. He said, Keep silence. All who stood by him went out
from him.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> Ehud came to
him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud
said, I have a message from God to you. He arose out of his seat.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Ehud put forth his left hand, and
took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> and the haft also went in after
the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword
out of his body; and it came out behind.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Then Ehud went forth into the
porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.
 <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> Now when he was gone out,
his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room
were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper
chamber.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> They waited
until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open the doors of the upper
room: therefore they took the key, and opened <I>them</I>, and behold,
their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> Ehud escaped while they waited,
and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> It happened, when he had come,
that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of
Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
 <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> He said to them, Follow
after me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your
hand. They went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against
the Moabites, and didn't allow a man to pass over.  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> They struck of Moab at that time
about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there
escaped not a man.  <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> So
Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest
eighty years.  <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> After him
was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred
men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Israel.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> The children of Israel
again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
 <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Yahweh sold them into the
hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose
army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> The children of Israel cried to
Yahweh: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he
mightily oppressed the children of Israel.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the
wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> She lived under the palm tree of
Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the
children of Israel came up to her for judgment.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> She sent and called Barak the son
of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't Yahweh, the God
of Israel, commanded, <I>saying</I>, Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take
with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children
of Zebulun?  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> I will draw to
you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his
chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Barak said to her, If you will go
with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
 <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> She said, I will surely go
with you: notwithstanding, the journey that you take shall not be for your
honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. Deborah
arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali
together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and
Deborah went up with him.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Now Heber the Kenite had
separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the
brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in
Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> They told Sisera that Barak the
son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Sisera gathered together all his
chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were
with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Deborah said to Barak, Up; for
this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand;
hasn't Yahweh gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor,
and ten thousand men after him.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Yahweh confused Sisera, and all
his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak;
and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> But Barak pursued after the
chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the
army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
 <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> However Sisera fled away
on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there
was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the
Kenite.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Jael went out to
meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don't be
afraid. He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
 <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> He said to her, Please
give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. She opened a bottle of
milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> He said to her, Stand in the door
of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and inquire of you,
and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Then Jael Heber's wife took a
tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and
struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground;
for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera,
Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the
man whom you seek. He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the
tent peg was in his temples.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> So God subdued on that day Jabin
the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> The hand of the children of
Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until
they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Then Deborah and Barak
the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Because the leaders
took the lead in Israel,
<dd>because the people offered themselves willingly,
<dt>be blessed, Yahweh!
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Hear, you kings!
<dd>Give ear, you princes!
<dt>I, <I>even</I> I, will sing to Yahweh.
<dd>I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Yahweh, when you went
forth out of Seir,
<dd>when you marched out of the field of Edom,
<dt>the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
<dd>Yes, the clouds dropped water.
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> The mountains quaked
at the presence of Yahweh,
<dd>even Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> In the days of Shamgar
the son of Anath,
<dd>in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.
<dd>The travelers walked through byways.
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> The rulers ceased in
Israel.
<dd>They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
<dd>Until I arose a mother in Israel.
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> They chose new gods.
<dd>Then war was in the gates.
<dd>Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> My heart is toward the
governors of Israel,
<dd>who offered themselves willingly among the people.
<dd>Bless Yahweh!
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Tell <I>of it</I>,
you who ride on white donkeys,
<dd>you who sit on rich carpets,
<dd>and you who walk by the way.
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Far from the noise of
archers, in the places of drawing water,
<dd>there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh,
<dd><I>Even</I> the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
<dd>Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
<dd>
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Awake, awake, Deborah!
<dd>Awake, awake, utter a song!
<dd>Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Then a remnant of the
nobles <I>and</I> the people came down.
<dd>Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.

<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> The princes of
Issachar were with Deborah.
<dd>As was Issachar, so was Barak.
<dd>They rushed into the valley at his feet.
<dt>By the watercourses of Reuben,
<dd>there were great resolves of heart.
<dt> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Why did you sit among
the sheepfolds,

<dt>At the watercourses of Reuben
<dd>There were great searchings of heart.
<dt> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> Gilead lived beyond
the Jordan.
<dd>Why did Dan remain in ships?
<dd>Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,

<dt> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Zebulun was a people

<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> The kings came and

</dl>
<p>The land had rest forty years.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> The children of Israel
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh delivered them
into the hand of Midian seven years.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> The hand of Midian prevailed
against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the
dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
 <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> So it was, when Israel had
sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of
the east; they came up against them;  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> and they encamped against them,
and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left
no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> For they came up with their
livestock and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both
they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to
destroy it.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Israel was
brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to
Yahweh.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> It happened, when
the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> that Yahweh sent a prophet to the
children of Israel: and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
house of bondage;  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> and I
delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their
land;  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> and I said to you,
I am Yahweh your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in
whose land you dwell. But you have not listened to my voice.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> The angel of Yahweh came, and sat
under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite:
and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from
the Midianites.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> The angel
of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him, Yahweh is with you, you mighty
man of valor.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Gideon said
to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened
to us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of,
saying, Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us
off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Yahweh looked at him, and said,
Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I
sent you?  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> He said to him,
Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest
in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> Yahweh said to him, Surely I will
be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> He said to him, If now I have
found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk
with me.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> Please don't go
away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before
you. He said, I will wait until you come again.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Gideon went in, and made ready a
kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a
basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the
oak, and presented it.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> The angel of God said to him,
Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and
pour out the broth. He did so.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Then the angel of Yahweh put
forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and
the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed
the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed out
of his sight.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> Gideon saw
that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, Alas, Lord Yahweh!
because I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> Yahweh said to him, Peace be to
you; don't be afraid: you shall not die.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> Then Gideon built an altar there
to Yahweh, and called it <a href="#N1">Yahweh is Peace</a>: to this day it
is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> It happened the same night, that
Yahweh said to him, Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven
years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut
down the Asherah that is by it;  <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> and build an altar to Yahweh your
God on the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the
second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which
you shall cut down.  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> Then
Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to him:
and it happened, because he feared his father's household and the men of
the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
 <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> When the men of the city
arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and
the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered
on the altar that was built.  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> They said one to another, Who has
done this thing? When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son
of Joash has done this thing.  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> Then the men of the city said to
Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the
altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
 <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> Joash said to all who
stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? he who
will contend for him, let him be put to death while <I>it is yet</I>
morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has
broken down his altar.  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> Therefore on that day he named
him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken
down his altar.  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> Then all
the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled
themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of
Jezreel.  <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> But the Spirit
of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered
together after him.  <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> He
sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered
together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and
to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.  <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> Gideon said to God, If you will
save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,  <a name="C6V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:37</font></a> behold, I will put a fleece of
wool on the threshing floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be
dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my
hand, as you have spoken.  <a name="C6V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:38</font></a> It was so; for he rose up early
on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of
the fleece, a bowl full of water.  <a name="C6V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:39</font></a> Gideon said to God, Don't let
your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: Please
let me make a trial just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only
on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.  <a name="C6V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:40</font></a> God did so that night: for it was
dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Then Jerubbaal, who is
Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped
beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side
of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Yahweh said to Gideon, The people
who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their
hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has
saved me.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Now therefore
proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and
trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead. There returned of
the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Yahweh said to Gideon, The people
are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for
you there: and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with
you, the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, This shall not
go with you, the same shall not go.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> So he brought down the people to
the water: and Yahweh said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with
his tongue, as a dog laps, him you shall set by himself; likewise everyone
who bows down on his knees to drink.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> The number of those who lapped,
putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest
of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Yahweh said to Gideon, By the
three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites
into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> So the people took food in their
hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to
his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was
beneath him in the valley.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> It happened the same night, that
Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have
delivered it into your hand.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> But if you fear to go down, go
you with Purah your servant down to the camp:  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> and you shall hear what they say;
and afterward your will hands be strengthened to go down into the camp.
Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the
armed men who were in the camp.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> The Midianites and the Amalekites
and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for
multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on
the seashore for multitude.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> When Gideon had come, behold,
there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I
dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp
of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned
it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> His fellow answered, This is
nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:
into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> It was so, when Gideon heard the
telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped; and he
returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has
delivered into your hand the army of Midian.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> He divided the three hundred men
into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets,
and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> He said to them, Look on me, and
do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it
shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> When I blow the trumpet, I and
all who are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all
the camp, and say, For Yahweh and for Gideon.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> So Gideon, and the hundred men
who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning
of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew
the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
 <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> The three companies blew
the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left
hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they
cried, The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> They stood every man in his place
around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put
<I>them</I> to flight.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> They blew the three hundred
trumpets, and Yahweh set every man's sword against his fellow, and against
all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as
far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> The men of Israel were gathered
together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
pursued after Midian.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Gideon sent messengers throughout
all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and
take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan. So all
the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as
Beth Barah, even the Jordan.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> They took the two princes of
Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb
they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought
the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> The men of Ephraim
said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you didn't call us, when
you went to fight with Midian? They did chide with him sharply.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> He said to them, What have I now
done in comparison with you? Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim
better than the vintage of Abiezer?  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> God has delivered into your hand
the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in
comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had
said that.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Gideon came to
the Jordan, <I>and</I> passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were
with him, faint, yet pursuing.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> He said to the men of Succoth,
Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are
faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
 <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> The princes of Succoth
said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should
give bread to your army?  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh
has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh
with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> He went up there to Penuel, and
spoke to them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the
men of Succoth had answered.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> He spoke also to the men of
Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
 <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Now Zebah and Zalmunna
were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men,
all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there
fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Gideon went up by the way of
those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the
army; for the army was secure.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he
pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and
Zalmunna, and confused all the army.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Gideon the son of Joash returned
from the battle from the ascent of Heres.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> He caught a young man of the men
of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of
Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> He came to the men of Succoth,
and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you did taunt me,
saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we
should give bread to your men who are weary?  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> He took the elders of the city,
and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men
of Succoth.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> He broke down
the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Then said he to Zebah and
Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you killed at Tabor? They
answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a
king.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> He said, They were
my brothers, the sons of my mother: as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them
alive, I would not kill you.  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> He said to Jether his firstborn,
Up, and kill them. But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared,
because he was yet a youth.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said,
Rise you, and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength. Gideon
arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on
their camels' necks.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> Then
the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your
son, and your son's son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of
Midian.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> Gideon said to
them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Yahweh
shall rule over you.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Gideon said to them, I would make
a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his
spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
 <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> They answered, We will
willingly give them. They spread a garment, and did cast therein every man
the earrings of his spoil.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> The weight of the golden earrings
that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred <I>shekels</I> of
gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing
that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about
their camels' necks.  <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> Gideon made an ephod of it, and
put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the prostitute
after it there; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.  <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> So Midian was subdued before the
children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had
rest forty years in the days of Gideon.  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> Jerubbaal the son of Joash went
and lived in his own house.  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Gideon had seventy sons conceived
from his body; for he had many wives.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> His concubine who was in Shechem,
she also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> Gideon the son of Joash died in a
good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of
the Abiezrites.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> It
happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned
again, and played the prostitute after the Baals, and made Baal Berith
their god.  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> The children
of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of
the hand of all their enemies on every side;  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> neither did they show kindness to
the house of Jerubbaal, <I>who is</I> Gideon, according to all the
goodness which he had shown to Israel.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Abimelech the son of
Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and spoke with them,
and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
 <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> Please speak in the ears
of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of
Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over
you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> His mother's brothers spoke of him
in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts
inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> They gave him seventy
<I>pieces</I> of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which
Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> He went to his father's house at
Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy
persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
for he hid himself.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> All
the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of
Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was
in Shechem.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> When they told
it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up
his voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem,
that God may listen to you.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> The trees went forth on a time to
anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over
us.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> But the olive tree
said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God
and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> The trees said to the fig tree,
Come you, and reign over us.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> But the fig tree said to them,
Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and
forth over the trees?  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> The
trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> The vine said to them, Should I
leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth
over the trees?  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Then said
all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> The bramble said to the trees, If
in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my
shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars
of Lebanon.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> Now
therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made
Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house,
and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> (for my father fought for you,
and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
 <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> and you are risen up
against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy
persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female
servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
 <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> if you then have dealt
truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then
rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> but if not, let fire come out
from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and
let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
and devour Abimelech.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> Jotham ran away, and fled, and
went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Abimelech was prince over Israel
three years.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> God sent an
evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of
Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> that the violence done to the
seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid
on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem,
who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> The men of Shechem set an ambush
for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along
that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> Gaal the son of Ebed came with
his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their
trust in him.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> They went
out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod <I>the
grapes</I>, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and
did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is
Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn't he the son
of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father
of Shechem: but why should we serve him?  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Would that this people were under
my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. He said to Abimelech, Increase
your army, and come out.  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> When Zebul the ruler of the city
heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> He sent messengers to Abimelech
craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers are come
to Shechem; and behold, they constrain the city <I>to take part</I>
against you.  <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> Now
therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in
wait in the field:  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> and it
shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise
early, and rush on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are
with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find
occasion.  <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> Abimelech rose
up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait
against Shechem in four companies.  <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> Gaal the son of Ebed went out,
and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up,
and the people who were with him, from the ambush.  <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> When Gaal saw the people, he said
to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.
Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were
men.  <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> Gaal spoke again and
said, Behold, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one
company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.  <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> Then said Zebul to him, Where is
now your mouth, that you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?
is not this the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray, and
fight with them.  <a name="C9V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:39</font></a> Gaal
went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.  <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> Abimelech chased him, and he fled
before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
 <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> Abimelech lived at
Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not
dwell in Shechem.  <a name="C9V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:42</font></a> It
happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and
they told Abimelech.  <a name="C9V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:43</font></a> He
took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in
the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the
city; He rose up against them, and struck them.  <a name="C9V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:44</font></a> Abimelech, and the companies that
were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of
the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and
struck them.  <a name="C9V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:45</font></a> Abimelech
fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the
people who were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with
salt.  <a name="C9V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:46</font></a> When all the men of
the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the
house of Elberith.  <a name="C9V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:47</font></a> It was
told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered
together.  <a name="C9V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:48</font></a> Abimelech got
him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and
Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees,
and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people who
were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have
done.  <a name="C9V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:49</font></a> All the people
likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put
them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that
all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and
women.  <a name="C9V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:50</font></a> Then went
Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.  <a name="C9V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:51</font></a> But there was a strong tower
within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the
city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.
 <a name="C9V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:52</font></a> Abimelech came to the
tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to
burn it with fire.  <a name="C9V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:53</font></a> A
certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and broke his
skull.  <a name="C9V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:54</font></a> Then he called
hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your
sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, A woman killed him. His young
man thrust him through, and he died.  <a name="C9V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:55</font></a> When the men of Israel saw that
Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.  <a name="C9V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:56</font></a> Thus God requited the wickedness
of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
 <a name="C9V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:57</font></a> and all the wickedness of
the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads: and on them came the
curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> After Abimelech there
arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of
Issachar; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> He judged Israel twenty-three
years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> After him arose Jair, the
Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> He had thirty sons who rode on
thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth
Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Jair died, and was buried in
Kamon.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> The children of
Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served
the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of
Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and
the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve
him.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> The anger of Yahweh
was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> They troubled and oppressed the
children of Israel that year: eighteen years <I>oppressed they</I> all the
children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the
Amorites, which is in Gilead.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> The children of Ammon passed over
the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against
the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> The children of Israel cried to
Yahweh, saying, We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken
our God, and have served the Baals.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Yahweh said to the children of
Israel, Didn't I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> The Sidonians also, and the
Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I
saved you out of their hand.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> Yet you have forsaken me, and
served other gods: therefore I will save you no more.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Go and cry to the gods which you
have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> The children of Israel said to
Yahweh, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; only
deliver us, we pray you, this day.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> They put away the foreign gods
from among them, and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the
misery of Israel.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Then
the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. The
children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
 <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> The people, the princes
of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he who will begin to fight
against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants
of Gilead.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Now Jephthah the
Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute:
and Gilead became the father of Jephthah.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Gilead's wife bore him sons; and
when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him,
You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of
another woman.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> Then
Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there
were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
 <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> It happened after a
while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> It was so, that when the children
of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get
Jephthah out of the land of Tob;  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> and they said to Jephthah, Come
and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Jephthah said to the elders of
Gilead, Didn't you hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? and why
are you come to me now when you are in distress?  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> The elders of Gilead said to
Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to you now, that you may go with
us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over
all the inhabitants of Gilead.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Jephthah said to the elders of
Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon,
and Yahweh deliver them before me, shall I be your head?  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> The elders of Gilead said to
Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness between us; surely according to your
word so will we do.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Then
Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and
chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
 <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Jephthah sent messengers
to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me,
that you are come to me to fight against my land?  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> The king of the children of
Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my
land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and
to the Jordan: now therefore restore those <I>lands</I> again peaceably.
 <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Jephthah sent messengers
again to the king of the children of Ammon;  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> and he said to him, Thus says
Jephthah: Israel didn't take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the
children of Ammon,  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> but
when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to
the <a href="#N2">Red Sea</a>, and came to Kadesh;  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> then Israel sent messengers to
the king of Edom, saying, Please let me pass through your land; but the
king of Edom didn't listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab;
but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Then they went through the
wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and
came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other
side of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab, for the
Arnon was the border of Moab.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> Israel sent messengers to Sihon
king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us
pass, we pray you, through your land to my place.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> But Sihon didn't trust Israel to
pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and
encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Yahweh, the God of Israel,
delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they
struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the
inhabitants of that country.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> They possessed all the border of
the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness
even to the Jordan.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> So
now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before
his people Israel, and should you possess them?  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Won't you possess that which
Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has
dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Now are you anything better than
Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel,
or did he ever fight against them?  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> While Israel lived in Heshbon
and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are
along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you
recover them within that time?  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> I therefore have not sinned
against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: Yahweh, the Judge, be
judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
 <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> However the king of the
children of Ammon didn't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent
him.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Then the Spirit of
Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and
passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to
the children of Ammon.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh,
and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
 <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> then it shall be, that
whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return
in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will
offer it up for a burnt offering.  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> So Jephthah passed over to the
children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into
his hand.  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> He struck them
from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to
Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were
subdued before the children of Israel.  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> Jephthah came to Mizpah to his
house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and
with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son
nor daughter.  <a name="C11V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:35</font></a> It
happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my
daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of those who
trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.
 <a name="C11V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:36</font></a> She said to him, My
father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that
which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance
for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.  <a name="C11V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:37</font></a> She said to her father, Let this
thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go
down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
 <a name="C11V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:38</font></a> He said, Go. He sent her
away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned
her virginity on the mountains.  <a name="C11V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:39</font></a> It happened at the end of two
months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his
vow which he had vowed: and she was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,
 <a name="C11V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:40</font></a> that the daughters of
Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
four days in a year.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> The men of Ephraim
were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah,
Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn't
call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> Jephthah said to them, I and my
people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called
you, you didn't save me out of their hand.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> When I saw that you didn't save
me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of
Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up to
me this day, to fight against me?  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Then Jephthah gathered together
all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead
struck Ephraim, because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you
Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, <I>and</I> in the midst of Manasseh.
 <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> The Gileadites took the
fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when <I>any
of</I> the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead
said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> then said they to him, Say now
Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he couldn't manage to pronounce it
right: then they laid hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the
Jordan. There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> Jephthah judged Israel six years.
Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <I>one of</I> the
cities of Gilead.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> After
him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> He had thirty sons; and thirty
daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad
for his sons. He judged Israel seven years.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Ibzan died, and was buried at
Bethlehem.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> After him
Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> Elon the Zebulunite died, and
was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> After him Abdon the son of
Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> He had forty sons and thirty
sons' sons, who rode on seventy donkey colts: and he judged Israel eight
years.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Abdon the son of
Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of
Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> The children of Israel
again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered
them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> There was a certain man of Zorah,
of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was
barren, and didn't bear.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> The angel of Yahweh appeared to
the woman, and said to her, See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but
you shall conceive, and bear a son.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Now therefore please beware and
drink no wine nor strong drink, and don't eat any unclean thing:  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> for, behold, you shall conceive,
and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall
be a Nazirite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out
of the hand of the Philistines.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Then the woman came and told her
husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face
of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him whence he was,
neither did he tell me his name:  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> but he said to me, Behold, you
shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink,
and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God
from the womb to the day of his death.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and
said, Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to
us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> God listened to the voice of
Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the
field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> The woman made haste, and ran,
and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me,
who came to me the <I>other</I> day.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> Manoah arose, and went after his
wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to
the woman? He said, I am.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Manoah said, Now let your words
happen: what shall be the ordering of the child, and <I>how</I> shall we
do to him?  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> The angel of
Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
 <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> She may not eat of
anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong
drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her
observe.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Manoah said to
the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you, that we may make ready
a kid for you.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> The angel
of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread;
and if you will make ready a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.
For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of Yahweh.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Manoah said to the angel of
Yahweh, What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?
 <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> The angel of Yahweh said
to him, Why do you ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> So Manoah took the kid with the
meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh: and <I>the angel</I>
did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> For it happened, when the flame
went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh
ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and
they fell on their faces to the ground.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> But the angel of Yahweh did no
more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the
angel of Yahweh.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> Manoah
said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> But his wife said to him, If
Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering
and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these
things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> The woman bore a son, and named
him Samson: and the child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh began to
move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Samson went down to
Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
 <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> He came up, and told his
father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the
daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife.
 <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> Then his father and his
mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your
brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the
uncircumcised Philistines? Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for
she pleases me well.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> But
his father and his mother didn't know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought
an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had
rule over Israel.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Then
went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to
the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him.
 <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh came
mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a kid; and he had
nothing in his hand: but he didn't tell his father or his mother what he
had done.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> He went down,
and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> After a while he returned to take
her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there
was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> He took it into his hands, and
went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave
to them, and they ate: but he didn't tell them that he had taken the honey
out of the body of the lion.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> His father went down to the
woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
 <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> It happened, when they
saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Samson said to them, Let me now
put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven
days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen
garments and thirty changes of clothing;  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> but if you can't declare it to
me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of
clothing. They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
 <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> He said to them,
<dl>
<dt>Out of the eater came forth food.
<dd>Out of the strong came forth sweetness.
</dl>
<p>They couldn't in three days declare the riddle.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> It happened on the seventh day,
that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare
to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have
you called us to impoverish us? is it not <I>so</I>?  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> Samson's wife wept before him,
and said, You do but hate me, and don't love me: you have put forth a
riddle to the children of my people, and haven't told it me. He said to
her, Behold, I haven't told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell
you?  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> She wept before him
the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh
day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the
riddle to the children of her people.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> The men of the city said to him
on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?
and what is stronger than a lion? He said to them,
<dl>
<dt>If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,
<dd>you wouldn't have found out my riddle.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> The Spirit of Yahweh
came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men
of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes <I>of clothing</I> to
those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to
his father's house.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> But
Samson's wife was <I>given</I> to his companion, whom he had used as his
friend.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> But it happened after
a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a
kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father
wouldn't allow him to go in.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Her father said, I most certainly
thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your
companion: isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take
her, instead.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Samson said
to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when
I do them a mischief.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Samson went and caught three
hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a
firebrand in the midst between every two tails.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> When he had set the brands on
fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt
up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
 <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Then the Philistines
said, Who has done this? They said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,
because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion. The
Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> Samson said to them, If you do
after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will
cease.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> He struck them hip
and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft
of the rock of Etam.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> Then
the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in
Lehi.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> The men of Judah
said, Why are you come up against us? They said, To bind Samson are we
come up, to do to him as he has done to us.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Then three thousand men of Judah
went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson,
&quot;Don't you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is
this that you have done to us?&quot; He said to them, As they did to me,
so have I done to them.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> They said to him, We have come
down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the
Philistines. Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall on me
yourselves.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> They spoke
to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their
hand: but surely we will not kill you. They bound him with two new ropes,
and brought him up from the rock.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> When he came to Lehi, the
Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Yahweh came
mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that
was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> He found a fresh jawbone of a
donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men
therewith.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> Samson said,
With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey
I have struck a thousand men.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> It happened, when he had made an
end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that
place was called Ramath Lehi.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> He was very thirsty, and called
on Yahweh, and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of
your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of
the uncircumcised.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> But
God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When
he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name
was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> He judged Israel in the days of
the Philistines twenty years.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Samson went to Gaza,
and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> <I>It was told</I> the Gazites,
saying, Samson is come here. They surrounded him, and laid wait for him
all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying,
<I>Let be</I> until morning light, then we will kill him.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> Samson lay until midnight, and
arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and
the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his
shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before
Hebron.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> It came to pass
afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was
Delilah.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> The lords of the
Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in which
his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him,
that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will each give you of us
eleven hundred <I>pieces</I> of silver.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Delilah said to Samson, Tell me,
Please, in which your great strength lies, and with which you might be
bound to afflict you.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> Samson said to her, If they bind
me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak,
and be as another man.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Then the lords of the Philistines
brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she
bound him with them.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Now
she had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber. She said to him, &quot;The
Philistines are on you, Samson!&quot; He broke the cords, as a string of
tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
 <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> Delilah said to Samson,
Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, Please, with
which you might be bound.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> He said to her, If they only
bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I
become weak, and be as another man.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> So Delilah took new ropes, and
bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson.
The ambush was waiting in the inner chamber. He broke them off his arms
like a thread.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> Delilah
said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me
with which you might be bound. He said to her, If you weave the seven
locks of my head with the web.  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> She fastened it with the pin,
and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson. He awakened out of
his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> She said to him, How can you
say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these
three times, and have not told me in which your great strength lies.
 <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> It happened, when she
pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was
troubled to death.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> He
told her all his heart, and said to her, &quot;No razor has ever come on
my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am
shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be
like any other man.&quot;  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> When Delilah saw that he had
told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the
Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.
Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in
their hand.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> She made him
sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven
locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went
from him.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> She said, The
Philistines are on you, Samson. He awoke out of his sleep, and said, I
will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he didn't know
that Yahweh had departed from him.  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> The Philistines laid hold on
him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound
him with fetters of brass; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
 <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> However the hair of his
head began to grow again after he was shaved.  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> The lords of the Philistines
gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and
to rejoice; for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our
hand.  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> When the people
saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has delivered into
our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many
of us.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> It happened, when
their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make
us sport. They called for Samson out of the prison; and he made sport
before them. They set him between the pillars:  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> and Samson said to the boy who
held him by the hand, Allow me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the
house rests, that I may lean on them.  <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> Now the house was full of men
and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were
on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made
sport.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> Samson called to
Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, remember me, Please, and strengthen me,
Please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the
Philistines for my two eyes.  <a name="C16V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:29</font></a> Samson took hold of the two
middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with
his right hand, and the other with his left.  <a name="C16V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:30</font></a> Samson said, Let me die with the
Philistines. He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on
the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he
killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.
 <a name="C16V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:31</font></a> Then his brothers and
all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up,
and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his
father. He judged Israel twenty years.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> There was a man of the
hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> He said to his mother, The eleven
hundred <I>pieces</I> of silver that were taken from you, about which you
did utter a curse, and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is
with me; I took it. His mother said, Blessed be my son of Yahweh.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> He restored the eleven hundred
<I>pieces</I> of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I most
certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make
an engraved image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to
you.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> When he restored the
money to his mother, his mother took two hundred <I>pieces</I> of silver,
and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a
molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> The man Micah had a house of
gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons,
who became his priest.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> In
those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right
in his own eyes.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> There
was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a
Levite; and he sojourned there.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> The man departed out of the city,
out of Bethlehem Judah, to sojourn where he could find <I>a place</I>, and
he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he
traveled.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> Micah said to
him, Whence come you? He said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah,
and I go to sojourn where I may find <I>a place</I>.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> Micah said to him, Dwell with
me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten
<I>pieces</I> of silver by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your
food. So the Levite went in.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> The Levite was content to dwell
with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> Micah consecrated the Levite,
and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
 <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Then said Micah, Now
know I that Yahweh will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> In those days there
was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought
them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day <I>their</I> inheritance
had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> The children of Dan sent of their
family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and
from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to
them, Go, search the land. They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to
the house of Micah, and lodged there.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> When they were by the house of
Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned
aside there, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in
this place? and what have you here?  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> He said to them, Thus and thus
has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.
 <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> They said to him, Ask
counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go
shall be prosperous.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> The
priest said to them, Go in peace: before Yahweh is your way wherein you
go.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> Then the five men
departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they
lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure;
for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put
<I>them</I> to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians,
and had no dealings with any man.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> They came to their brothers to
Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What <I>say</I> you?
 <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> They said, Arise, and let
us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very
good: and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter in to
possess the land.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> When
you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God
has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything
that is in the earth.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> There set forth from there of
the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred
men girt with weapons of war.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> They went up, and encamped in
Kiriath Jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to
this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> They passed there to the hill
country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Then the five men who went to
spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, Do you
know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved
image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.
 <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> They turned aside there,
and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of
Micah, and asked him of his welfare.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> The six hundred men girt with
their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the
entrance of the gate.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> The five men who went to spy out
the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the
ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the
entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
 <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> When these went into
Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What do you?
 <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> They said to him, Hold
your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a
father and a priest: is it better for you to be priest to the house of one
man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> The priest's heart was glad, and
he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in
the midst of the people.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> So they turned and departed, and
put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> When they were a good way from
the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house
were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> They cried to the children of
Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you
come with such a company?  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> He said, you have taken away my
gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I
more? and how then say you to me, What ails you?  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> The children of Dan said to him,
&quot;Don't let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on
you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.&quot;
 <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> The children of Dan went
their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned
and went back to his house.  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> They took that which Micah had
made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and
secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the
city with fire.  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> There
was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings
with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built
the city, and lived therein.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> They called the name of the city
Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however
the name of the city was Laish at the first.  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> The children of Dan set up for
themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son
of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until
the day of the captivity of the land.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> So they set them up Micah's
engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in
Shiloh.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> It happened in those
days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite
sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to
him a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> His concubine played the
prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father's house to
Bethlehem Judah, and was there the space of four months.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> Her husband arose, and went after
her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with
him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father's house;
and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
 <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> His father-in-law, the
young lady's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so
they ate and drink, and lodged there.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> It happened on the fourth day,
that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the
young lady's father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a
morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> So they sat down, ate, and drank,
both of them together: and the young lady's father said to the man, Please
be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> The man rose up to depart; but
his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> He arose early in the morning on
the fifth day to depart; and the young lady's father said, Please
strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both
of them.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> When the man
rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his
father-in-law, the young lady's father, said to him, Behold, now the day
draws toward evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an
end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early
on your way, that you may go home.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> But the man wouldn't stay that
night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same
is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his
concubine also was with him.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> When they were by Jebus, the day
was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Please come and let us
turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> His master said to him, We won't
turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of
Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> He said to his servant, Come and
let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or
in Ramah.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> So they passed
on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which
belongs to Benjamin.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> They turned aside there, to go
in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of
the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.
 <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> Behold, there came an
old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the
hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the
place were Benjamites.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> He lifted up his eyes, and saw
the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Where
go you? and whence come you?  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> He said to him, We are passing
from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim;
from there am I, and I went to Bethlehem Judah: and I am <I>now</I> going
to the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.
 <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> Yet there is both straw
and provender for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me,
and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants:
there is no want of anything.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> The old man said, Peace be to
you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don't lodge in the
street.  <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> So he brought
him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their
feet, and ate and drink.  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> As they were making their hearts
merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, surrounded the
house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the
old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house, that we may
know him.  <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> The man, the
master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers,
please don't act so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house,
don't do this folly.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Behold, here is my daughter a
virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them,
and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man don't do any such
folly.  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> But the men
wouldn't listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought
her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until
the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> Then came the woman in the
dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her
lord was, until it was light.  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> Her lord rose up in the morning,
and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold,
the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her
hands on the threshold.  <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> He said to her, Up, and let us
be going; but none answered: then he took her up on the donkey; and the
man rose up, and got him to his place.  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> When he was come into his house,
he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by
limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of
Israel.  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> It was so, that
all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day
that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day:
consider it, take counsel, and speak.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Then all the children
of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from
Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
 <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> The chiefs of all the
people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the
assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew
sword.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> (Now the children
of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The
children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
 <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> The Levite, the husband
of the woman who was murdered, answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs
to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> The men of Gibeah rose against
me, and surrounded the house by night. They thought to have slain me, and
they forced my concubine, and she is dead.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> I took my concubine, and cut her
in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of
Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Behold, you children of Israel,
all of you, give here your advice and counsel.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> All the people arose as one man,
saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us
turn to his house.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> But
now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: <I>we will go up</I>
against it by lot;  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> and
we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel,
and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to
get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of
Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
 <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> So all the men of Israel
were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> The tribes of Israel sent men
through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is
happen among you?  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> Now
therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we
may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would
not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> The children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to
battle against the children of Israel.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> The children of Benjamin were
numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew
the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven
hundred chosen men.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> Among all this people there were
seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a
hair-breadth, and not miss.  <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> The men of Israel, besides
Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all
these were men of war.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> The children of Israel arose,
and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall
go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? Yahweh
said, Judah <I>shall go up</I> first.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> The children of Israel rose up
in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> The men of Israel went out to
battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array
against them at Gibeah.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> The children of Benjamin came
forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on
that day Twenty-two thousand men.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> The people, the men of Israel,
encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place
where they set themselves in array the first day.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> The children of Israel went up
and wept before Yahweh until even; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall
I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?
Yahweh said, Go up against him.  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> The children of Israel came near
against the children of Benjamin the second day.  <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> Benjamin went forth against them
out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the
children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
 <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> Then all the children of
Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat
there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until even; and they offered
burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> The children of Israel asked of
Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
 <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> and Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I
yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or
shall I cease? Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into
your hand.  <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> Israel set
ambushes all around Gibeah.  <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> The children of Israel went up
against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in
array against Gibeah, as at other times.  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> The children of Benjamin went
out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began
to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of
which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about
thirty men of Israel.  <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> The children of Benjamin said,
They are struck down before us, as at the first. But the children of
Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the
highways.  <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> All the men of
Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal
Tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even
out of Maareh Geba.  <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> There came over against Gibeah
ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but
they didn't know that evil was close on them.  <a name="C20V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:35</font></a> Yahweh struck Benjamin before
Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day
twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.  <a name="C20V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:36</font></a> So the children of Benjamin saw
that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin,
because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
 <a name="C20V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:37</font></a> The ambushers hurried,
and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck
all the city with the edge of the sword.  <a name="C20V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:38</font></a> Now the appointed sign between
the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great
cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.  <a name="C20V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:39</font></a> The men of Israel turned in the
battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about
thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as
in the first battle.  <a name="C20V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:40</font></a> But
when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the
Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up
in smoke to the sky.  <a name="C20V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:41</font></a> The
men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw
that evil had come on them.  <a name="C20V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:42</font></a> Therefore they turned their
backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the
battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities
destroyed them in its midst.  <a name="C20V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:43</font></a> They surrounded the Benjamites,
chased them, <I>and</I> trod them down at <I>their</I> resting place, as
far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise.  <a name="C20V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:44</font></a> There fell of Benjamin eighteen
thousand men; all these <I>were</I> men of valor.  <a name="C20V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:45</font></a> They turned and fled toward the
wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways
five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of
them two thousand men.  <a name="C20V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:46</font></a> So that all who fell that day of
Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these
<I>were</I> men of valor.  <a name="C20V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:47</font></a> But six hundred men turned and
fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of
Rimmon four months.  <a name="C20V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:48</font></a> The
men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them
with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and
all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on
fire.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> Now the men of Israel
had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter
to Benjamin as wife.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> The
people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted
up their voices, and wept sore.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> They said, Yahweh, the God of
Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one
tribe lacking in Israel?  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> It happened on the next day that
the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> The children of Israel said, Who
is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly
to Yahweh? For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn't come
up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> The children of Israel grieved
for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from
Israel this day.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> How
shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Yahweh
that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> They said, What one is there of
the tribes of Israel who didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah? Behold, there
came none to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> For when the people were
numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead
there.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> The congregation
sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them,
saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of
the sword, with the women and the little ones.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> This is the thing that you shall
do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain by
man.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> They found among
the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not
known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh,
which is in the land of Canaan.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> The whole congregation sent and
spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and
proclaimed peace to them.  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> Benjamin returned at that time;
and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of
Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren't enough for them.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> The people grieved for Benjamin,
because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> Then the elders of the
congregation said, How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing
the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> They said, There must be an
inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be
blotted out from Israel.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> However we may not give them
wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying,
Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> They said, Behold, there is a
feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of
Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to
Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> They commanded the children of
Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> and see, and behold, if the
daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come you out of
the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of
Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> It shall be, when their fathers
or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant
them graciously to us, because we didn't take for each man his wife in
battle, neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.
 <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> The children of Benjamin
did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those who
danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned to their
inheritance, and built the cities, and lived in them.  <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> The children of Israel departed
there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they
went out from there every man to his inheritance.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> In those days there was no king
in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
