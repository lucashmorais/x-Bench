<h1>Book 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamentations</h1>

<p>25:001:001 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is she become as a widow! she that was great among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tributary!</p>

<p>25:001:002 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her enemies.</p>

<p>25:001:003 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the straits.</p>

<p>25:001:004 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</p>

<p>25:001:005 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the enemy.</p>

<p>25:001:006 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are gone without strength before the pursuer.</p>

<p>25:001:007 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbaths.</p>

<p>25:001:008 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>

<p>25:001:009 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnified himself.</p>

<p>25:001:010 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thy congregation.</p>

<p>25:001:011 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider; for I am become vile.</p>

<p>25:001:012 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce anger.</p>

<p>25:001:013 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</p>

<p>25:001:014 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I am not able to rise up.</p>

<p>25:001:015 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah, as in a winepress.</p>

<p>25:001:016 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevailed.</p>

<p>25:001:017 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menstruous woman among them.</p>

<p>25:001:018 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</p>

<p>25:001:019 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their meat to relieve their souls.</p>

<p>25:001:020 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death.</p>

<p>25:001:021 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they shall be like unto me.</p>

<p>25:001:022 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</p>

<p>25:002:001 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anger!</p>

<p>25:002:002 The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof.</p>

<p>25:002:003 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round about.</p>

<p>25:002:004 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his fury like fire.</p>

<p>25:002:005 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lamentation.</p>

<p>25:002:006 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anger the king and the priest.</p>

<p>25:002:007 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</p>

<p>25:002:008 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wall to lament; they languished together.</p>

<p>25:002:009 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the LORD.</p>

<p>25:002:010 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p>

<p>25:002:011 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the streets of the city.</p>

<p>25:002:012 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.</p>

<p>25:002:013 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?</p>

<p>25:002:014 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;banishment.</p>

<p>25:002:015 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole earth?</p>

<p>25:002:016 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have seen it.</p>

<p>25:002:017 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine adversaries.</p>

<p>25:002:018 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</p>

<p>25:002:019 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</p>

<p>25:002:020 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord?</p>

<p>25:002:021 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not pitied.</p>

<p>25:002:022 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumed.</p>

<p>25:003:001 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrath.</p>

<p>25:003:002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light.</p>

<p>25:003:003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the day.</p>

<p>25:003:004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bones.</p>

<p>25:003:005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travail.</p>

<p>25:003:006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</p>

<p>25:003:007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my chain heavy.</p>

<p>25:003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>

<p>25:003:009 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paths crooked.</p>

<p>25:003:010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret places.</p>

<p>25:003:011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made me desolate.</p>

<p>25:003:012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>

<p>25:003:013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reins.</p>

<p>25:003:014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</p>

<p>25:003:015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with wormwood.</p>

<p>25:003:016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covered me with ashes.</p>

<p>25:003:017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prosperity.</p>

<p>25:003:018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</p>

<p>25:003:019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gall.</p>

<p>25:003:020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</p>

<p>25:003:021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</p>

<p>25:003:022 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his compassions fail not.</p>

<p>25:003:023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</p>

<p>25:003:024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in him.</p>

<p>25:003:025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeketh him.</p>

<p>25:003:026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the salvation of the LORD.</p>

<p>25:003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.</p>

<p>25:003:028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.</p>

<p>25:003:029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</p>

<p>25:003:030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with reproach.</p>

<p>25:003:031 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:</p>

<p>25:003:032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>25:003:033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>25:003:034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.</p>

<p>25:003:035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High,</p>

<p>25:003:036 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.</p>

<p>25:003:037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandeth it not?</p>

<p>25:003:038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good?</p>

<p>25:003:039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his sins?</p>

<p>25:003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</p>

<p>25:003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavens.</p>

<p>25:003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pardoned.</p>

<p>25:003:043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain, thou hast not pitied.</p>

<p>25:003:044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not pass through.</p>

<p>25:003:045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the people.</p>

<p>25:003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>

<p>25:003:047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</p>

<p>25:003:048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the daughter of my people.</p>

<p>25:003:049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intermission.</p>

<p>25:003:050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</p>

<p>25:003:051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my city.</p>

<p>25:003:052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</p>

<p>25:003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon me.</p>

<p>25:003:054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.</p>

<p>25:003:055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</p>

<p>25:003:056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at my cry.</p>

<p>25:003:057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saidst, Fear not.</p>

<p>25:003:058 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeemed my life.</p>

<p>25:003:059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</p>

<p>25:003:060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me.</p>

<p>25:003:061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imaginations against me;</p>

<p>25:003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me all the day.</p>

<p>25:003:063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;musick.</p>

<p>25:003:064 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their hands.</p>

<p>25:003:065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.</p>

<p>25:003:066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD.</p>

<p>25:004:001 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street.</p>

<p>25:004:002 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the potter!</p>

<p>25:004:003 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>

<p>25:004:004 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breaketh it unto them.</p>

<p>25:004:005 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>

<p>25:004:006 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her.</p>

<p>25:004:007 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polishing was of sapphire:</p>

<p>25:004:008 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is become like a stick.</p>

<p>25:004:009 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want of the fruits of the field.</p>

<p>25:004:010 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>25:004:011 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devoured the foundations thereof.</p>

<p>25:004:012 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>25:004:013 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her,</p>

<p>25:004:014 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their garments.</p>

<p>25:004:015 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.</p>

<p>25:004:016 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they favoured not the elders.</p>

<p>25:004:017 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</p>

<p>25:004:018 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</p>

<p>25:004:019 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wilderness.</p>

<p>25:004:020 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall live among the heathen.</p>

<p>25:004:021 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</p>

<p>25:004:022 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discover thy sins.</p>

<p>25:005:001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our reproach.</p>

<p>25:005:002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</p>

<p>25:005:003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.</p>

<p>25:005:004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.</p>

<p>25:005:005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.</p>

<p>25:005:006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p>25:005:007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniquities.</p>

<p>25:005:008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us out of their hand.</p>

<p>25:005:009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword of the wilderness.</p>

<p>25:005:010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;famine.</p>

<p>25:005:011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Judah.</p>

<p>25:005:012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not honoured.</p>

<p>25:005:013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wood.</p>

<p>25:005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;musick.</p>

<p>25:005:015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mourning.</p>

<p>25:005:016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinned!</p>

<p>25:005:017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dim.</p>

<p>25:005:018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk upon it.</p>

<p>25:005:019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to generation.</p>

<p>25:005:020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time?</p>

<p>25:005:021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our days as of old.</p>

<p>25:005:022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us.</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE, KING JAMES, B25 ***

****** This file should be named bib2510h.htm or bib2510h.zip *******

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, bib2511h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, bib2510ah.htm


This eBook was produced by David Widger
Additional credits are noted in the header.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
