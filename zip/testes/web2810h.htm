<h1>
Hosea
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh that
came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash,
king of Israel.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> When
Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, &quot;Go, take
for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for
the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> So he went and took
Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.
<p> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Yahweh said to him,
&quot;Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the
blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the
house of Israel to cease.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> It will happen in that day that I
will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> She conceived again,
and bore a daughter.
<p>Then he said to him, &quot;Call her name <a href="#N1">Lo-Ruhamah</a>;
for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in
any way pardon them.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> But I
will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their
God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or
horsemen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Now when she had weaned
Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> He said, &quot;Call his
name <a href="#N2">Lo-Ammi</a>; for you are not my people, and I will not
be yours.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Yet the number
of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be
measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where
it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of
the living God.'  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> The
children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together,
and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land;
for great will be the day of Jezreel.
<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> &quot;Say to your
brothers, <a href="#N3">'My people!'</a>
<dd>and to your sisters, <a href="#N4">'My loved one!'</a>
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Contend with your
mother!
<dd>Contend, for she is not my wife,
<dd>neither am I her husband;
<dt>and let her put away her prostitution from her face,
<dd>and her adulteries from between her breasts;
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Lest I strip her naked,
<dd>and make her bare as in the day that she was born,
<dt>and make her like a wilderness,
<dd>and set her like a dry land,
<dd>and kill her with thirst.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Indeed, on her
children I will have no mercy;
<dd>for they are children of unfaithfulness;
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> For their mother has
played the prostitute.
<dd>She who conceived them has done shamefully;
<dt>for she said, 'I will go after my lovers,
<dd>who give me my bread and my water,
<dd>my wool and my flax,
<dd>my oil and my drink.'
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Therefore, behold, I
will hedge up your way with thorns,
<dd>and I will build a wall against her,
<dd>that she can't find her way.
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> She will follow after
her lovers,
<dd>but she won't overtake them;
<dt>and she will seek them,
<dd>but won't find them.
<dt>Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband;
<dd>for then was it better with me than now.'
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> For she did not know
that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,
<dd>and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Therefore I will take
back my grain in its time,
<dd>and my new wine in its season,
<dd>and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her
nakedness.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Now I will uncover
her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
<dd>and no one will deliver her out of my hand.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> I will also cause all
her celebrations to cease:
<dd>her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> I will lay waste her
vines and her fig trees,
<dd>about which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have
given me;
<dd>and I will make them a forest,'
<dd>and the animals of the field shall eat them.
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> I will visit on her
the days of the Baals,
<dd>to which she burned incense,
<dt>when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
<dd>and went after her lovers,
<dd>and forgot me,&quot; says Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> &quot;Therefore,
behold, I will allure her,
<dd>and bring her into the wilderness,
<dd>and speak tenderly to her.
<dt> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> I will give her
vineyards from there,
<dd>and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;
<dt>and she will respond there,
<dd>as in the days of her youth,
<dd>and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
<dt> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> It will be in that
day,&quot; says Yahweh,
<dd>&quot;that you will call me 'my husband,'
<dd>and no longer call me 'my master.'
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> For I will take away
the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
<dd>and they will no longer be mentioned by name.
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> In that day I will
make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,
<dd>and with the birds of the sky,
<dd>and with the creeping things of the ground.
<dt>I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,
<dd>and will make them lie down safely.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> I will betroth you to
me forever.
<dd>Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving
kindness, and in compassion.
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> I will even betroth
you to me in faithfulness;
<dd>and you shall know Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> It will happen in
that day, I will respond,&quot; says Yahweh,
<dd>&quot;I will respond to the heavens,
<dd>and they will respond to the earth;
<dd> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> and the earth will
respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;
<dd>and they will respond to Jezreel.
<dt> <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> I will sow her to me
in the earth;
<dd>and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;
<dd>and I will tell those who were not my people, 'You are my people;'
<dd>and they will say, 'My God!'&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Yahweh said to me,
&quot;Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as
Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and
love cakes of raisins.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> So I bought her for
myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
 <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> I said to her, &quot;You
shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you
shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> For the children of
Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without
sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Afterward the children of Israel
shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall
come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days.
<p>
<dl> <dt><a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Hear the word of
Yahweh, you children of Israel;
<dd>for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:
<dt>&quot;Indeed there is no truth,
<dd>nor goodness,
<dd>nor knowledge of God in the land.
<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> There is cursing,
lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
<dd>they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Therefore the land
will mourn,
<dd>and everyone who dwells therein will waste away.
<dt>all living things in her,
<dd>even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;
<dd>yes, the fish of the sea also die.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> &quot;Yet let no man
bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those
who bring charges against a priest.
<dt> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> You will stumble in
the day,
<dd>and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;
<dd>and I will destroy your mother.
<dt> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> My people are
destroyed for lack of knowledge.
<dd>Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,
<dd>that you may be no priest to me.
<dt>Because you have forgotten your God's law,
<dd>I will also forget your children.
<dt> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> As they were
multiplied, so they sinned against me.
<dd>I will change their glory into shame.
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> They feed on the sin
of my people,
<dd>and set their heart on their iniquity.
<dt> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> It will be, like
people, like priest;
<dd>and I will punish them for their ways,
<dd>and will repay them for their deeds.
<dt> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> They will eat, and
not have enough.
<dd>They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;
<dd>because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Prostitution, wine,
and new wine take away understanding.
<dd> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> My people consult
with their wooden idol,
<dd>and answer to a stick of wood.
<dt>Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
<dd>and they have been unfaithful to their God.
<dt> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> They sacrifice on the
tops of the mountains,
<dd>and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
<dd>because its shade is good.
<dt>Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,
<dd>and your brides commit adultery.
<dt> <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> I will not punish
your daughters when they play the prostitute,
<dd>nor your brides when they commit adultery;
<dt>because the men consort with prostitutes,
<dd>and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;
<dd>so the people without understanding will come to ruin.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> &quot;Though you,
Israel, play the prostitute,
<dd>yet don't let Judah offend;
<dd>and don't come to Gilgal,
<dd>neither go up to Beth Aven,
<dd>nor swear, 'As Yahweh lives.'
<dt> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> For Israel has
behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
<dd>Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.
<dt> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Ephraim is joined to
idols.
<dd>Leave him alone!
<dt> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Their drink has
become sour.
<dd>They play the prostitute continually.
<dd>Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.
<dt> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> The wind has wrapped
her up in its wings;
<dd>and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> &quot;Listen to this,
you priests!
<dd>Listen, house of Israel,
<dd>and give ear, house of the king!
<dt>For the judgment is against you;
<dd>for you have been a snare at Mizpah,
<dd>and a net spread on Tabor.
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> The rebels are deep in
slaughter;
<dd>but I discipline all of them.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> I know Ephraim,
<dd>and Israel is not hidden from me;
<dt>for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.
<dd>Israel is defiled.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> Their deeds won't
allow them to turn to their God;
<dd>for the spirit of prostitution is within them,
<dd>and they don't know Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> The pride of Israel
testifies to his face.
<dd>Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.
<dd>Judah also will stumble with them.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> They will go with
their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh;
<dd>but they won't find him.
<dd>He has withdrawn himself from them.
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> They are unfaithful to
Yahweh;
<dd>for they have borne illegitimate children.
<dd>Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> &quot;Blow the cornet
in Gibeah,
<dd>and the trumpet in Ramah!
<dd>Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Ephraim will become a
desolation in the day of rebuke.
<dd>Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely
be.
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> The princes of Judah
are like those who remove a landmark.
<dd>I will pour out my wrath on them like water.
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Ephraim is oppressed,
<dd>he is crushed in judgment;
<dd>Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Therefore I am to
Ephraim like a moth,
<dd>and to the house of Judah like rottenness.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> &quot;When Ephraim
saw his sickness,
<dd>and Judah his wound,
<dd>Then Ephraim went to Assyria,
<dd>and sent to king Jareb:
<dt>but he is not able to heal you,
<dd>neither will he cure you of your wound.
<dt> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> For I will be to
Ephraim like a lion,
<dd>and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
<dt>I myself will tear in pieces and go away.
<dd>I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.
<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> I will go and return
to my place,
<dd>until they acknowledge their offense,
<dd>and seek my face.
<dd>In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.&quot;
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> &quot;Come, and let us
return to Yahweh;
<dd>for he has torn us to pieces,
<dd>and he will heal us;
<dt>he has injured us,
<dd>and he will bind up our wounds.
<dt> <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> After two days he will
revive us.
<dd>On the third day he will raise us up,
<dd>and we will live before him.
<dt> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Let us acknowledge
Yahweh.
<dd>Let us press on to know Yahweh.
<dt>As surely as the sun rises,
<dd>Yahweh will appear.
<dt>He will come to us like the rain,
<dd>like the spring rain that waters the earth.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> &quot;Ephraim, what
shall I do to you?
<dd>Judah, what shall I do to you?
<dd>For your love is like a morning cloud,
<dd>and like the dew that disappears early.
<dt> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Therefore I have cut
them to pieces with the prophets;
<dd>I killed them with the words of my mouth.
<dd>Your judgments are like a flash of lightning.
<dt> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> For I desire mercy,
and not sacrifice;
<dd>and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
<dt> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> But they, like Adam,
have broken the covenant.
<dd>They were unfaithful to me, there.
<dt> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Gilead is a city of
those who work iniquity;
<dd>it is stained with blood.
<dt> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> As gangs of robbers
wait to ambush a man,

<dt> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> In the house of
Israel I have seen a horrible thing.

there is a harvest appointed for you,

<dl> <dt><a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> When I would heal
Israel,

<dt> <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> On the day of our
king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.

<p>This file should be named web2810h.htm or web2810h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web2811h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web2810ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK<br>

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
