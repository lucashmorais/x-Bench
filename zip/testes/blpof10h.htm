<h3>LIST OF POETS TRANSLATED</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I.&nbsp; CHARLES D&rsquo;ORLEANS, who has sometimes, for no very
obvious reason, been styled the father of French lyric poetry, was born
in May, 1391.&nbsp; He was the son of Louis D&rsquo;Orleans, the grandson
of Charles V., and the father of Louis XII.&nbsp; Captured at Agincourt,
he was kept in England as a prisoner from 1415 to 1440, when he returned
to France, where he died in 1465.&nbsp; His verses, for the most part
roundels on two rhymes, are songs of love and spring, and retain the
allegorical forms of the Roman de la Rose.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; FRAN&Ccedil;OIS VILLON, 1431-14-?&nbsp; Nothing is known
of Villon&rsquo;s birth or death, and only too much of his life.&nbsp;
In his poems the ancient forms of French verse are animated with the
keenest sense of personal emotion, of love, of melancholy, of mocking
despair, and of repentance for a life passed in taverns and prisons.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; JOACHIM DU BELLAY, 1525-1560.&nbsp; The exact date of
Du Bellay&rsquo;s birth is unknown.&nbsp; He was certainly a little
younger than Ronsard, who was born in September, 1524, although an attempt
has been made to prove that his birth took place in 1525, as a compensation
from Nature to France for the battle of Pavia.&nbsp; As a poet Du Bellay
had the start, by a few mouths, of Ronsard; his <i>Recueil</i> was published
in 1549.&nbsp; The question of priority in the new style of poetry caused
a quarrel, which did not long separate the two singers.&nbsp; Du Bellay
is perhaps the most interesting of the Pleiad, that company of Seven,
who attempted to reform French verse, by inspiring it with the enthusiasm
of the Renaissance.&nbsp; His book <i>L&rsquo;Illustration de la langue
Fran&ccedil;aise</i> is a plea for the study of ancient models and for
the improvement of the vernacular.&nbsp; In this effort Du Bellay and
Ronsard are the predecessors of Malherbe, and of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier,
more successful through their frank eagerness than the former, less
fortunate in the possession of critical learning and appreciative taste
than the latter.&nbsp; There is something in Du Bellay&rsquo;s life,
in the artistic nature checked by occupation in affairs - he was the
secretary of Cardinal Du Bellay - in the regret and affection with which
Rome depressed and allured him, which reminds the English reader of
the thwarted career of Clough.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; REMY BELLEAU, 1528-1577.&nbsp; Du Belleau&rsquo;s life
was spent in the household of Charles de Lorraine, Marquis d&rsquo;Elboeuf,
and was marked by nothing more eventful than the usual pilgrimage to
Italy, the sacred land and sepulchre of art.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; PIERRE RONSARD, 1524-1585.&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s early years
gave little sign of his vocation.&nbsp; He was for some time a page
of the court, was in the service of James V. of Scotland, and had his
share of shipwrecks, battles, and amorous adventures.&nbsp; An illness
which produced total deafness made him a scholar and poet, as in another
age and country it might have made him a saint and an ascetic.&nbsp;
With all his industry, and almost religious zeal for art, he is one
of the poets who make themselves, rather than are born singers.&nbsp;
His epic, the Franciade, is as tedious as other artificial epics, and
his odes are almost unreadable.&nbsp; We are never allowed to forget
that he is the poet who read the Iliad through in three days.&nbsp;
He is, as has been said of Le Brun, more mythological than Pindar.&nbsp;
His constant allusion to his grey hair, an affectation which may be
noticed in Shelley, is borrowed from Anacreon.&nbsp; Many of the sonnets
in which he &lsquo;petrarquizes,&rsquo; retain the faded odour of the
roses he loved; and his songs have fire and melancholy and a sense as
of perfume from &lsquo;a closet long to quiet vowed, with mothed and
dropping arras hung.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s great fame declined
when is Malherbe came to &lsquo;bind the sweet influences of the Pleiad,&rsquo;
but he has been duly honoured by the newest school of French poetry.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; JACQUES TAHUREAU, 1527-1555.&nbsp; The amorous poetry of
Jacques Tahureau has the merit, rare in his, or in any age, of being
the real expression of passion.&nbsp; His brief life burned itself away
before he had exhausted the lyric effusion of his youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Le
plus beau gentilhomme de son si&egrave;cle, et le plus dextre &agrave;
toutes sortes de gentillesses,&rsquo; died at the age of twenty-eight,
fulfilling the presentiment which tinges, but scarcely saddens his poetry.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; JEAN PASSERAT, 1534-1602.&nbsp; Better known as a political
satirist than as a poet.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>POETS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>VICTOR HUGO.<br />ALFRED DE MUSSET, 1810-1857.<br />G&Eacute;RARD
DE NERVAL, 1801-1855.<br />HENRI MURGER, 1822-1861.</p>
<p>BALLADS.</p>
<p>The originals of the French folk-songs here translated are to be
found in the collections of MM. De Puymaigre and Gerard de Nerval, and
in the report of M. Amp&egrave;re.</p>
<p>The verses called a &lsquo;Lady of High Degree&rsquo; are imitated
from a very early <i>chanson</i> in Bartsch&rsquo;s collection.</p>
<p>The Greek ballads have been translated with the aid of the French
versions by M. Fauriel.</p>

<h3>SPRING.<br />CHARLES D&rsquo;ORLEANS, 1391-1465.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[The new-liveried year. - <i>Sir Henry Wotton</i>.]</p>
<p>The year has changed his mantle cold<br />Of wind, of rain, of bitter
air;<br />And he goes clad in cloth of gold,<br />Of laughing suns and
season fair;<br />No bird or beast of wood or wold<br />But doth with
cry or song declare<br />The year lays down his mantle cold.<br />All
founts, all rivers, seaward rolled,<br />The pleasant summer livery
wear,<br />With silver studs on broidered vair;<br />The world puts
off its raiment old,<br />The year lays down his mantle cold.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>RONDEL.<br />CHARLES D&rsquo;ORLEANS, 1391-1465.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[To his Mistress, to succour his heart that is beleaguered by jealousy.]</p>
<p>Strengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart,<br />And with some
store of pleasure give me aid,<br />For Jealousy, with all them of his
part,<br />Strong siege about the weary tower has laid.<br />Nay, if
to break his bands thou art afraid,<br />Too weak to make his cruel
force depart,<br />Strengthen at least this castle of my heart,<br />And
with some store of pleasure give me aid.<br />Nay, let not Jealousy,
for all his art<br />Be master, and the tower in ruin laid,<br />That
still, ah Love! thy gracious rule obeyed.<br />Advance, and give me
succour of thy part;<br />Strengthen, my Love, this castle of my heart.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>RONDEL.<br />FRANCOIS VILLON, 1460</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Goodbye! the tears are in my eyes;<br />Farewell, farewell, my prettiest;<br />Farewell,
of women born the best;<br />Good-bye! the saddest of good-byes.<br />Farewell!
with many vows and sighs<br />My sad heart leaves you to your rest;<br />Farewell!
the tears are in my eyes;<br />Farewell! from you my miseries<br />Are
more than now may be confessed,<br />And most by thee have I been blessed,<br />Yea,
and for thee have wasted sighs;<br />Goodbye! the last of my goodbyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>ARBOR AMORIS.<br />FRANCOIS VILLON, 1460</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I have a tree, a graft of Love,<br />That in my heart has taken root;<br />Sad
are the buds and blooms thereof,<br />And bitter sorrow is its fruit;<br />Yet,
since it was a tender shoot,<br />So greatly hath its shadow spread,<br />That
underneath all joy is dead,<br />And all my pleasant days are flown,<br />Nor
can I slay it, nor instead<br />Plant any tree, save this alone.</p>
<p>Ah, yet, for long and long enough<br />My tears were rain about its
root,<br />And though the fruit be harsh thereof,<br />I scarcely looked
for better fruit<br />Than this, that carefully I put<br />In garner,
for the bitter bread<br />Whereon my weary life is fed:<br />Ah, better
were the soil unsown<br />That bears such growths; but Love instead<br />Will
plant no tree, but this alone.</p>
<p>Ah, would that this new spring, whereof<br />The leaves and flowers
flush into shoot,<br />I might have succour and aid of Love,<br />To
prune these branches at the root,<br />That long have borne such bitter
fruit,<br />And graft a new bough, comforted<br />With happy blossoms
white and red;<br />So pleasure should for pain atone,<br />Nor Love
slay this tree, nor instead<br />Plant any tree, but this alone.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;ENVOY.</p>
<p>Princess, by whom my hope is fed,<br />My heart thee prays in lowlihead<br />To
prune the ill boughs overgrown,<br />Nor slay Love&rsquo;s tree, nor
plant instead<br />Another tree, save this alone.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>BALLAD OF THE GIBBET.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[An epitaph in the form of a ballad that Fran&ccedil;ois Villon wrote
of himself and his company, they expecting shortly to be hanged.]</p>
<p>Brothers and men that shall after us be,<br />Let not your hearts
be hard to us:<br />For pitying this our misery<br />Ye shall find God
the more piteous.<br />Look on us six that are hanging thus,<br />And
for the flesh that so much we cherished<br />How it is eaten of birds
and perished,<br />And ashes and dust fill our bones&rsquo; place,<br />Mock
not at us that so feeble be,<br />But pray God pardon us out of His
grace.</p>
<p>Listen, we pray you, and look not in scorn,<br />Though justly, in
sooth, we are cast to die;<br />Ye wot no man so wise is born<br />That
keeps his wisdom constantly.<br />Be ye then merciful, and cry<br />To
Mary&rsquo;s Son that is piteous,<br />That His mercy take no stain
from us,<br />Saving us out of the fiery place.<br />We are but dead,
let no soul deny<br />To pray God succour us of His grace.</p>
<p>The rain out of heaven has washed us clean,<br />The sun has scorched
us black and bare,<br />Ravens and rooks have pecked at our eyne,<br />And
feathered their nests with our beards and hair.<br />Round are we tossed,
and here and there,<br />This way and that, at the wild wind&rsquo;s
will,<br />Never a moment my body is still;<br />Birds they are busy
about my face.<br />Live not as we, nor fare as we fare;<br />Pray God
pardon us out of His grace.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;ENVOY.</p>
<p>Prince Jesus, Master of all, to thee<br />We pray Hell gain no mastery,<br />That
we come never anear that place;<br />And ye men, make no mockery,<br />Pray
God pardon us out of His grace.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>HYMN TO THE WINDS.<br />DU BELLAY, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[The winds are invoked by the winnowers of corn.]</p>
<p>To you, troop so fleet,<br />That with winged wandering feet,<br />Through
the wide world pass,<br />And with soft murmuring<br />Toss the green
shades of spring<br />In woods and grass,<br />Lily and violet<br />I
give, and blossoms wet,<br />Roses and dew;<br />This branch of blushing
roses,<br />Whose fresh bud uncloses,<br />Wind-flowers too.<br />Ah,
winnow with sweet breath,<br />Winnow the holt and heath,<br />Round
this retreat;<br />Where all the golden morn<br />We fan the gold o&rsquo;
the corn,<br />In the sun&rsquo;s heat.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A VOW TO HEAVENLY VENUS.<br />DU BELLAY, 1500</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>We that with like hearts love, we lovers twain,<br />New wedded in
the village by thy fane,<br />Lady of all chaste love, to thee it is<br />We
bring these amaranths, these white lilies,<br />A sign, and sacrifice;
may Love, we pray,<br />Like amaranthine flowers, feel no decay;<br />Like
these cool lilies may our loves remain,<br />Perfect and pure, and know
not any stain;<br />And be our hearts, from this thy holy hour,<br />Bound
each to each, like flower to wedded flower.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>TO HIS FRIEND IN ELYSIUM.<br />DU BELLAY, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>So long you wandered on the dusky plain,<br />Where flit the shadows
with their endless cry,<br />You reach the shore where all the world
goes by,<br />You leave the strife, the slavery, the pain;<br />But
we, but we, the mortals that remain<br />In vain stretch hands; for
Charon sullenly<br />Drives us afar, we may not come anigh<br />Till
that last mystic obolus we gain.</p>
<p>But you are happy in the quiet place,<br />And with the learned lovers
of old days,<br />And with your love, you wander ever-more<br />In the
dim woods, and drink forgetfulness<br />Of us your friends, a weary
crowd that press<br />About the gate, or labour at the oar.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A SONNET TO HEAVENLY BEAUTY.<br />DU BELLAY, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If this our little life is but a day<br />In the Eternal, - if the
years in vain<br />Toil after hours that never come again, -<br />If
everything that hath been must decay,<br />Why dreamest thou of joys
that pass away,<br />My soul, that my sad body doth restrain?<br />Why
of the moment&rsquo;s pleasure art thou fain?<br />Nay, thou hast wings,
- nay, seek another stay.</p>
<p>There is the joy whereto each soul aspires,<br />And there the rest
that all the world desires,<br />And there is love, and peace, and gracious
mirth;<br />And there in the most highest heavens shalt thou<br />Behold
the Very Beauty, whereof now<br />Thou worshippest the shadow upon earth.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>APRIL.<br />REMY BELLEAU, 1560.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>April, pride of woodland ways,<br />Of glad days,<br />April, bringing
hope of prime,<br />To the young flowers that beneath<br />Their bud
sheath<br />Are guarded in their tender time;</p>
<p>April, pride of fields that be<br />Green and free,<br />That in
fashion glad and gay,<br />Stud with flowers red and blue,<br />Every
hue,<br />Their jewelled spring array;</p>
<p>April, pride of murmuring<br />Winds of spring,<br />That beneath
the winnowed air,<br />Trap with subtle nets and sweet<br />Flora&rsquo;s
feet,<br />Flora&rsquo;s feet, the fleet and fair;</p>
<p>April, by thy hand caressed,<br />From her breast<br />Nature scatters
everywhere<br />Handfuls of all sweet perfumes,<br />Buds and blooms,<br />Making
faint the earth and air.</p>
<p>April, joy of the green hours,<br />Clothes with flowers<br />Over
all her locks of gold<br />My sweet Lady; and her breast<br />With the
blest<br />Birds of summer manifold.</p>
<p>April, with thy gracious wiles,<br />Like the smiles,<br />Smiles
of Venus; and thy breath<br />Like her breath, the Gods&rsquo; delight,<br />(From
their height<br />They take the happy air beneath;)</p>
<p>It is thou that, of thy grace,<br />From their place<br />In the
far-oft isles dost bring<br />Swallows over earth and sea,<br />Glad
to be<br />Messengers of thee, and Spring.</p>
<p>Daffodil and eglantine,<br />And woodbine,<br />Lily, violet, and
rose<br />Plentiful in April fair,<br />To the air,<br />Their pretty
petals do unclose.</p>
<p>Nightingales ye now may hear,<br />Piercing clear,<br />Singing in
the deepest shade;<br />Many and many a babbled note<br />Chime and
float,<br />Woodland music through the glade.</p>
<p>April, all to welcome thee,<br />Spring sets free<br />Ancient flames,
and with low breath<br />Wakes the ashes grey and old<br />That the
cold<br />Chilled within our hearts to death.</p>
<p>Thou beholdest in the warm<br />Hours, the swarm<br />Of the thievish
bees, that flies<br />Evermore from bloom to bloom<br />For perfume,<br />Hid
away in tiny thighs.</p>
<p>Her cool shadows May can boast,<br />Fruits almost<br />Ripe, and
gifts of fertile dew,<br />Manna-sweet and honey-sweet,<br />That complete<br />Her
flower garland fresh and new.</p>
<p>Nay, but I will give my praise,<br />To these days,<br />Named with
the glad name of Her <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a><br />That
from out the foam o&rsquo; the sea<br />Came to be<br />Sudden light
on earth and air.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>ROSES.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I send you here a wreath of blossoms blown,<br />And woven flowers
at sunset gathered,<br />Another dawn had seen them ruined, and shed<br />Loose
leaves upon the grass at random strown.<br />By this, their sure example,
be it known,<br />That all your beauties, now in perfect flower,<br />Shall
fade as these, and wither in an hour,<br />Flowerlike, and brief of
days, as the flower sown.</p>
<p>Ah, time is flying, lady - time is flying;<br />Nay, &rsquo;tis not
time that flies but we that go,<br />Who in short space shall be in
churchyard lying,<br />And of our loving parley none shall know,<br />Nor
any man consider what we were;<br />Be therefore kind, my love, whiles
thou art fair.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE ROSE.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>See, Mignonne, hath not the Rose,<br />That this morning did unclose<br />Her
purple mantle to the light,<br />Lost, before the day be dead,<br />The
glory of her raiment red,<br />Her colour, bright as yours is bright?</p>
<p>Ah, Mignonne, in how few hours,<br />The petals of her purple flowers<br />All
have faded, fallen, died;<br />Sad Nature, mother ruinous,<br />That
seest thy fair child perish thus<br />&lsquo;Twixt matin song and even
tide.</p>
<p>Hear me, my darling, speaking sooth,<br />Gather the fleet flower
of your youth,<br />Take ye your pleasure at the best;<br />Be merry
ere your beauty flit,<br />For length of days will tarnish it<br />Like
roses that were loveliest.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>TO THE MOON.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Hide this one night thy crescent, kindly Moon;<br />So shall Endymion
faithful prove, and rest<br />Loving and unawakened on thy breast;<br />So
shall no foul enchanter importune<br />Thy quiet course; for now the
night is boon,<br />And through the friendly night unseen I fare,<br />Who
dread the face of foemen unaware,<br />And watch of hostile spies in
the bright noon.<br />Thou knowest, Moon, the bitter power of Love;<br />&rsquo;Tis
told how shepherd Pan found ways to move,<br />For little price, thy
heart; and of your grace,<br />Sweet stars, be kind to this not alien
fire,<br />Because on earth ye did not scorn desire,<br />Bethink ye,
now ye hold your heavenly place.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>TO HIS YOUNG MISTRESS.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fair flower of fifteen springs, that still<br />Art scarcely blossomed
from the bud,<br />Yet hast such store of evil will,<br />A heart so
full of hardihood,<br />Seeking to hide in friendly wise<br />The mischief
of your mocking eyes.</p>
<p>If you have pity, child, give o&rsquo;er;<br />Give back the heart
you stole from me,<br />Pirate, setting so little store<br />On this
your captive from Love&rsquo;s sea,<br />Holding his misery for gain,<br />And
making pleasure of his pain.</p>
<p>Another, not so fair of face,<br />But far more pitiful than you,<br />Would
take my heart, if of his grace,<br />My heart would give her of Love&rsquo;s
due;<br />And she shall have it, since I find<br />That you are cruel
and unkind.</p>
<p>Nay, I would rather that it died,<br />Within your white hands prisoning,<br />Would
rather that it still abide<br />In your ungentle comforting.<br />Than
change its faith, and seek to her<br />That is more kind, but not so
fair.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>DEADLY KISSES.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>All take these lips away; no more,<br />No more such kisses give
to me.<br />My spirit faints for joy; I see<br />Through mists of death
the dreamy shore,<br />And meadows by the water-side,<br />Where all
about the Hollow Land<br />Fare the sweet singers that have died,<br />With
their lost ladies, hand in hand;<br />Ah, Love, how fireless are their
eyes,<br />How pale their lips that kiss and smile!<br />So mine must
be in little while<br />If thou wilt kiss me in such wise.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>OF HIS LADY&rsquo;S OLD AGE.<br />RONSARD, 1550</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When you are very old, at evening<br />You&rsquo;ll sit and spin
beside the fire, and say,<br />Humming my songs, &lsquo;Ah well, ah
well-a-day!<br />When I was young, of me did Ronsard sing.&rsquo;<br />None
of your maidens that doth hear the thing,<br />Albeit with her weary
task foredone,<br />But wakens at my name, and calls you one<br />Blest,
to be held in long remembering.</p>
<p>I shall be low beneath the earth, and laid<br />On sleep, a phantom
in the myrtle shade,<br />While you beside the fire, a grandame grey,<br />My
love, your pride, remember and regret;<br />Ah, love me, love! we may
be happy yet,<br />And gather roses, while &rsquo;tis called to-day.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>ON HIS LADY&rsquo;S WAKING.<br />RONSARD, 1550</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My lady woke upon a morning fair,<br />What time Apollo&rsquo;s chariot
takes the skies,<br />And, fain to fill with arrows from her eyes<br />His
empty quiver, Love was standing there:<br />I saw two apples that her
breast doth bear<br />None such the close of the Hesperides<br />Yields;
nor hath Venus any such as these,<br />Nor she that had of nursling
Mars the care.</p>
<p>Even such a bosom, and so fair it was,<br />Pure as the perfect work
of Phidias,<br />That sad Andromeda&rsquo;s discomfiture<br />Left bare,
when Perseus passed her on a day,<br />And pale as Death for fear of
Death she lay,<br />With breast as marble cold, as marble pure.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>HIS LADY&rsquo;S DEATH.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Twain that were foes, while Mary lived, are fled;<br />One laurel-crowned
abides in heaven, and one<br />Beneath the earth has fared, a fallen
sun,<br />A light of love among the loveless dead.<br />The first is
Chastity, that vanquished<br />The archer Love, that held joint empery<br />With
the sweet beauty that made war on me,<br />When laughter of lips with
laughing eyes was wed.</p>
<p>Their strife the Fates have closed, with stern control,<br />The
earth holds her fair body, and her soul<br />An angel with glad angels
triumpheth;<br />Love has no more that he can do; desire<br />Is buried,
and my heart a faded fire,<br />And for Death&rsquo;s sake, I am in
love with Death.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LADY&rsquo;S TOMB.<br />RONSARD, 1550.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As in the gardens, all through May, the rose,<br />Lovely, and young,
and fair apparelled,<br />Makes sunrise jealous of her rosy red,<br />When
dawn upon the dew of dawning glows;<br />Graces and Loves within her
breast repose,<br />The woods are faint with the sweet odour shed,<br />Till
rains and heavy suns have smitten dead<br />The languid flower, and
the loose leaves unclose, -</p>
<p>So this, the perfect beauty of our days,<br />When earth and heaven
were vocal of her praise,<br />The fates have slain, and her sweet soul
reposes;<br />And tears I bring, and sighs, and on her tomb<br />Pour
milk, and scatter buds of many a bloom,<br />That dead, as living, she
may be with roses.</p>

<h3>SHADOWS OF HIS LADY.<br />JACQUES TAHUREAU, 1527-1555.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Within the sand of what far river lies<br />The gold that gleams
in tresses of my Love?<br />What highest circle of the Heavens above<br />Is
jewelled with such stars as are her eyes?<br />And where is the rich
sea whose coral vies<br />With her red lips, that cannot kiss enough?<br />What
dawn-lit garden knew the rose, whereof<br />The fled soul lives in her
cheeks&rsquo; rosy guise?</p>
<p>What Parian marble that is loveliest,<br />Can match the whiteness
of her brow and breast?<br />When drew she breath from the Sabaean glade?<br />Oh
happy rock and river, sky and sea,<br />Gardens, and glades Sabaean,
all that be<br />The far-off splendid semblance of my maid!</p>

<h3>MOONLIGHT.<br />JACQUES TAHUREAU, 1527-1555.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The high Midnight was garlanding her head<br />With many a shining
star in shining skies,<br />And, of her grace, a slumber on mine eyes,<br />And,
after sorrow, quietness was shed.<br />Far in dim fields cicalas jargon&eacute;d<br />A
thin shrill clamour of complaints and cries;<br />And all the woods
were pallid, in strange wise,<br />With pallor of the sad moon overspread.</p>
<p>Then came my lady to that lonely place,<br />And, from her palfrey
stooping, did embrace<br />And hang upon my neck, and kissed me over;<br />Wherefore
the day is far less dear than night,<br />And sweeter is the shadow
than the light,<br />Since night has made me such a happy lover.</p>

<h3>LOVE IN MAY.<br />PASSERAT, 1580.</h3>

<p>Off with sleep, love, up from bed,<br />This fair morn;<br />See,
for our eyes the rosy red<br />New dawn is born;<br />Now that skies
are glad and gay<br />In this gracious month of May,<br />Love me, sweet,<br />Fill
my joy in brimming measure,<br />In this world he hath no pleasure,<br />That
will none of it.</p>
<p>Come, love, through the woods of spring,<br />Come walk with me;<br />Listen,
the sweet birds jargoning<br />From tree to tree.<br />List and listen,
over all<br />Nightingale most musical<br />That ceases never;<br />Grief
begone, and let us be<br />For a space as glad as he;<br />Time&rsquo;s
flitting ever.</p>
<p>Old Time, that loves not lovers, wears<br />Wings swift in flight;<br />All
our happy life he bears<br />Far in the night.<br />Old and wrinkled
on a day,<br />Sad and weary shall you say,<br />&lsquo;Ah, fool was
I,<br />That took no pleasure in the grace<br />Of the flower that from
my face<br />Time has seen die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leave then sorrow, teen, and tears<br />Till we be old;<br />Young
we are, and of our years<br />Till youth be cold<br />Pluck the flower;
while spring is gay<br />In this happy month of May,<br />Love me, love;<br />Fill
our joy in brimming measure;<br />In this world he hath no pleasure<br />That
will none thereof.</p>

fly, and peep and hide,<br />With muffled music, murmured far and wide!<br />Ah,
Spring time, when we think of all the lays<br />That dreamy lovers send
to dreamy mays,<br />Of the fond hearts within a billet bound,<br />Of
all the soft silk paper that pens wound,<br />The messages of love that
mortals write<br />Filled with intoxication of delight,<br />Written
in April, and before the May time<br />Shredded and flown, play things
for the wind&rsquo;s play-time,<br />We dream that all white butterflies
above,<br />Who seek through clouds or waters souls to love,<br />And
leave their lady mistress in despair,<br />To flit to flowers, as kinder
and more fair,<br />Are but torn love-letters, that through the skies<br />Flutter,

<p>Since it was given to me to hear one happy while,<br />The words
wherein your heart spoke all its mysteries,<br />Since I have seen you
weep, and since I have seen you smile,<br />Your lips upon my lips,
and your eyes upon my eyes;</p>
<p>Since I have known above my forehead glance and gleam,<br />A ray,
a single ray, of your star, veiled always,<br />Since I have felt the
fall, upon my lifetime&rsquo;s stream,<br />Of one rose petal plucked
from the roses of your days;</p>
<p>I now am bold to say to the swift changing hours,<br />Pass, pass
upon your way, for I grow never old,<br />Fleet to the dark abysm with
all your fading flowers,<br />One rose that none may pluck, within my
heart I hold.</p>
<p>Your flying wings may smite, but they can never spill<br />The cup
fulfilled of love, from which my lips are wet;<br />My heart has far

<p>Whene&rsquo;er I hear that music vague and old,<br />Two hundred

I behold<br />A green land golden in the dying day.</p>
<p>An old red castle, strong with stony towers,<br />The windows gay
with many coloured glass;<br />Wide plains, and rivers flowing among
flowers,<br />That bathe the castle basement as they pass.</p>

were blest?</p>
<p>Ah lady, when we think of this,<br />The foolish hours of youth and
bliss,<br />How fleet, how sweet, how hard to hold!<br />How old we
are, ere spring be green!<br />You touch the limit of eighteen<br />And
I am twenty winters old.</p>

she is!<br />Yet keeps the beauty of her prime;<br />Child, never Spanish
lady&rsquo;s face<br />Was lovely with so wild a grace;<br />Remember
the dead summer time.</p>
<p>Think of our loves, our feuds of old,<br />And how you gave your
chain of gold<br />To me for a peace offering;<br />And how all night
I lay awake<br />To touch and kiss it for your sake, -<br />To touch
and kiss the lifeless thing.</p>
<p>Lady, beware, for all we say,<br />This Love shall live another day,<br />Awakened
from his deathly sleep;<br />The heart that once has been your shrine<br />For
other loves is too divine;<br />A home, my dear, too wide and deep.</p>
<p>What did I say - why do I dream?<br />Why should I struggle with
the stream<br />Whose waves return not any day?<br />Close heart, and
eyes, and arms from me;<br />Farewell, farewell! so must it be,<br />So
runs, so runs, the world away,</p>
<p>The season bears upon its wing<br />The swallows and the songs of
spring,<br />And days that were, and days that flit;<br />The loved
lost hours are far away;<br />And hope and fame are scattered spray<br />For
me, that gave you love a day<br />For you that not remember it.</p>

in sweet air the light vane sets,<br />The weathercocks all southward
twirl;<br />A sou will buy her violets<br />And make Nini a happy girl.</p>
<p>The winter to the poor was sore,<br />Counting the weary winter days,<br />Watching

now his last log dimly gleamed,<br />Lighting the room with feeble glare,<br />Half
cinder and half smoke it seemed<br />That the wind wafted into air.</p>
<p>Pilgrims from ocean and far isles<br />See where the east is reddening,<br />The
flocks that fly a thousand miles<br />From sunsetting to sunsetting;<br />Look
up, look out, behold the swallows,<br />The throats that twitter, the

in the summer life is sweet.</p>

gay?<br />My garret - near the sky &rsquo;twas set -<br />The April

whispered they were fairest seen<br />Through no cloud-veil?&nbsp; Remember,
love!<br />Do you remember, love Christine?</p>

<h3>MUSETTE.<br />HENRI MURGER.&nbsp; 1850</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Yesterday, watching the swallows&rsquo; flight<br />That bring the
spring and the season fair,<br />A moment I thought of the beauty bright<br />Who
loved me, when she had time to spare;<br />And dreamily, dreamily all
the day,<br />I mused on the calendar of the year,<br />The year so
near and so far away,<br />When you were lief, and when I was dear.</p>
<p>Your memory has not had time to pass;<br />My youth has days of its
lifetime yet;<br />If you only knocked at the door, alas,<br />My heart
would open the door, Musette!<br />Still at your name must my sad heart
beat;<br />Ah Muse, ah maiden of faithlessness!<br />Return for a moment,
and deign to eat<br />The bread that pleasure was wont to bless.</p>
<p>The tables and curtains, the chairs and all,<br />Friends of our
pleasure that looked on our pain,<br />Are glad with the gladness of
festival,<br />Hoping to see you at home again;<br />Come, let the days
of their mourning pass,<br />The silent friends that are sad for you
yet;<br />The little sofa, the great wine glass -<br />For know you
had often my share, Musette.</p>
<p>Come, you shall wear the raiment white<br />You wore of old, when
the world was gay,<br />We will wander in woods of the heart&rsquo;s
delight<br />The whole of the Sunday holiday.<br />Come, we will sit
by the wayside inn,<br />Come, and your song will gain force to fly,<br />Dipping
its wing in the clear and thin<br />Wine, as of old, ere it scale the
sky.</p>
<p>Musette, who had scarcely forgotten withal<br />One beautiful dawn
of the new year&rsquo;s best,<br />Returned at the end of the carnival,<br />A
flown bird, to a forsaken nest.<br />Ah faithless and fair!&nbsp; I
embrace her yet,<br />With no heart-beat, and with never a sigh;<br />And
Musette, no longer the old Musette,<br />Declares that I am no longer
I.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear that was once so dear,<br />Dead with the death
of our latest love;<br />Our youth is laid in its sepulchre,<br />The
calendar stands for a stone above.<br />&rsquo;Tis only in searching
the dust of the days,<br />The ashes of all old memories,<br />That
we find the key of the woodland ways<br />That lead to the place of
our paradise.</p>

<h3>THE THREE CAPTAINS.</h3>

<p>All beneath the white-rose tree<br />Walks a lady fair to see,<br />She
is as white as the snows,<br />She is as fair as the day:<br />From
her father&rsquo;s garden close<br />Three knights have ta&rsquo;en
her away.</p>
<p>He has ta&rsquo;en her by the hand,<br />The youngest of the three
-<br />&lsquo;Mount and ride, my bonnie bride,<br />On my white horse
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And ever they rode, and better rode,<br />Till they came to Senlis
town,<br />The hostess she looked hard at them<br />As they were lighting
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are ye here by force,&rsquo; she said,<br />&lsquo;Or
are ye here for play?<br />From out my father&rsquo;s garden close<br />Three
knights me stole away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And fain would I win back,&rsquo; she said,<br />&lsquo;The
weary way I come;<br />And fain would see my father dear,<br />And fain
go maiden home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, weep not, lady fair,&rsquo; said she,<br />&lsquo;You
shall win back,&rsquo; she said,<br />&lsquo;For you shall take this
draught from me<br />Will make you lie for dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in and sup, fair lady,&rsquo; they said,<br />&lsquo;Come
busk ye and be bright;<br />It is with three bold captains<br />That
ye must be this night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they had eaten well and drunk,<br />She fell down like one slain:<br />&lsquo;Now,
out and alas! for my bonny may<br />Shall live no more again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Within her father&rsquo;s garden stead<br />There are three
white lilies;<br />With her body to the lily bed,<br />With her soul
to Paradise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They bore her to her father&rsquo;s house,<br />They bore her all
the three,<br />They laid her in her father&rsquo;s close,<br />Beneath
the white-rose tree.</p>
<p>She had not lain a day, a day,<br />A day but barely three,<br />When
the may awakes, &lsquo;Oh, open, father,<br />Oh, open the door for
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis I have lain for dead, father,<br />Have lain the
long days three,<br />That I might maiden come again<br />To my mother

dare to dance with thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Margaret&rsquo;s gone within her bower<br />Put ashes in her
hair,<br />And sackcloth on her bonny breast,<br />And on her shoulders
bare.</p>
<p>There came a knock to her bower door,<br />And blithe she let him
in;<br />It was her brother from the wars,<br />The dearest of her kin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Set gold within your hair, Margaret,<br />Set gold within
your hair,<br />And gold upon your girdle band,<br />And on your breast
so fair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For we are bidden to dance to-night,<br />We may not bide
away;<br />This one good night, this one fair night,<br />Before the
red new day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, no gold for my head brother,<br />Nay, no gold for my
hair;<br />It is the ashes and dust of earth<br />That you and I must
wear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No gold work for my girdle band,<br />No gold work on my feet;<br />But
ashes of the fire, my love,<br />But dust that the serpents eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>They danced across the bridge of Death,<br />Above the black water,<br />And
the marriage-bell was tolled in hell<br />For the souls of him and her.</p>

wan?<br />Is it for a cast of bitter love,<br />Or for a false leman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not for a false lover<br />That I go sad to see;<br />But

always on the ninth midnight<br />I change to a milk white doe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I have hunted the wild deer<br />In east lands and in

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was a maid lay sick of love,<br />All for a leman fair;<br />And
it was three of her bower-maidens<br />That came to comfort her.</p>
<p>The first she bore a blossomed branch,<br />The second an apple brown,<br />The
third she had a silk kerchief,<br />And still her tears ran down.</p>
<p>The first she mocked, the second she laughed -<br />&lsquo;We have
loved lemans fair,<br />We made our hearts like the iron stone<br />Had
little teen or care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ye have loved &rsquo;twas a false false love,<br />And
an ill leman was he;<br />But her true love had angel&rsquo;s eyes,<br />And
as fair was his sweet body.</p>
<p>And I will gird my green kirtle,<br />And braid my yellow hair,<br />And
I will over the high hills<br />And bring her love to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, if you braid your yellow hair,<br />You&rsquo;ll twine
my love from me.&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;Now nay, now nay, my lady good,<br />That
ever this should be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you have crossed the western hills<br />My true love
you shall meet,<br />With a green flag blowing over him,<br />And green
grass at his feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She has crossed over the high hills,<br />And the low hills between,<br />And
she has found the may&rsquo;s leman<br />Beneath a flag of green.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas four and twenty ladies fair<br />Were sitting on the
grass;<br />But he has turned and looked on her,<br />And will not let
her pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve maidens here, and maidens there,<br />And loves
through all the land;<br />But what have you made of the lady fair<br />You
gave the rose-garland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so harsh and cold of love,<br />To me gave little grace;<br />She
wept if I but touched her hand,<br />Or kissed her bonny face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, crows shall build in the eagle&rsquo;s nest,<br />The
hawk the dove shall wed,<br />Before my old true love and I<br />Meet
in one wedding bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she had heard his bitter rede<br />That was his old true love,<br />She
sat and wept within her bower,<br />And moaned even as a dove.</p>
<p>She rose up from her window seat,<br />And she looked out to see;<br />Her
love came riding up the street<br />With a goodly company.</p>
<p>He was clad on with Venice gold,<br />Wrought upon cramoisie,<br />His
yellow hair shone like the sun<br />About his fair body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now shall I call him blossomed branch<br />That has ill knots
therein?<br />Or shall I call him basil plant,<br />That comes of an
evil kin?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I shall give him goodly names,<br />My sword of damask
fine;<br />My silver flower, my bright-winged bird,<br />Where go you,
lover mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I go to marry my new bride,<br />That I bring o&rsquo;er the
down;<br />And you shall be her bridal maid,<br />And hold her bridal
crown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you come to the bride chamber<br />Where your fair maiden
is,<br />You&rsquo;ll tell her I was fair of face,<br />But never tell
her this,</p>
<p>&lsquo;That still my lips were lips of love,<br />My kiss love&rsquo;s
spring-water,<br />That my love was a running spring,<br />My breast
a garden fair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have kissed the lips of love<br />And drained the
well-water,<br />And you have spoiled the running spring,<br />And robbed
the fruits so fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now he that will may scatter nuts,<br />And he may wed that
will;<br />But she that was my old true love<br />Shall be my true love
still.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All the maidens were merry and wed<br />All to lovers so fair to

love and me.</p>
<p>I spoke to him and he noting said,<br />I gave him bread of the wheat
so fine,<br />He did not eat of the bridal bread,<br />He did not drink
of the bridal wine.</p>
<p>I made him a bed was soft and deep,<br />I made him a bed to sleep

<p>All in the mirk midnight when I was beside you,<br />Who has seen,

and the light of the stars that espied you,<br />The fall of the moon,
and the dawning begun.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a swift star has fallen, a star that discovers<br />To
the sea what the green sea has told to the oars,<br />And the oars to
the sailors, and they of us lovers<br />Go singing this song at their
mistress&rsquo;s doors.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Three crests against the saffron sky,<br />Beyond the purple plain,<br />The
dear remembered melody<br />Of Tweed once more again.</p>
<p>Wan water from the border hills,<br />Dear voice from the old years,<br />Thy
distant music lulls and stills,<br />And moves to quiet tears.</p>
<p>Like a loved ghost thy fabled flood<br />Fleets through the dusky
land;<br />Where Scott, come home to die, has stood,<br />My feet returning
stand.</p>
<p>A mist of memory broods and floats,<br />The border waters flow;<br />The
air is full of ballad notes,<br />Borne out of long ago.</p>
<p>Old songs that sung themselves to me,<br />Sweet through a boy&rsquo;s
day dream,<br />While trout below the blossom&rsquo;d tree<br />Plashed
in the golden stream.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>Twilight, and Tweed, and Eildon Hill,<br />Fair and thrice fair you
be;<br />You tell me that the voice is still<br />That should have welcomed

<h3>ONE FLOWER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[&ldquo;Up there shot a lily red,<br />With a patch of earth from
the land of the dead,<br />For she was strong in the land of the dead.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>When autumn suns are soft, and sea winds moan,<br />And golden fruits
make sweet the golden air,<br />In gardens where the apple blossoms
were,<br />In these old springs before I walked alone;<br />I pass among
the pathways overgrown,<br />Of all the former flowers that kissed your
feet<br />Remains a poppy, pallid from the heat,<br />A wild poppy that
the wild winds have sown.<br />Alas! the rose forgets your hands of
rose;<br />The lilies slumber in the lily bed;<br />&rsquo;Tis only
poppies in the dreamy close,<br />The changeless, windless garden of
the dead,<br />You tend, with buds soft as your kiss that lies<br />In
over happy dreams, upon mine eyes.</p>

<h3>METEMPSYCHOSIS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I shall not see thee, nay, but I shall know<br />Perchance, thy grey
eyes in another&rsquo;s eyes,<br />Shall guess thy curls in gracious
locks that flow<br />On purest brows, yea, and the swift surmise<br />Shall
follow, and track, and find thee in disguise<br />Of all sad things,
and fair, where sunsets glow,<br />When through the scent of heather,
faint and low,<br />The weak wind whispers to the day that dies.</p>
<p>From all sweet art, and out of all &lsquo;old rhyme,&rsquo;<br />Thine
eyes and lips are light and song to me;<br />The shadows of the beauty
of all time,<br />Carven and sung, are only shapes of thee;<br />Alas,
the shadowy shapes! ah, sweet my dear<br />Shall life or death bring
all thy being near?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LOST IN HADES.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I dreamed that somewhere in the shadowy place,<br />Grief of farewell
unspoken was forgot<br />In welcome, and regret remembered not;<br />And
hopeless prayer accomplished turned to praise<br />On lips that had
been songless many days;<br />Hope had no more to hope for, and desire<br />And
dread were overpast, in white attire<br />New born we walked among the
new world&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>Then from the press of shades a spirit threw<br />Towards me such
apples as these gardens bear;<br />And turning, I was &lsquo;ware of
her, and knew<br />And followed her fleet voice and flying hair, -<br />Followed,
and found her not, and seeking you<br />I found you never, dearest,
anywhere.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A STAR IN THE NIGHT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The perfect piteous beauty of thy face,<br />Is like a star the dawning
drives away;<br />Mine eyes may never see in the bright day<br />Thy
pallid halo, thy supernal grace:<br />But in the night from forth the
silent place<br />Thou comest, dim in dreams, as doth a stray<br />Star
of the starry flock that in the grey<br />Is seen, and lost, and seen
a moment&rsquo;s space.</p>
<p>And as the earth at night turns to a star,<br />Loved long ago, and
dearer than the sun,<br />So in the spiritual place afar,<br />At night
our souls are mingled and made one,<br />And wait till one night fall,
and one dawn rise,<br />That brings no noon too splendid for your eyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A SUNSET ON YARROW.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The wind and the day had lived together,<br />They died together,
and far away<br />Spoke farewell in the sultry weather,<br />Out of
the sunset, over the heather,<br />The dying wind and the dying day.</p>
<p>Far in the south, the summer levin<br />Flushed, a flame in the grey
soft air:<br />We seemed to look on the hills of heaven;<br />You saw
within, but to me &rsquo;twas given<br />To see your face, as an angel&rsquo;s,
there.</p>
<p>Never again, ah surely never<br />Shall we wait and watch, where
of old we stood,<br />The low good-night of the hill and the river,<br />The
faint light fade, and the wan stars quiver,<br />Twain grown one in
the solitude.</p>

<h2>HESPEROTHEN.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>By the example of certain Grecian mariners, who, being safely returned
from the war about Troy, leave yet again their old lands and gods, seeking
they know not what, and choosing neither to abide in the fair Phaeacian
island, nor to dwell and die with the Sirens, at length end miserably
in a desert country by the sea, is set forth the <i>Vanity of Melancholy</i>.&nbsp;
And by the land of Phaeacia is to be understood the place of Art and
of fair Pleasures; and by Circe&rsquo;s Isle, the places of bodily delights,
whereof men, falling aweary, attain to Eld, and to the darkness of that
age.&nbsp; Which thing Master Fran&ccedil;oys Rabelais feigned, under
the similitude of the Isle of the Macraeones.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE SEEKERS FOR PHAEACIA.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There is a land in the remotest day,<br />Where the soft night is
born, and sunset dies;<br />The eastern shores see faint tides fade
away,<br />That wash the lands where laughter, tears, and sighs,<br />Make
life, - the lands beneath the blue of common skies.</p>
<p>But in the west is a mysterious sea,<br />(What sails have seen it,
or what shipmen known?)<br />With coasts enchanted where the Sirens
be,<br />With islands where a Goddess walks alone,<br />And in the cedar
trees the magic winds make moan</p>
<p>Eastward the human cares of house and home,<br />Cities, and ships,
and unknown Gods, and loves;<br />Westward, strange maidens fairer than
the foam,<br />And lawless lives of men, and haunted groves,<br />Wherein
a God may dwell, and where the Dryad roves.</p>
<p>The Gods are careless of the days and death<br />Of toilsome men,
beyond the western seas;<br />The Gods are heedless of their painful
breath,<br />And love them not, for they are not as these;<br />But
in the golden west they live and lie at ease.</p>
<p>Yet the Phaeacians well they love, who live<br />At the light&rsquo;s
limit, passing careless hours,<br />Most like the Gods; and they have
gifts to give,<br />Even wine, and fountains musical, and flowers,<br />And
song, and if they will, swift ships, and magic powers.</p>
<p>It is a quiet midland; in the cool<br />Of twilight comes the God,
though no man prayed,<br />To watch the maids and young men beautiful<br />Dance,
and they see him, and are not afraid,<br />For they are near of kin
to Gods, and undismayed.</p>
<p>Ah, would the bright red prows might bring us nigh<br />The dreamy
isles that the Immortals keep!<br />But with a mist they hide them wondrously,<br />And
far the path and dim to where they sleep, -<br />The loved, the shadowy
lands along the shadowy deep.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A SONG OF PHAEACIA.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The languid sunset, mother of roses,<br />Lingers, a light on the
magic seas,<br />The wide fire flames, as a flower uncloses,<br />Heavy
with odour, and loose to the breeze.</p>
<p>The red rose clouds, without law or leader,<br />Gather and float
in the airy plain;<br />The nightingale sings to the dewy cedar,<br />The
cedar scatters his scent to the main.</p>
<p>The strange flowers&rsquo; perfume turns to singing,<br />Heard afar
over moonlit seas;<br />The Siren&rsquo;s song, grown faint in winging,<br />Falls
in scent on the cedar trees.</p>
<p>As waifs blown out of the sunset, flying,<br />Purple, and rosy,
and grey, the birds<br />Brighten the air with their wings; their crying<br />Wakens
a moment the weary herds.</p>
<p>Butterflies flit from the fairy garden,<br />Living blossoms of flying
flowers;<br />Never the nights with winter harden,<br />Nor moons wax
keen in this land of ours.</p>
<p>Great fruits, fragrant, green and golden,<br />Gleam in the green,
and droop and fall;<br />Blossom, and bud, and flower unfolden,<br />Swing,
and cling to the garden wall.</p>
<p>Deep in the woods as twilight darkens,<br />Glades are red with the
scented fire;<br />Far in the dells the white maid hearkens,<br />Song
and sigh of the heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>Ah, and as moonlight fades in morning,<br />Maiden&rsquo;s song in
the matin grey,<br />Faints as the first bird&rsquo;s note, a warning,<br />Wakes
and wails to the new-born day.</p>
<p>The waking song and the dying measure<br />Meet, and the waxing and
waning light<br />Meet, and faint with the hours of pleasure,<br />The
rose of the sea and the sky is white.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE DEPARTURE FROM PHAEACIA.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>THE PHAEACIANS.</p>
<p>Why from the dreamy meadows,<br />More fair than any dream,<br />Why
will you seek the shadows<br />Beyond the ocean stream?</p>
<p>Through straits of storm and peril,<br />Through firths unsailed
before,<br />Why make you for the sterile,<br />The dark Kimmerian shore?</p>
<p>There no bright streams are flowing,<br />There day and night are
one,<br />No harvest time, no sowing,<br />No sight of any sun;</p>
<p>No sound of song or tabor,<br />No dance shall greet you there;<br />No
noise of mortal labour,<br />Breaks on the blind chill air.</p>
<p>Are ours not happy places,<br />Where Gods with mortals trod?<br />Saw
not our sires the faces<br />Of many a present God?</p>
<p>THE SEEKERS.</p>
<p>Nay, now no God comes hither,<br />In shape that men may see;<br />They
fare we know not whither,<br />We know not what they be.</p>
<p>Yea, though the sunset lingers<br />Far in your fairy glades,<br />Though
yours the sweetest singers,<br />Though yours the kindest maids,</p>
<p>Yet here be the true shadows,<br />Here in the doubtful light;<br />Amid
the dreamy meadows<br />No shadow haunts the night.</p>
<p>We seek a city splendid,<br />With light beyond the sun;<br />Or
lands where dreams are ended,<br />And works and days are done.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A BALLAD OF DEPARTURE. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a></h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fair white bird, what song art thou singing<br />In wintry weather
of lands o&rsquo;er sea?<br />Dear white bird, what way art thou winging,<br />Where
no grass grows, and no green tree?</p>
<p>I looked at the far off fields and grey,<br />There grew no tree
but the cypress tree,<br />That bears sad fruits with the flowers of
May,<br />And whoso looks on it, woe is he.</p>
<p>And whoso eats of the fruit thereof<br />Has no more sorrow, and
no more love;<br />And who sets the same in his garden stead,<br />In
a little space he is waste and dead.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THEY HEAR THE SIRENS FOR THE SECOND TIME.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The weary sails a moment slept,<br />The oars were silent for a space,<br />As
past Hesperian shores we swept,<br />That were as a remembered face<br />Seen
after lapse of hopeless years,<br />In Hades, when the shadows meet,<br />Dim
through the mist of many tears,<br />And strange, and though a shadow,
sweet.</p>
<p>So seemed the half-remembered shore,<br />That slumbered, mirrored
in the blue,<br />With havens where we touched of yore,<br />And ports
that over well we knew.<br />Then broke the calm before a breeze<br />That
sought the secret of the west;<br />And listless all we swept the seas<br />Towards
the Islands of the Blest.</p>
<p>Beside a golden sanded bay<br />We saw the Sirens, very fair<br />The
flowery hill whereon they lay,<br />The flowers set upon their hair.<br />Their
old sweet song came down the wind,<br />Remembered music waxing strong,<br />Ah
now no need of cords to bind,<br />No need had we of Orphic song.</p>
<p>It once had seemed a little thing,<br />To lay our lives down at
their feet,<br />That dying we might hear them sing,<br />And dying
see their faces sweet;<br />But now, we glanced, and passing by,<br />No
care had we to tarry long;<br />Faint hope, and rest, and memory<br />Were
more than any Siren&rsquo;s song.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CIRCE&rsquo;S ISLE REVISITED.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ah, Circe, Circe! in the wood we cried;<br />Ah, Circe, Circe! but
no voice replied;<br />No voice from bowers o&rsquo;ergrown and ruinous<br />As
fallen rocks upon the mountain side.</p>
<p>There was no sound of singing in the air;<br />Failed or fled the
maidens that were fair,<br />No more for sorrow or joy were seen of
us,<br />No light of laughing eyes, or floating hair.</p>
<p>The perfume, and the music, and the flame<br />Had passed away; the
memory of shame<br />Alone abode, and stings of faint desire,<br />And
pulses of vague quiet went and came.</p>
<p>Ah, Circe! in thy sad changed fairy place,<br />Our dead Youth came
and looked on us a space,<br />With drooping wings, and eyes of faded
fire,<br />And wasted hair about a weary face.</p>
<p>Why had we ever sought the magic isle<br />That seemed so happy in
the days erewhile?<br />Why did we ever leave it, where we met<br />A
world of happy wonders in one smile?</p>
<p>Back to the westward and the waning light<br />We turned, we fled;
the solitude of night<br />Was better than the infinite regret,<br />In
fallen places of our dead delight.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE LIMIT OF LANDS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Between the circling ocean sea<br />And the poplars of Persephone<br />There
lies a strip of barren sand,<br />Flecked with the sea&rsquo;s last
spray, and strown<br />With waste leaves of the poplars, blown<br />From
gardens of the shadow land.</p>
<p>With altars of old sacrifice<br />The shore is set, in mournful wise<br />The
mists upon the ocean brood;<br />Between the water and the air<br />The
clouds are born that float and fare<br />Between the water and the wood.</p>
<p>Upon the grey sea never sail<br />Of mortals passed within our hail,<br />Where
the last weak waves faint and flow;<br />We heard within the poplar
pale<br />The murmur of a doubtful wail<br />Of voices loved so long
ago.</p>
<p>We scarce had care to die or live,<br />We had no honey cake to give,<br />No
wine of sacrifice to shed;<br />There lies no new path over sea,<br />And
now we know how faint they be,<br />The feasts and voices of the Dead.</p>
<p>Ah, flowers and dance! ah, sun and snow!<br />Glad life, sad life
we did forego<br />To dream of quietness and rest;<br />Ah, would the
fleet sweet roses here<br />Poured light and perfume through the drear<br />Pale
year, and wan land of the west.</p>
<p>Sad youth, that let the spring go by<br />Because the spring is swift
to fly,<br />Sad youth, that feared to mourn or love,<br />Behold how
sadder far is this,<br />To know that rest is nowise bliss,<br />And
darkness is the end thereof.</p>

may remember girls with locks like thine;<br />May dream how, where
the waiting angels stand,<br />Some lost love&rsquo;s eyes are dim before
they shine<br />With welcome: - so past homes, or homes to be,<br />He
sees a moment, ere, a moment blind,<br />He crosses Death&rsquo;s inhospitable
sea,<br />And with brief passage of those barren lands<br />Comes to
the home that is not made with hands.</p>

<h3>SUMMER&rsquo;S ENDING.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The flags below the shadowy fern<br />Shine like spears between sun
and sea,<br />The tide and the summer begin to turn,<br />And ah, for
hearts, for hearts that yearn,<br />For fires of autumn that catch and
burn,<br />For love gone out between thee and me.</p>
<p>The wind is up, and the weather broken,<br />Blue seas, blue eyes,
are grieved and grey,<br />Listen, the word that the wind has spoken,<br />Listen,
the sound of the sea, - a token<br />That summer&rsquo;s over, and troths
are broken, -<br />That loves depart as the hours decay.</p>
<p>A love has passed to the loves passed over,<br />A month has fled
to the months gone by;<br />And none may follow, and none recover<br />July
and June, and never a lover<br />May stay the wings of the Loves that
hover,<br />As fleet as the light in a sunset sky.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>NIGHTINGALE WEATHER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[&lsquo;Serai-je nonnette, oui ou non?<br />Serai-je nonnette? je
crois que non.<br />Derri&egrave;re chez mon p&egrave;re<br />Il est
un bois taillis,<br />Le rossignol y chante<br />Et le jour et le nuit.<br />Il
chaste pour les filles<br />Qui n&rsquo;ont pas d&rsquo;ami;<br />Il
ne chante pas pour moi,<br />J&rsquo;en ai un, Dieu merci.&rsquo; -
OLD FRENCH.]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;LL never be a nun, I trow,<br />While apple bloom is white
as snow,<br />But far more fair to see;<br />I&rsquo;ll never wear nun&rsquo;s
black and white<br />While nightingales make sweet the night<br />Within
the apple tree.</p>
<p>Ah, listen! &rsquo;tis the nightingale,<br />And in the wood he makes
his wail,<br />Within the apple tree;<br />He singeth of the sore distress<br />Of
many ladies loverless;<br />Thank God, no song for me.</p>
<p>For when the broad May moon is low,<br />A gold fruit seen where
blossoms blow<br />In the boughs of the apple tree,<br />A step I know
is at the gate;<br />Ah love, but it is long to wait<br />Until night&rsquo;s
noon bring thee!</p>
<p>Between lark&rsquo;s song and nightingale&rsquo;s<br />A silent space,
while dawning pales,<br />The birds leave still and free<br />For words
and kisses musical,<br />For silence and for sighs that fall<br />In
the dawn, &lsquo;twixt him and me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LOVE AND WISDOM.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[&lsquo;When last we gathered roses in the garden<br />I found my
wits, but truly you lost yours.&rsquo;<br />THE BROKEN HEART.]</p>
<p>July, and June brought flowers and love<br />To you, but I would
none thereof,<br />Whose heart kept all through summer time<br />A flower
of frost and winter rime.<br />Yours was true wisdom - was it not? -<br />Even
love; but I had clean forgot,<br />Till seasons of the falling leaf,<br />All
loves, but one that turned to grief.<br />At length at touch of autumn
tide,<br />When roses fell, and summer died,<br />All in a dawning deep
with dew,<br />Love flew to me, love fled from you.</p>
<p>The roses drooped their weary heads,<br />I spoke among the garden
beds;<br />You would not hear, you could not know,<br />Summer and love
seemed long ago,<br />As far, as faint, as dim a dream,<br />As to the
dead this world may seem.<br />Ah sweet, in winter&rsquo;s miseries,<br />Perchance
you may remember this,<br />How wisdom was not justified<br />In summer
time or autumn-tide,<br />Though for this once below the sun,<br />Wisdom
and love were made at one;<br />But love was bitter-bought enough,<br />And
wisdom light of wing as love.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>GOOD-BYE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Kiss me, and say good-bye;<br />Good-bye, there is no word to say
but this,<br />Nor any lips left for my lips to kiss,<br />Nor any tears
to shed, when these tears dry;<br />Kiss me, and say, good-bye.</p>
<p>Farewell, be glad, forget;<br />There is no need to say &lsquo;forget,&rsquo;
I know,<br />For youth is youth, and time will have it so,<br />And
though your lips are pale, and your eyes wet,<br />Farewell, you must
forget.</p>
<p>You shall bring home your sheaves,<br />Many, and heavy, and with
blossoms twined<br />Of memories that go not out of mind;<br />Let this
one sheaf be twined with poppy leaves<br />When you bring home your
sheaves.</p>
<p>In garnered loves of thine,<br />The ripe good fruit of many hearts
and years,<br />Somewhere let this lie, grey and salt with tears;<br />It
grew too near the sea wind, and the brine<br />Of life, this love of
mine.</p>
<p>This sheaf was spoiled in spring,<br />And over-long was green, and
early sere,<br />And never gathered gold in the late year<br />From
autumn suns, and moons of harvesting,<br />But failed in frosts of spring.</p>
<p>Yet was it thine my sweet,<br />This love, though weak as young corn
wither&eacute;d,<br />Whereof no man may gather and make bread;<br />Thine,
though it never knew the summer heat;<br />Forget not quite, my sweet.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>AN OLD PRAYER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[Greek text which cannot be reproduced<br />ODYSSEY, xiii. 59.]</p>
<p>My prayer an old prayer borroweth,<br />Of ancient love and memory
-<br />&lsquo;Do thou farewell, till Eld and Death,<br />That come to
all men, come to thee.&rsquo;<br />Gently as winter&rsquo;s early breath,<br />Scarce
felt, what time the swallows flee,<br />To lands whereof <i>no man knoweth<br /></i>Of
summer, over land and sea;<br />So with thy soul may summer be,<br />Even
as the ancient singer saith,<br />&lsquo;Do thou farewell, till Eld
and Death,<br />That come to all men, come to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LOVE&rsquo;S MIRACLE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>With other helpless folk about the gate,<br />The gate called Beautiful,
with weary eyes<br />That take no pleasure in the summer skies,<br />Nor
all things that are fairest, does she wait;<br />So bleak a time, so
sad a changeless fate<br />Makes her with dull experience early wise,<br />And
in the dawning and the sunset, sighs<br />That all hath been, and shall
be, desolate.</p>
<p>Ah, if Love come not soon, and bid her live,<br />And know herself
the fairest of fair things,<br />Ah, if he have no healing gift to give,<br />Warm
from his breast, and holy from his wings,<br />Or if at least Love&rsquo;s
shadow in passing by<br />Touch not and heal her, surely she must die.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>DREAMS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>He spake not truth, however wise, who said<br />That happy, and that
hapless men in sleep<br />Have equal fortune, fallen from care as deep<br />As
countless, careless, races of the dead.<br />Not so, for alien paths
of dreams we tread,<br />And one beholds the faces that he sighs<br />In
vain to bring before his daylit eyes,<br />And waking, he remembers
on his bed;</p>
<p>And one with fainting heart and feeble hand<br />Fights a dim battle
in a doubtful land,<br />Where strength and courage were of no avail;<br />And
one is borne on fairy breezes far<br />To the bright harbours of a golden
star<br />Down fragrant fleeting waters rosy pale.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>FAIRY LAND.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In light of sunrise and sunsetting,<br />The long days lingered,
in forgetting<br />That ever passion, keen to hold<br />What may not
tarry, was of old,<br />In lands beyond the weary wold;<br />Beyond
the bitter stream whose flood<br />Runs red waist-high with slain men&rsquo;s
blood.<br />Was beauty once a thing that died?<br />Was pleasure never
satisfied?<br />Was rest still broken by the vain<br />Desire of action,
bringing pain,<br />To die in languid rest again?<br />All this was
quite forgotten there,<br />Where never winter chilled the year,<br />Nor
spring brought promise unfulfilled,<br />Nor, with the eager summer
killed,<br />The languid days drooped autumnwards.<br />So magical a
season guards<br />The constant prime of a cool June;<br />So slumbrous
is the river&rsquo;s tune,<br />That knows no thunder of heavy rains,<br />Nor
ever in the summer wanes,<br />Like waters of the summer time<br />In
lands far from the Fairy clime.</p>
<p>Yea, there the Fairy maids are kind,<br />With nothing of the changeful
mind<br />Of maidens in the days that were;<br />And if no laughter
fills the air<br />With sound of silver murmurings,<br />And if no prayer
of passion brings<br />A love nigh dead to life again,<br />Yet sighs
more subtly sweet remain,<br />And smiles that never satiate,<br />And
loves that fear scarce any fate.<br />Alas, no words can bring the bloom<br />Of
Fairy Land; the faint perfume,<br />The sweet low light, the magic air,<br />To
eyes of who has not been there:<br />Alas, no words, nor any spell<br />Can
lull the eyes that know too well,<br />The lost fair world of Fairy
Land.</p>
<p>Ah, would that I had never been<br />The lover of the Fairy Queen!<br />Or
would that through the sleepy town,<br />The grey old place of Ercildoune,<br />And
all along the little street,<br />The soft fall of the white deer&rsquo;s
feet<br />Came, with the mystical command<br />That I must back to Fairy
Land!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>TWO SONNETS OF THE SIRENS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[&lsquo;Les Sir&egrave;nes estoient tant intimes amies et fidelles
compagnes de Proserpine, qu&rsquo;elles estoient toujours ensemble.&nbsp;
Esmues du juste deuil de la perte de leur ch&egrave;re compagne, et
enuy&eacute;es jusques au desespoir, elles s&rsquo;arrest&egrave;rent
&agrave; la mer Sicilienne, o&ugrave; par leurs chants elles attiroient
les navigans, mais l&rsquo;unique fin de la volup&eacute; de leur musique
est la Mort.&rsquo; - PONTUS DE TYARD.&nbsp; 1570.]</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The Sirens once were maidens innocent<br />That through the water-meads
with Proserpine<br />Plucked no fire-hearted flowers, but were content<br />Cool
fritillaries and flag-flowers to twine,<br />With lilies woven and with
wet woodbine;<br />Till once they sought the bright AEtnaean flowers,<br />And
their bright mistress fled from summer hours<br />With Hades, down the
irremeable decline.<br />And they have sought her all the wide world
through<br />Till many years, and wisdom, and much wrong<br />Have filled
and changed their song, and o&rsquo;er the blue<br />Rings deadly sweet
the magic of the song,<br />And whoso hears must listen till he die<br />Far
on the flowery shores of Sicily.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>So is it with this singing art of ours,<br />That once with maids
went maidenlike, and played<br />With woven dances in the poplar-shade,<br />And
all her song was but of lady&rsquo;s bowers<br />And the returning swallows,
and spring-flowers,<br />Till forth to seek a shadow-queen she strayed,<br />A
shadowy land; and now hath overweighed<br />Her singing chaplet with
the snow and showers.<br />Yea, fair well-water for the bitter brine<br />She
left, and by the margin of life&rsquo;s sea<br />Sings, and her song
is full of the sea&rsquo;s moan,<br />And wild with dread, and love
of Proserpine;<br />And whoso once has listened to her, he<br />His
whole life long is slave to her alone.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A LA BELLE H&Eacute;L&Egrave;NE.<br />AFTER RONSARD.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>More closely than the clinging vine<br />About the wedded tree,<br />Clasp
thou thine arms, ah, mistress mine!<br />About the heart of me.<br />Or
seem to sleep, and stoop your face<br />Soft on my sleeping eyes,<br />Breathe
in your life, your heart, your grace,<br />Through me, in kissing wise.<br />Bow
down, bow down your face, I pray,<br />To me, that swoon to death,<br />Breathe
back the life you kissed away,<br />Breathe back your kissing breath.<br />So
by your eyes I swear and say,<br />My mighty oath and sure,<br />From
your kind arms no maiden may<br />My loving heart allure.<br />I&rsquo;ll
bear your yoke, that&rsquo;s light enough,<br />And to the Elysian plain,<br />When
we are dead of love, my love,<br />One boat shall bear us twain.<br />They&rsquo;ll
flock around you, fleet and fair,<br />All true loves that have been,<br />And
you of all the shadows there,<br />Shall be the shadow queen.<br /><i>Ah
shadow-loves, and shadow-lips</i>!<br /><i>Ah, while &rsquo;tis called
to-day</i>,<br /><i>Love me, my love, for summer slips</i>,<br /><i>And
August ebbs away.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SYLVIE ET AUR&Eacute;LIE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[IN MEMORY OF G&Eacute;RARD DE NERVAL.]</p>
<p>Two loves there were, and one was born<br />Between the sunset and
the rain;<br />Her singing voice went through the corn,<br />Her dance
was woven &lsquo;neath the thorn,<br />On grass the fallen blossoms
stain;<br />And suns may set, and moons may wane,<br />But this love
comes no more again.</p>
<p>There were two loves and one made white<br />Thy singing lips, and
golden hair;<br />Born of the city&rsquo;s mire and light,<br />The
shame and splendour of the night,<br />She trapped and fled thee unaware;<br />Not
through the lamplight and the rain<br />Shalt thou behold this love
again.</p>
<p>Go forth and seek, by wood and hill,<br />Thine ancient love of dawn
and dew;<br />There comes no voice from mere or rill,<br />Her dance
is over, fallen still<br />The ballad burdens that she knew;<br />And
thou must wait for her in vain,<br />Till years bring back thy youth
again.</p>
<p>That other love, afield, afar<br />Fled the light love, with lighter
feet.<br />Nay, though thou seek where gravesteads are,<br />And flit
in dreams from star to star,<br />That dead love shalt thou never meet,<br />Till
through bleak dawn and blowing rain<br />Thy fled soul find her soul
again.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A LOST PATH.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[Plotinus, the Greek philosopher, had a certain proper mode of ecstasy,
whereby, as Porphyry saith, his soul, becoming free from his deathly
flesh, was made one with the Spirit that is in the World.]</p>
<p>Alas, the path is lost, we cannot leave<br />Our bright, our clouded
life, and pass away<br />As through strewn clouds, that stain the quiet
eve,<br />To heights remoter of the purer day.<br />The soul may not,
returning whence she came,<br />Bathe herself deep in Being, and forget<br />The
joys that fever, and the cares that fret,<br />Made once more one with
the eternal flame<br />That breathes in all things ever more the same.<br />She
would be young again, thus drinking deep<br />Of her old life; and this
has been, men say,<br />But this we know not, who have only sleep<br />To
soothe us, sleep more terrible than day,<br />Where dead delights, and
fair lost faces stray,<br />To make us weary at our wakening;<br />And
of that long-lost path to the Divine<br />We dream, as some Greek shepherd
erst might sing,<br />Half credulous, of easy Proserpine<br />And of
the lands that lie &lsquo;beneath the day&rsquo;s decline.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE SHADE OF HELEN.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[Some say that Helen went never to Troy, but abode in Egypt; for
the Gods, having made in her semblance a woman out of clouds and shadows,
sent the same to be wife to Paris.&nbsp; For this shadow then the Greeks
and Trojans slew each other.]</p>
<p>Why from the quiet hollows of the hills,<br />And extreme meeting
place of light and shade,<br />Wherein soft rains fell slowly, and became<br />Clouds
among sister clouds, where fair spent beams<br />And dying glories of
the sun would dwell,<br />Why have they whom I know not, nor may know,<br />Strange
hands, unseen and ruthless, fashioned me,<br />And borne me from the
silent shadowy hills,<br />Hither, to noise and glow of alien life,<br />To
harsh and clamorous swords, and sound of war?</p>
<p>One speaks unto me words that would be sweet,<br />Made harsh, made
keen with love that knows me not,<br />And some strange force, within
me or around,<br />Makes answer, kiss for kiss, and sigh for sigh,<br />And
somewhere there is fever in the halls,<br />That troubles me, for no
such trouble came<br />To vex the cool far hollows of the hills.</p>
<p>The foolish folk crowd round me, and they cry,<br />That house, and
wife, and lands, and all Troy town,<br />Are little to lose, if they
may keep me here,<br />And see me flit, a pale and silent shade,<br />Among
the streets bereft, and helpless shrines.</p>
<p>At other hours another life seems mine,<br />Where one great river
runs unswollen of rain,<br />By pyramids of unremembered kings,<br />And
homes of men obedient to the Dead.<br />There dark and quiet faces come
and go<br />Around me, then again the shriek of arms,<br />And all the
turmoil of the Ilian men.<br />What are they?&nbsp; Even shadows such
as I.<br />What make they?&nbsp; Even this - the sport of Gods -<br />The
sport of Gods, however free they seem.<br />Ah would the game were ended,
and the light,<br />The blinding light, and all too mighty suns,<br />Withdrawn,
and I once more with sister shades,<br />Unloved, forgotten, mingled
with the mist,<br />Dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills.<br />Ah,
would &lsquo;t were the cloud&rsquo;s playtime, when the sun<br />Clothes
us in raiment of a rosy flame,<br />And through the sky we flit, and
gather grey,<br />Like men that leave their golden youth behind,<br />And
through their wind-driven ways they gather grey,<br />And we like them
grow wan, and the chill East<br />Receives us, as the Earth accepts
all men, -<br />But <i>we</i> await the dawn of a new day.</p>

<h2>SONNETS TO POETS.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h3>JACQUES TAHUREAU.&nbsp; 1530.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ah thou! that, undeceived and unregretting,<br />Saw&rsquo;st Death
so near thee on the flowery way,<br />And with no sigh that life was
near the setting,<br />Took&rsquo;st the delight and dalliance of the
day,<br />Happy thou wert, to live and pass away<br />Ere life or love
had done thee any wrong;<br />Ere thy wreath faded, or thy locks grew
grey,<br />Or summer came to lull thine April song,<br />Sweet as all
shapes of sweet things unfulfilled,<br />Buds bloomless, and the broken
violet,<br />The first spring days, the sounds and scents thereof;<br />So
clear thy fire of song, so early chilled,<br />So brief, so bright thy
life that gaily met<br />Death, for thy Death came hand in hand with
Love.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>FRAN&Ccedil;OIS VILLON.&nbsp; 1450.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>List, all that love light mirth, light tears, and all<br />That know
the heart of shameful loves, or pure;<br />That know delights depart,
desires endure,<br />A fevered tribe of ghosts funereal,<br />Widowed
of dead delights gone out of call;<br />List, all that deem the glory
of the rose<br />Is brief as last year&rsquo;s suns, or last year&rsquo;s
snows<br />The new suns melt from off the sundial.</p>
<p>All this your master Villon knew and sung;<br />Despised delights,
and faint foredone desire;<br />And shame, a deathless worm, a quenchless
fire;<br />And laughter from the heart&rsquo;s last sorrow wrung,<br />When
half-repentance but makes evil whole,<br />And prayer that cannot help
wears out the soul.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>PIERRE RONSARD.&nbsp; 1560.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Master, I see thee with the locks of grey,<br />Crowned by the Muses
with the laurel-wreath;<br />I see the roses hiding underneath,<br />Cassandra&rsquo;s
gift; she was less dear than they.<br />Thou, Master, first hast roused
the lyric lay,<br />The sleeping song that the dead years bequeath,<br />Hast
sung sweet answer to the songs that breathe<br />Through ages, and through
ages far away.</p>
<p>Yea, and in thee the pulse of ancient passion<br />Leaped, and the
nymphs amid the spring-water<br />Made bare their lovely limbs in the
old fashion,<br />And birds&rsquo; song in the branches was astir.<br />Ah,
but thy songs are sad, thy roses wan,<br />Thy bees have fed on yews
Sardinian.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>G&Eacute;RARD DE NERVAL.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all that were thy prisons - ah, untamed,<br />Ah, light and sacred
soul! - none holds thee now;<br />No wall, no bar, no body of flesh,
but thou<br />Art free and happy in the lands unnamed,<br />About whose
gates, with weary wings and maimed,<br />Thou most wert wont to linger,
entering there<br />A moment, and returning rapt, with fair<br />Tidings
that men or heeded not or blamed;<br />And they would smile and wonder,
seeing where<br />Thou stood&rsquo;st, to watch light leaves, or clouds,
or wind,<br />Dreamily murmuring a ballad air,<br />Caught from the
Valois peasants; dost thou find<br />Old prophecies fulfilled now, old
tales true<br />In the new world, where all things are made new?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE DEATH OF MIRANDOLA.&nbsp; 1494.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>[&lsquo;The Queen of Heaven appeared, comforting him and promising
that he should not utterly die.&rsquo; - THOMAS MORE, <i>Life of Piens,
Earl of Mirandola</i>.]</p>
<p>Strange lilies came with autumn; new and old<br />Were mingling,
and the old world passed away,<br />And the night gathered, and the
shadows grey<br />Dimmed the kind eyes and dimmed the locks of gold,<br />And
face beloved of Mirandola.<br />The Virgin then, to comfort him and
stay,<br />Kissed the thin cheek, and kissed the lips acold,<br />The
lips unkissed of women many a day.<br />Nor she alone, for queens of
the old creed,<br />Like rival queens that tended Arthur, there<br />Were
gathered, Venus in her mourning weed,<br />Pallas and Dian; wise, and
pure, and fair<br />Was he they mourned, who living did not wrong<br />One
altar of its dues of wine and song.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
