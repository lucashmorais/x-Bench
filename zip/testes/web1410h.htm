<h1>
The Second Book of Chronicles
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Solomon the son of David
was strengthened in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and
magnified him exceedingly.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Solomon spoke to all Israel, to
the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I>.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> So Solomon, and all the assembly
with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the
Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the
wilderness.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> But David had
brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had
prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Moreover the bronze altar, that
Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the
tent of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Solomon went up there to
the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and
offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> In that night God appeared to
Solomon, and said to him, &quot;Ask what I shall give you.&quot;  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Solomon said to God, You have
shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in
his place.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Now, Yahweh
God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made
me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Give me now wisdom and knowledge,
that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this
your people, that is so great?  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> God said to Solomon, Because this
was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor
the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have
asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people,
over whom I have made you king:  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> wisdom and knowledge is granted
to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of
the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after
you have the like.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> So
Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent
of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Solomon gathered chariots and
horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve
thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king
at Jerusalem.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> The king
made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to
be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> The horses which Solomon had were
brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king's merchants purchased them
from Kue.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> They brought up
and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a
horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and
the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now Solomon purposed to
build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Solomon counted out seventy
thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone
cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee
them.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Solomon sent to
Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with David my father, and
sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, <I>even so deal
with me</I>.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Behold, I am
about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to
him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual
show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the
Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God.
This is <I>an ordinance</I> forever to Israel.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> The house which I build is great;
for great is our God above all gods.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But who is able to build him a
house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain him? who am I
then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before
him?  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Now therefore send me
a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron,
and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave <I>all
manner of</I> engravings, <I>to be</I> with the skillful men who are with
me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Send me also cedar trees, fir
trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know
how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall be with your
servants,  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> even to prepare
me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be
great and wonderful.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Behold, I will give to your
servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten
wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths
of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Then Huram the king of Tyre
answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, &quot;Because Yahweh loves
his people, he has made you king over them.&quot;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Huram continued, &quot;Blessed be
Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to
David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, that
should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Now I have sent a skillful man,
endowed with understanding, of Huram my father's,  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> the son of a woman of the
daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in
gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in
purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any
manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place
appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my
lord David your father.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Now therefore the wheat and the
barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to
his servants:  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> and we will
cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it
to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to
Jerusalem.&quot;  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Solomon
numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the
numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were
found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> He set seventy thousand of them
to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the
mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at
work.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Then Solomon began to
build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where
<I>Yahweh</I> appeared to David his father, which he made ready in the
place that David had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the
Jebusite.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> He began to
build in the second <I>day</I> of the second month, in the fourth year of
his reign.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Now these are
the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God.
The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the
breadth twenty cubits.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> The
porch that was before <I>the house</I>, its length, according to the
breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred
twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> The greater house he made a
ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it
with palm trees and chains.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> He garnished the house with
precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> He overlaid also the house, the
beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and
engraved cherubim on the walls.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> He made the most holy house: its
length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its
breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six
hundred talents.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> The
weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper
chambers with gold.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> In
the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid
them with gold.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> The wings
of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one <I>cherub</I>
was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was
<I>likewise</I> five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
 <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> The wing of the other
cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other
wing was five cubits <I>also</I>, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
 <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> The wings of these
cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their
feet, and their faces were toward the house.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> He made the veil of blue, and
purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.
 <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Also he made before the
house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on
the top of each of them was five cubits.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> He made chains in the oracle, and
put <I>them</I> on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred
pomegranates, and put them on the chains.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> He set up the pillars before the
temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the
name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left
Boaz.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Then he made an altar
of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten
cubits its height.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Also he
made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and
its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.
 <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Under it was the likeness
of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen
were in two rows, cast when it was cast.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> It stood on twelve oxen, three
looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three
looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea
was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> It was a handbreadth thick; and
its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it
received and held three thousand baths.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> He made also ten basins, and put
five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things
as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for
the priests to wash in.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> He
made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning
them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on
the left.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> He made also ten
tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on
the left. He made one hundred basins of gold.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Furthermore he made the court of
the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid
the doors of them with brass.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> He set the sea on the right side
<I>of the house</I> eastward, toward the south.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Huram made the pots, and the
shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he
did for king Solomon in the house of God:  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> the two pillars, and the bowls,
and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of
the pillars,  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> and the four
hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for
each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
pillars.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> He made also the
bases, and the basins made he on the bases;  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> one sea, and the twelve oxen
under it.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> The pots also,
and the shovels, and the forks, and all its vessels, did Huram his father
make for king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> In the plain of the Jordan did
the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
 <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Thus Solomon made all
these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be
found out.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Solomon made
all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and
the tables with the show bread on them;  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> and the lampstands with their
lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
 <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> and the flowers, and the
lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> and the snuffers, and the basins,
and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of
the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of
the main hall of the temple were of gold.
<p>  <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Thus all the work that
Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the
things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold,
and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
 <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Then Solomon assembled the
elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring
up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is
Zion.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> And all the men of
Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was <I>in</I>
the seventh month.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> All the
elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> and they brought up the ark, and
the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these
did the priests the Levites bring up.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> King Solomon and all the
congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark,
sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for
multitude.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> The priests
brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle
of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the
cherubim.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> For the cherubim
spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim
covered the ark and its poles above.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> The poles were so long that the
ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
not seen outside: and there it is to this day.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> There was nothing in the ark save
the two tables which Moses put <I>there</I> at Horeb, when Yahweh made a
covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> It happened, when the priests
were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had
sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions;  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> also the Levites who were the
singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and
their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed
instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> it happened, when the trumpeters
and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and
thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and
cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, <I>saying</I>, For
he is good; for his loving kindness endures forever; that then the house
was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> so that the priests could not
stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled
the house of God.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Then spoke Solomon,
Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> But I have built you a house of
habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> The king turned his face, and
blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> He said, Blessed be
Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father,
and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Since the day that I brought forth
my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes
of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
I any man to be prince over my people Israel:  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> but I have chosen Jerusalem, that
my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
 <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Now it was in the heart of
David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of
Israel.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> But Yahweh said to
David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my
name, you did well that it was in your heart:  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> nevertheless you shall not build
the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall
build the house for my name.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Yahweh has performed his word
that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit
on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for
the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> There have I set the ark, in
which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of
Israel.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> He stood before
the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and
spread forth his hands  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> (for Solomon had made a bronze
scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high,
and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled
down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his
hands toward heaven;)  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> and
he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven,
or on earth; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who
walk before you with all their heart;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> who have kept with your servant
David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your
mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of
Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have
promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on
the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to
walk in my law as you have walked before me.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of
Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David.
 <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> But will God indeed dwell
with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't
contain you; how much less this house which I have built!  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Yet have you respect to the
prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen
to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> that your eyes may be open toward
this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that
you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
pray toward this place.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Listen to the petitions of your
servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this
place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you
hear, forgive.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> If a man
sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to
swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house;  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> then hear from heaven, and do,
and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his
way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according
to his righteousness.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> If
your people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have
sinned against you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray
and make supplication before you in this house;  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> then hear from heaven, and
forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land
which you gave to them and to their fathers.  <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> When the sky is shut up, and
there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray
toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when
you do afflict them:  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> then
hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people
Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and
send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an
inheritance.  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> If there be
in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight or mildew,
locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their
cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there be;  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> whatever prayer and supplication
be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man
his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward
this house:  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> then hear
from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man
according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only,
know the hearts of the children of men;)  <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> that they may fear you, to walk
in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our
fathers.  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> Moreover
concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall
come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand,
and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this
house:  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> then hear from
heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the
foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know
your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may
know that this house which I have built is called by your name.  <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> If your people go out to battle
against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray
to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have
built for your name;  <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> then
hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their
cause.  <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> If they sin
against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin), and you are angry with
them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive
to a land far off or near;  <a name="C6V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:37</font></a> yet if they shall repent
themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and
make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have
sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;  <a name="C6V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:38</font></a> if they return to you with all
their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where
they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave
to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house
which I have built for your name:  <a name="C6V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:39</font></a> then hear from heaven, even from
your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their
cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.  <a name="C6V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:40</font></a> Now, my God, let, I beg you, your
eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made
in this place.  <a name="C6V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:41</font></a> Now
therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of
your strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation,
and let your saints rejoice in goodness.  <a name="C6V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:42</font></a> Yahweh God, don't turn away the
face of your anointed: remember <I>your</I> loving kindnesses to David
your servant.
<p>  <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Now when Solomon had
made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the
burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Yahweh filled the
house.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> The priests could
not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled
Yahweh's house.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> All the
children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of
Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the
ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh,
<I>saying</I>, For he is good; for his loving kindness endures for ever.
 <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Then the king and all the
people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> King Solomon offered a sacrifice
of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand
sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> The priests stood, according to
their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which
David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, (for his loving kindness
endures for ever), when David praised by their ministry: and the priests
sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Moreover Solomon made the middle
of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he
offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because
the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt
offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> So Solomon held the feast at that
time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the
entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> On the eighth day they held a
solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and
the feast seven days.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> On
the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away
to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had
shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Thus Solomon finished the house
of Yahweh, and the king's house: and he successfully completed all that
came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own
house.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Yahweh appeared to
Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have
chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> If I shut up the sky so that
there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I
send pestilence among my people;  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> if my people, who are called by
my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn
from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
their sin, and will heal their land.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> Now my eyes shall be open, and my
ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> For now have I chosen and made
this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my
heart shall be there perpetually.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> As for you, if you will walk
before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have
commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> then I will establish the throne
of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying,
There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> But if you turn away, and forsake
my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go
and serve other gods, and worship them;  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> then will I pluck them up by the
roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have
made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a
proverb and a byword among all peoples.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> This house, which is so high,
everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has
Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> They shall answer, Because they
abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and
served them: therefore has he brought all this evil on them.
<p>  <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> It happened at the end
of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his
own house,  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> that the cities
which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the
children of Israel to dwell there.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and
prevailed against it.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> He
built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built
in Hamath.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Also he built
Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with
walls, gates, and bars;  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> and Baalath, and all the storage
cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the
cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his
pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his
dominion.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> As for all the
people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;
 <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> of their children who were
left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn't consume,
of them did Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> But of the children of Israel did
Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief
of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> These were the chief officers of
king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> Solomon brought up the daughter
of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for
her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
Israel, because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come are holy.
 <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Then Solomon offered
burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built
before the porch,  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> even as
the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of
Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three
times in the year, <I>even</I> in the feast of unleavened bread, and in
the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> He appointed, according to the
ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their
service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister
before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers
also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God
commanded.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> They didn't
depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites
concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> Now all the work of Solomon was
prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it
was finished. <I>So</I> the house of Yahweh was completed.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber,
and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Huram sent him ships and servants
who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came
with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred
fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
<p>  <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> When the queen of
Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard
questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore
spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come
to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> Solomon told her all her
questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he didn't
tell her.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> When the queen
of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
 <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> and the food of his table,
and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and
their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent
by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in
her.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> She said to the king,
It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your
wisdom.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> However I didn't
believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold,
the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the
fame that I heard.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Happy
are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually
before you, and hear your wisdom.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Blessed be Yahweh your God, who
delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your
God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore
made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> She gave the king one hundred and
twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious
stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> The
servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from
Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> The king made of the algum trees
terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the king's house, and harps and
stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these seen
before in the land of Judah.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> King Solomon gave to the queen of
Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had
brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her
servants.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> Now the weight
of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six
talents of gold,  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> besides
that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia
and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> King Solomon made two
hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred <I>shekels</I> of beaten gold
went to one buckler.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> <I>he made</I> three hundred
shields of beaten gold; three hundred <I>shekels</I> of gold went to one
shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
 <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Moreover the king made a
great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> And there were six steps to the
throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and
stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing
beside the stays.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> Twelve
lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there
was nothing like it made in any kingdom.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> All king Solomon's drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of
Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of
Solomon.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> For the king had
ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three
years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and
apes, and peacocks.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> So
king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
 <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> All the kings of the
earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had
put in his heart.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> They
brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
 <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Solomon had four thousand
stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he
stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> He ruled over all the kings from
the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
 <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> The king made silver to
be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees
that are in the lowland, for abundance.  <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> They brought horses for Solomon
out of Egypt, and out of all lands.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, first and last, aren't they written in the history of Nathan the
prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions
of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over
all Israel forty years.  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> Solomon slept with his fathers,
and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his place.
<p>  <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Rehoboam went to
Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> It happened, when Jeroboam the
son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the
presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> They sent and called him; and
Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Your father made our yoke
grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and
his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> He said to them, Come again to me
after three days. The people departed.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> King Rehoboam took counsel with
the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived,
saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> They spoke to him, saying, If you
are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them,
then they will be your servants forever.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> But he forsook the counsel of the
old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who
had grown up with him, who stood before him.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> He said to them, What counsel
give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me,
saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> The young men who had grown up
with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to
you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to
us; thus you shall say to them, My little finger is thicker than my
father's waist.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Now
whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke:
my father chastised you with whips, but I <I>will chastise you</I> with
scorpions.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> So Jeroboam
and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade,
saying, Come to me again the third day.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> The king answered them roughly;
and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> and spoke to them after the
counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I
will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I <I>will
chastise you</I> with scorpions.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> So the king didn't listen to the
people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his
word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
 <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> When all Israel saw that
the king didn't listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What
portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
every man to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all
Israel departed to their tents.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> But as for the children of
Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
 <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Then king Rehoboam sent
Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of
Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get
him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> So Israel rebelled against the
house of David to this day.
<p>
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> When Rehoboam was come
to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred
eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to
bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> But the word of Yahweh came to
Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> Speak to Rehoboam the son of
Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
 <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Thus says Yahweh, You
shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers: return every man to his
house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the words of Yahweh,
and returned from going against Jeroboam.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and
built cities for defense in Judah.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and
Tekoa,  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Beth Zur, and
Soco, and Adullam,  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> and
Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and
Azekah,  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> and Zorah, and
Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
 <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> He fortified the
strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and
wine.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> In every city
<I>he put</I> shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. Judah
and Benjamin belonged to him.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> The priests and the Levites who
were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> For the Levites left their
suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for
Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the
priest's office to Yahweh;  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> and he appointed him priests for
the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had
made.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> After them, out of
all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God
of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their
fathers.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> So they
strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon
strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and
Solomon.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Rehoboam took
him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, <I>and
of</I> Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> and she bore him sons: Jeush,
and Shemariah, and Zaham.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> After her he took Maacah the
daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and
Shelomith.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Rehoboam
loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his
concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became
the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Rehoboam appointed Abijah the
son of Maacah to be chief, <I>even</I> the prince among his brothers; for
<I>he was minded</I> to make him king.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> He dealt wisely, and dispersed
of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every
fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought <I>for
them</I> many wives.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> It happened, when the
kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook
the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> It happened in the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
because they had trespassed against Yahweh,  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> with twelve hundred chariots, and
sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him
out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> He took the fortified cities
which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Now Shemaiah the prophet came to
Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to
Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have
forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
 <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Then the princes of
Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Yahweh is
righteous.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> When Yahweh
saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah,
saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will
grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on
Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> Nevertheless they shall be his
servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms
of the countries.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> So
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the
treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house:
he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had
made.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> King Rehoboam made
in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the
captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> It was so, that as often as the
king entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and
brought them back into the guard chamber.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> When he humbled himself, the
wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and
moreover in Judah there were good things <I>found</I>.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> So king Rehoboam strengthened
himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the
city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his
name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> He did that which was evil,
because he didn't set his heart to seek Yahweh.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first
and last, aren't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and
of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? There were wars between
Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his
place.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> In the eighteenth year
of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Three years reigned he in
Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of
Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> Abijah joined battle with an army
of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam
set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen
men, who were mighty men of valor.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Abijah stood up on Mount
Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me,
Jeroboam and all Israel:  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Ought you not to know that
Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever,
even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his
lord.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> There were gathered
to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against
Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted,
and could not withstand them.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Now you think to withstand the
kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great
multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made
you for gods.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Haven't you
driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and
made you priests after the manner of the peoples of <I>other</I> lands? so
that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams,
the same may be a priest of <I>those who are</I> no gods.  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> But as for us, Yahweh is our
God, and we have not forsaken him; and <I>we have</I> priests ministering
to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> and they burn to Yahweh every
morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the show
bread also <I>set they</I> in order on the pure table; and the lampstand
of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the instruction
of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Behold, God is with us at our
head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against
you. Children of Israel, don't you fight against Yahweh, the God of your
fathers; for you shall not prosper.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> But Jeroboam caused an ambush to
come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was
behind them.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> When Judah
looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried
to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Then the men of Judah gave a
shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck
Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> The children of Israel fled
before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Abijah and his people killed
them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five
hundred thousand chosen men.  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Thus the children of Israel were
brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because
they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> Abijah pursued after Jeroboam,
and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its
towns, and Ephron with its towns.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Neither did Jeroboam recover
strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck him, and he died.
 <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> But Abijah grew mighty,
and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two
sons, and sixteen daughters.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> The rest of the acts of Abijah,
and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the
prophet Iddo.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> So Abijah slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son
reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> Asa did that which was good and
right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> for he took away the foreign
altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the
Asherim,  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> and commanded
Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the
commandment.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Also he took
away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images:
and the kingdom was quiet before him.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> He built fortified cities in
Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because
Yahweh had given him rest.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> For he said to Judah, Let us
build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and
bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we
have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and
prospered.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> Asa had an
army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand;
and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty
thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> There came out against them Zerah
the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred
chariots; and he came to Mareshah.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Then Asa went out to meet him,
and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
 <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> Asa cried to Yahweh his
God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the
mighty and him who has no strength: help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely
on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you
are our God; don't let man prevail against you.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians
before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Asa and the people who were with
him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that
they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh,
and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> They struck all the cities
around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they despoiled all
the cities; for there was much spoil in them.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> They struck also the tents of
livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned
to Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> The Spirit of God came
on Azariah the son of Oded:  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> and he went out to meet Asa, and
said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Yahweh is with
you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you;
but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Now for a long season Israel was
without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:
 <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> But when in their
distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was
found of them.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> In those
times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but
great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> They were broken in pieces,
nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with
all adversity.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> But be you
strong, and don't let your hands be slack; for your work shall be
rewarded.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> When Asa heard
these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and
put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and
out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and
he renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> He gathered all Judah and
Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh,
and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when
they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> So they gathered themselves
together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Asa.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> They
sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought,
seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> They entered into the covenant
to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with
all their soul;  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> and that
whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death,
whether small or great, whether man or woman.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> They swore to Yahweh with a loud
voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> All Judah rejoiced at the oath;
for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole
desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest all around.
 <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> Also Maacah, the mother
of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an
abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust
of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> But the high places were not
taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all
his days.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> He brought
into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that
he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> There was no more war to the
five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> In the six and
thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against
Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come
in to Asa king of Judah.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> Then Asa brought out silver and
gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king's house,
and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,
 <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> <I>There is</I> a league
between me and you, as <I>there was</I> between my father and your father:
behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha
king of Israel, that he may depart from me.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> Ben Hadad listened to king Asa,
and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they
struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of
Naphtali.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> It happened,
when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work
cease.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Then Asa the king
took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber,
with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
 <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> At that time Hanani the
seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied
on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is
the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Weren't the Ethiopians and the
Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because
you did rely on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> For the eyes of Yahweh run back
and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf
of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly;
for from henceforth you shall have wars.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> Then Asa was angry with the
seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of
this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Behold, the acts of Asa, first
and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> In the
thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease
was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn't seek Yahweh, but to the
physicians.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> Asa slept
with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
 <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> They buried him in his
own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid
him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds <I>of
spices</I> prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great
burning for him.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> Jehoshaphat his son
reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> He placed forces in all the
fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat,
because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn't seek
the Baals,  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> but sought to
the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the
doings of Israel.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Therefore Yahweh established the
kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he
had riches and honor in abundance.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> His heart was lifted up in the
ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the
Asherim out of Judah.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Also in the third year of his
reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and
Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> and with them the Levites, even
Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and
with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> They taught in Judah, having the
book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all
the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> The fear of Yahweh fell on all
the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war
against Jehoshaphat.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> Some of the Philistines brought
Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought
him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and
seven hundred male goats.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> Jehoshaphat grew great
exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> He had many works in the cities
of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> This was the numbering of them
according to their fathers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands:
Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred
thousand;  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> and next to
him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;
 <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> and next to him Amasiah
the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh; and with him
two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man
of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
 <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> and next to him
Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.
 <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> These were those who
waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified
cities throughout all Judah.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> Now Jehoshaphat had
riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.  <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> After certain years he went down
to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and
for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up <I>with him</I>
to Ramoth Gilead.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> Ahab
king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to
Ramoth Gilead? He answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your
people; and <I>we will be</I> with you in the war.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> Jehoshaphat said to the king of
Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> Then the king of Israel gathered
the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to
Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for God
will deliver it into the hand of the king.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there
here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh: but I
hate him; for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil: the
same is Micaiah the son of Imla. Jehoshaphat said, Don't let the king say
so.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> Then the king of
Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
 <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> Now the king of Israel
and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their
robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate
of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah
made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these you shall
push the Syrians, until they be consumed.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> All the prophets prophesied so,
saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it
into the hand of the king.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> The messenger who went to call
Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets
<I>declare</I> good to the king with one mouth: let your word therefore,
Please be like one of theirs, and speak you good.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives,
what my God says, that will I speak.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> When he was come to the king,
the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or
shall I forbear? He said, Go up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered
into your hand.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> The king
said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me
nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> He said, I saw all Israel
scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh
said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in
peace.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> The king of
Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that he would not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil?  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> <I>Micaiah</I> said,
&quot;Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his
throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his
left.  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Yahweh said, 'Who
shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth
Gilead?' One spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that
manner.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> There came forth
a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.' Yahweh
said to him, 'How?'  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> He
said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets.' He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go
forth, and do so.'  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Now
therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these
your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.&quot;  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Then Zedekiah the son of
Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way
went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> Micaiah said, Behold, you shall
see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
 <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> The king of Israel said,
Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to
Joash the king's son;  <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> and say, Thus says the king, Put
this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with
water of affliction, until I return in peace.  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> Micaiah said, If you return at
all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. He said, Hear, you peoples, all
of you.  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> So the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.  <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you
on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into
the battle.  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> Now the king
of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither
with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> It happened, when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried
out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them <I>to depart</I> from him.
 <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> It happened, when the
captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they
turned back from pursuing him.  <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> A certain man drew his bow at a
venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor.
Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand, and carry
me out of the army; for I am sore wounded.  <a name="C18V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:34</font></a> The battle increased that day:
however the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the
Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he
died.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> Jehoshaphat the king
of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> Jehu the son of Hanani the seer
went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the
wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? for this thing wrath is on you
from before Yahweh.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> Nevertheless there are good
things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the
land, and have set your heart to seek God.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem:
and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country
of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
 <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> He set judges in the land
throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> and said to the judges, Consider
what you do: for you don't judge for man, but for Yahweh; and <I>he is</I>
with you in the judgment.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Now therefore let the fear of
Yahweh be on you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with
Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> Moreover in Jerusalem did
Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for
controversies. They returned to Jerusalem.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> He commanded them, saying, Thus
you shall do in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
 <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> Whenever any controversy
shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between
blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you
shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Yahweh, and so wrath come
on you and on your brothers: this do, and you shall not be guilty.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> Behold, Amariah the chief priest
is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters: also the Levites
shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Yahweh be with the
good.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> It happened after
this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them
some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> Then there came some who told
Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against you from beyond
the sea from Syria; and behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar (the same is En
Gedi).  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> Jehoshaphat
feared, and set himself to seek to Yahweh; and he proclaimed a fast
throughout all Judah.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> Judah gathered themselves
together, to seek <I>help</I> of Yahweh: even out of all the cities of
Judah they came to seek Yahweh.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly
of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Yahweh, before the new court;
 <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> and he said, Yahweh, the
God of our fathers, aren't you God in heaven? and aren't you ruler over
all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is power and might, so
that none is able to withstand you.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Did not you, our God, drive out
the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the
seed of Abraham your friend forever?  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> They lived therein, and have
built you a sanctuary therein for your name, saying,  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> If evil come on us, the sword,
judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and
before you, (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our
affliction, and you will hear and save.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> Now, behold, the children of
Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when
they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and
didn't destroy them;  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> behold, how they reward us, to
come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to
inherit.  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> Our God, will
you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that
comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are on you.
 <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> All Judah stood before
Yahweh, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Then on Jahaziel the son of
Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the
Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Yahweh in the midst of
the assembly;  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> and he
said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you
king Jehoshaphat: Thus says Yahweh to you, Don't be afraid you, neither be
dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours,
but God's.  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> Tomorrow go
you down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and you
shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
 <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> You shall not need to
fight in this <I>battle</I>: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the
salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; don't be afraid, nor
be dismayed: tomorrow go out against them: for Yahweh is with you.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> Jehoshaphat bowed his head with
his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
fell down before Yahweh, worshipping Yahweh.  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> The Levites, of the children of
the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise
Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.  <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> They rose early in the morning,
and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth,
Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, Judah, and you inhabitants of
Jerusalem: believe in Yahweh your God, so you shall be established;
believe his prophets, so you shall prosper.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> When he had taken counsel with
the people, he appointed those who should sing to Yahweh, and give praise
in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to
Yahweh; for his loving kindness endures forever.  <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> When they began to sing and to
praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and
Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.  <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> For the children of Ammon and
Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to kill and
destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
everyone helped to destroy another.  <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> When Judah came to the place
overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they
were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
 <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> When Jehoshaphat and his
people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance
both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off
for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days
in taking the spoil, it was so much.  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> On the fourth day they assembled
themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Yahweh:
therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this
day.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> Then they returned,
every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of
them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to
rejoice over their enemies.  <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> They came to Jerusalem with
stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house of Yahweh.
 <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> The fear of God was on
all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh fought
against the enemies of Israel.  <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was
quiet; for his God gave him rest all around.  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:
he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azubah the
daughter of Shilhi.  <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> He
walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn't turn aside from it, doing
that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh.  <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> However the high places were not
taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of
their fathers.  <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> Now the
rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written
in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of
the kings of Israel.  <a name="C20V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:35</font></a> After this did Jehoshaphat king
of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very
wickedly:  <a name="C20V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:36</font></a> and he joined
himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships
in Ezion Geber.  <a name="C20V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:37</font></a> Then
Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has
destroyed your works. The ships were broken, so that they were not able to
go to Tarshish.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> Jehoshaphat slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and
Jehoram his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> He had brothers, the sons of
Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael,
and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
 <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Their father gave them
great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with
fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he
was the firstborn.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Now
when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had
strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and
various also of the princes of Israel.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> Jehoram was thirty-two years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> He walked in the way of the kings
of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as
wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> However Yahweh would not destroy
the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David,
and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always.
 <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> In his days Edom revolted
from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Then Jehoram passed over with his
captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and
struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the
chariots.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> So Edom
revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day: then did Libnah revolt
at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the
God of his fathers.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> Moreover he made high places in
the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the
prostitute, and led Judah astray.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> There came a writing to him from
Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your
father, Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your
father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> but have walked in the way of
the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
to play the prostitute, like as the house of Ahab did, and also have slain
your brothers of your father's house, who were better than yourself:
 <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> behold, Yahweh will
strike with a great plague your people, and your children, and your wives,
and all your substance;  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> and you shall have great
sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason
of the sickness, day by day.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> Yahweh stirred up against
Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside
the Ethiopians:  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> and they
came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the
substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his
wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest
of his sons.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> After all
this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> It happened, in process of time,
at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his
sickness, and he died of sore diseases. His people made no burning for
him, like the burning of his fathers.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> Thirty-two years old was he when
he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he
departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David,
but not in the tombs of the kings.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> The inhabitants of
Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place; for the band of
men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> Forty-two years old was Ahaziah
when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> He also walked in the ways of the
house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> He did that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors
after the death of his father, to his destruction.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> He walked also after their
counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war
against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded
Joram.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> He returned to be
healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he
fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of
Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was
sick.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> Now the destruction
of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he was come, he
went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had
anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> It happened, when Jehu was
executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of
Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah,
and killed them.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> He
sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and
they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they
said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart.
The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Now when Athaliah the mother of
Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal
seed of the house of Judah.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter
of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among
the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the
bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from
Athaliah, so that she didn't kill him.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> He was with them hid in the
house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> In the seventh year
Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah
the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son
of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
into covenant with him.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> They went about in Judah, and
gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of
fathers' <I>houses</I> of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> All the assembly made a covenant
with the king in the house of God. He said to them, Behold, the king's son
shall reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> This is the thing that you shall
do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of
the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> and a third part shall be at the
king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the
people shall be in the courts of the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> But let none come into the house
of Yahweh, save the priests, and those who minister of the Levites; they
shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the
instruction of Yahweh.  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> The Levites shall surround the
king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the
house, let him be slain: and be you with the king when he comes in, and
when he goes out.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> So the
Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest
commanded: and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on
the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada
the priest didn't dismiss the shift.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> Jehoiada the priest delivered to
the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had
been king David's, which were in the house of God.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> He set all the people, every man
with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left
side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.
 <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> Then they brought out
the king's son, and put the crown on him, and <I>gave him</I> the
testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and
they said, <I>Long</I> live the king.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> When Athaliah heard the noise of
the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the
house of Yahweh:  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> and she
looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the
captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land
rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also <I>played</I> on instruments
of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes,
and said, Treason! treason!  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> Jehoiada the priest brought out
the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them,
Have her forth between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be
slain with the sword: for the priest said, Don't kill her in the house of
Yahweh.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> So they made way
for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's
house: and they killed her there.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> Jehoiada made a covenant between
himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh's
people.  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> All the people
went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his
images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
 <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> Jehoiada appointed the
officers of the house of Yahweh under the hand of the priests the Levites,
whom David had distributed in the house of Yahweh, to offer the burnt
offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing
and with singing, according to the order of David.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> He set the porters at the gates
of the house of Yahweh, that no one who was unclean in anything should
enter in.  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> He took the
captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and
all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of
Yahweh: and they came through the upper gate to the king's house, and set
the king on the throne of the kingdom.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> So all the people of the land
rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Joash was seven years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and
his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> Joash did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> Jehoiada took for him two wives;
and he became the father of sons and daughters.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> It happened after this, that
Joash was minded to restore the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> He gathered together the priests
and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and
gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
year; and see that you hasten the matter. However the Levites didn't
hurry.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> The king called
for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why haven't you required of the
Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the
servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the
testimony?  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> For the sons
of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also
all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh did they bestow on the
Baals.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> So the king
commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> They
made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh
the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
 <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> All the princes and all
the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they
had made an end.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> It was
so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand
of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's
scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took
it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and
gathered money in abundance.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> The king and Jehoiada gave it to
such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired
masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such as
worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> So the workmen worked, and the
work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house
of God in its state, and strengthened it.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> When they had made an end, they
brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were
made vessels for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister
and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered
burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually all the days of
Jehoiada.  <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> But Jehoiada
grew old and was full of days, and he died; one hundred thirty years old
was he when he died.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> They buried him in the city of
David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God
and his house.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> Now after
the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the
king. Then the king listened to them.  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> They forsook the house of
Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols:
and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> Yet he sent prophets to them, to
bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they
would not give ear.  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> The
Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he
stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why disobey you
the commandments of Yahweh, so that you can't prosper? because you have
forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> They conspired against him, and
stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the
house of Yahweh.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> Thus
Joash the king didn't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had
done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, Yahweh look on it,
and require it.  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> It
happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up
against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the
princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of
them to the king of Damascus.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> For the army of the Syrians came
with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into
their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So
they executed judgment on Joash.  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> When they were departed for him
(for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for
the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed,
and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they didn't
bury him in the tombs of the kings.  <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> These are those who conspired
against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the
son of Shimrith the Moabitess.  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> Now concerning his sons, and the
greatness of the burdens <I>laid</I> on him, and the rebuilding of the
house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of
the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Amaziah was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine
years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
 <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Now it happened, when the kingdom
was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the
king his father.  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> But he
didn't put their children to death, but did according to that which is
written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The
fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for
the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah
together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and
Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found
them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could
handle spear and shield.  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> He hired also one hundred
thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of
silver.  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> But there came a
man of God to him, saying, O king, don't let the army of Israel go with
you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, <I>to wit</I>, with all the children
of Ephraim.  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> But if you
will go, do <I>valiantly</I>, be strong for the battle: God will cast you
down before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to cast down.
 <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> Amaziah said to the man
of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to
the army of Israel? The man of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you
much more than this.  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> Then Amaziah separated them,
<I>to wit</I>, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home
again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they
returned home in fierce anger.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> Amaziah took courage, and led
forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the
children of Seir ten thousand.  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> <I>other</I> ten thousand did
the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them to the top of the
rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were
broken in pieces.  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> But
the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with
him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth
Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> Now it happened, after that
Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the
gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
down himself before them, and burned incense to them.  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> Therefore the anger of Yahweh
was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to
him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not
delivered their own people out of your hand?  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> It happened, as he talked with
him, that <I>the king</I> said to him, Have we made you of the king's
counsel? Stop! Why should you be struck down? Then the prophet stopped,
and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have
done this, and have not listened to my counsel.  <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> Then Amaziah king of Judah took
advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of
Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> Joash king of Israel sent to
Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the
cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife:
and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the
thistle.  <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> You say,
Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide
now at home; why should you meddle to <I>your</I> hurt, that you should
fall, even you, and Judah with you?  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> But Amaziah would not hear; for
it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand <I>of their
enemies</I>, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.  <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> So Joash king of Israel went up;
and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth
Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.  <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> Judah was defeated by Israel;
and they fled every man to his tent.  <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> Joash king of Israel took
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth
Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of
Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred
cubits.  <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> <I>He took</I>
all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house
of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages
also, and returned to Samaria.  <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years.  <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> Now the
rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren't they written
in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> Now from the time that Amaziah
did turn away from following Yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and
killed him there.  <a name="C25V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:28</font></a> They
brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of
Judah.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> All the people of
Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the
room of his father Amaziah.  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> He built Eloth, and restored it
to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.  <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when
he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his
mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> He did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
 <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> He set himself to seek
God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God:
and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper.  <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> He went forth and warred against
the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh,
and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in <I>the country of</I>
Ashdod, and among the Philistines.  <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> God helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the
Meunim.  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> The Ammonites
gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of
Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong.  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> Moreover Uzziah built towers in
Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning
<I>of the wall</I>, and fortified them.  <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> He built towers in the
wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the
lowland also, and in the plain: <I>and he had</I> farmers and vineyard
keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming.
 <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Moreover Uzziah had an
army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the
number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the
officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> The whole number of the heads of
fathers' <I>houses</I>, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and
six hundred.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> Under their
hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five
hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the
enemy.  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> Uzziah prepared
for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and
coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> He made in Jerusalem engines,
invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with
which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad; for he
was marvelously helped, until he was strong.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> But when he was strong, his
heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against
Yahweh his God; for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on
the altar of incense.  <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> Azariah the priest went in after
him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:  <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> and they withstood Uzziah the
king, and said to him, It pertains not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to
Yahweh, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn
incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall
it be for your honor from Yahweh God.  <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> Then Uzziah was angry; and he
had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the
priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the
house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.  <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> Azariah the chief priest, and
all the priests, looked on him, and behold, he was leprous in his
forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried
also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> Uzziah the king was a leper to
the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he
was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the
king's house, judging the people of the land.  <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
 <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> So Uzziah slept with his
fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which
belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> Jotham was twenty-five
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in
Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
 <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had
done: however he didn't enter into the temple of Yahweh. The people did
yet corruptly.  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> He built
the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel he built
much.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> Moreover he built
cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles
and towers.  <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> He fought
also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them.
The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of
silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So
much did the children of Ammon render to him, in the second year also, and
in the third.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> So Jotham
became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the
book of the kings of Israel and Judah.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> He was five and twenty years old
when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> Jotham slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his
place.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> Ahaz was twenty years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and
he didn't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his
father;  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> but he walked in
the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the
Baals.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> Moreover he burnt
incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the
fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out
before the children of Israel.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> He sacrificed and burnt incense
in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> Therefore Yahweh his God
delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him, and
carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to
Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
struck him with a great slaughter.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> For Pekah the son of Remaliah
killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them
valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
 <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Zichri, a mighty man of
Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the
house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> The children of Israel carried
away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and
daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil
to Samaria.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> But a prophet
of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army
that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Yahweh, the God of
your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand,
and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.  <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> Now you purpose to keep under
the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids to you:
<I>but</I> aren't there even with you trespasses of your own against
Yahweh your God?  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> Now
hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive
of your brothers; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> Then certain of the heads of the
children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of
Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of
Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> and said to them, You shall not
bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a
trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our
trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> So the armed men left the
captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> The men who have been mentioned
by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who
were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to
eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on
donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their
brothers: then they returned to Samaria.  <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> At that time did king Ahaz send
to the kings of Assyria to help him.  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> For again the Edomites had come
and struck Judah, and carried away captives.  <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> The Philistines also had invaded
the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth
Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah
with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they lived there.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> For Yahweh brought Judah low
because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and
trespassed severely against Yahweh.  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria
came to him, and distressed him, but didn't strengthen him.  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> For Ahaz took away a portion out
of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king and of the
princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it didn't help him.
 <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> In the time of his
distress did he trespass yet more against Yahweh, this same king Ahaz.
 <a name="C28V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:23</font></a> For he sacrificed to the
gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the
kings of Syria helped them, <I>therefore</I> will I sacrifice to them,
that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
 <a name="C28V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:24</font></a> Ahaz gathered together
the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the
house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made
him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.  <a name="C28V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:25</font></a> In every city of Judah he made
high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh,
the God of his fathers.  <a name="C28V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:26</font></a> Now the rest of his acts, and
all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the
kings of Judah and Israel.  <a name="C28V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:27</font></a> Ahaz slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn't bring him
into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his
place.
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> Hezekiah began to
reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years
in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
 <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had
done.  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> He in the first
year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of
Yahweh, and repaired them.  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> He brought in the priests and the
Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
 <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> and said to them, Hear
me, you Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of
Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the
holy place.  <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> For our
fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of
Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces
from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.  <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> Also they have shut up the doors
of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor
offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.  <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was
on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and
forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.
 <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> For, behold, our fathers
have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are
in captivity for this.  <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> Now it is in my heart to make a
covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn
away from us.  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> My sons,
don't be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to
minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense.
 <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> Then the Levites arose,
Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the
Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah
the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and
Eden the son of Joah;  <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> and of the sons of Elizaphan,
Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
 <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> and of the sons of
Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and
Uzziel.  <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> They gathered
their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the
commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of
Yahweh.  <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> The priests went
in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh, to cleanse it, and brought
out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Yahweh into the
court of the house of Yahweh. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad
to the brook Kidron.  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> Now
they began on the first <I>day</I> of the first month to sanctify, and on
the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh; and they
sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of
the first month they made an end.  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> Then they went in to Hezekiah
the king within <I>the palace</I>, and said, We have cleansed all the
house of Yahweh, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels,
and the table of show bread, with all its vessels.  <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> Moreover all the vessels, which
king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared
and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.  <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> Then Hezekiah the king arose
early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of
Yahweh.  <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> They brought
seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a
sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He
commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of
Yahweh.  <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> So they killed
the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the
altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar:
they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> They brought near the male goats
for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their
hands on them:  <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> and the
priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the
altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded
<I>that</I> the burnt offering and the sin offering <I>should be made</I>
for all Israel.  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> He set
the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, with stringed
instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of
Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of
Yahweh by his prophets.  <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> The Levites stood with the
instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.  <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> Hezekiah commanded to offer the
burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of
Yahweh began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of
David king of Israel.  <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> All the assembly worshiped, and
the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this <I>continued</I>
until the burnt offering was finished.  <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> When they had made an end of
offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and
worshiped.  <a name="C29V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:30</font></a> Moreover
Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to
Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises
with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.  <a name="C29V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:31</font></a> Then Hezekiah answered, Now you
have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and
thank offerings into the house of Yahweh. The assembly brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart
<I>brought</I> burnt offerings.  <a name="C29V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:32</font></a> The number of the burnt
offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams,
and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
 <a name="C29V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:33</font></a> The consecrated things
were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.  <a name="C29V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:34</font></a> But the priests were too few, so
that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers
the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests
had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to
sanctify themselves than the priests.  <a name="C29V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:35</font></a> Also the burnt offerings were in
abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink
offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh
was set in order.  <a name="C29V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:36</font></a> Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the
people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the
thing was done suddenly.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> Hezekiah sent to all
Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that
they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover
to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> For the king had taken counsel,
and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover
in the second month.  <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> For
they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people
gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> The thing was right in the eyes
of the king and of all the assembly.  <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> So they established a decree to
make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that
they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at
Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is
written.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> So the posts
went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel
and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You
children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of
the hand of the kings of Assyria.  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> Don't be you like your fathers,
and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> Now don't you be stiff-necked, as
your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his
sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God,
that his fierce anger may turn away from you.  <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> For if you turn again to Yahweh,
your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led
them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is
gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you
return to him.  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> So the
posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and
Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.
 <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> Nevertheless certain men
of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to
Jerusalem.  <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> Also on Judah
came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the
king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh.  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> There assembled at Jerusalem
much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a
very great assembly.  <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> They arose and took away the
altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they
away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.  <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> Then they killed the Passover on
the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the second month: and the priests and the
Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt
offerings into the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> They stood in their place after
their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests
sprinkled the blood <I>which they received</I> of the hand of the Levites.
 <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> For there were many in
the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were
in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to
sanctify them to Yahweh.  <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> For a multitude of the people,
even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed
themselves, yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written.
For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Yahweh pardon everyone
 <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> who sets his heart to
seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, though not <I>cleansed</I>
according to the purification of the sanctuary.  <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and
healed the people.  <a name="C30V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:21</font></a> The
children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of
unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the
priests praised Yahweh day by day, <I>singing</I> with loud instruments to
Yahweh.  <a name="C30V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:22</font></a> Hezekiah spoke
comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding <I>in the
service</I> of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven
days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to
Yahweh, the God of their fathers.  <a name="C30V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:23</font></a> The whole assembly took counsel
to keep other seven days; and they kept <I>other</I> seven days with
gladness.  <a name="C30V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:24</font></a> For Hezekiah
king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls
and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand
bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified
themselves.  <a name="C30V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:25</font></a> All the
assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly
who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of
Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.  <a name="C30V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:26</font></a> So there was great joy in
Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel
there was not the like in Jerusalem.  <a name="C30V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:27</font></a> Then the priests the Levites
arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer
came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> Now when all this was
finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and
broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and broke down the
high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also
and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of
Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
 <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> Hezekiah appointed the
divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man
according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt
offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> <I>He appointed</I> also the
king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, <I>to wit</I>,
for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for
the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is
written in the law of Yahweh.  <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> Moreover he commanded the people
who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites,
that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh.  <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> As soon as the commandment came
abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of
grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field;
and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.  <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> The children of Israel and Judah,
who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of cattle
and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to
Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> In the third month they began to
lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
 <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> When Hezekiah and the
princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and his people
Israel.  <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> Then Hezekiah
questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> Azariah the chief priest, of the
house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since <I>the people</I> began to
bring the offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had
enough, and have left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that
which is left is this great store.  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> Then Hezekiah commanded to
prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh; and they prepared them.  <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> They brought in the offerings
and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah
the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.  <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath,
and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and
Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei
his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the
ruler of the house of God.  <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> Kore the son of Imnah the
Levite, the porter at the east <I>gate</I>, was over the freewill
offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy
things.  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Under him were
Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in
the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their
brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:  <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> besides those who were reckoned
by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who
entered into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required, for
their service in their offices according to their divisions;  <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> and those who were reckoned by
genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from
twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;  <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> and those who were reckoned by
genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their
daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they
sanctified themselves in holiness.  <a name="C31V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:19</font></a> Also for the sons of Aaron the
priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every
city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all
the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy
among the Levites.  <a name="C31V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:20</font></a> Hezekiah did so throughout all
Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before
Yahweh his God.  <a name="C31V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:21</font></a> In every
work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and
in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and
prospered.
<p> <a name="C32V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:1</font></a> After these things,
and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into
Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them
for himself.  <a name="C32V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:2</font></a> When
Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight
against Jerusalem,  <a name="C32V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:3</font></a> he
took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the
springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him.  <a name="C32V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:4</font></a> So there was gathered much people
together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed
through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria
come, and find much water?  <a name="C32V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:5</font></a> He took courage, and built up all
the wall that was broken down, and raised <I>it</I> up to the towers, and
the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo <I>in</I> the city of
David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.  <a name="C32V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:6</font></a> He set captains of war over the
people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate
of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,  <a name="C32V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:7</font></a> Be strong and of good courage,
don't be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the
multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:
 <a name="C32V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:8</font></a> with him is an arm of
flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles.
The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
 <a name="C32V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:9</font></a> After this did
Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was
before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah,
and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,  <a name="C32V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:10</font></a> Thus says Sennacherib king of
Assyria, Whereon do you trust, that you abide the siege in Jerusalem?
 <a name="C32V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:11</font></a> Does not Hezekiah
persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying,
Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 <a name="C32V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:12</font></a> Has not the same
Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah
and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and on it you
shall burn incense?  <a name="C32V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:13</font></a> 
Don't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the
lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to
deliver their land out of my hand?  <a name="C32V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:14</font></a> Who was there among all the gods
of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver
his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
of my hand?  <a name="C32V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:15</font></a> Now
therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this
manner, neither believe you him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was
able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my
fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?  <a name="C32V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:16</font></a> His servants spoke yet more
against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.  <a name="C32V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:17</font></a> He wrote also letters, to rail
on Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the
gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people
out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of
my hand.  <a name="C32V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:18</font></a> They cried with
a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on
the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the
city.  <a name="C32V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:19</font></a> They spoke of the
God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are
the work of men's hands.  <a name="C32V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:20</font></a> Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah
the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
 <a name="C32V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:21</font></a> Yahweh sent an angel,
who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in
the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his
own land. When he was come into the house of his god, those who came forth
from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.  <a name="C32V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:22</font></a> Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of
Assyria, and from the hand of all <I>others</I>, and guided them on every
side.  <a name="C32V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:23</font></a> Many brought gifts
to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so
that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.  <a name="C32V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:24</font></a> In those days Hezekiah was sick
even to death: and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him
a sign.  <a name="C32V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:25</font></a> But Hezekiah
didn't render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart
was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and
Jerusalem.  <a name="C32V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:26</font></a> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled
himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn't come on them in the days of
Hezekiah.  <a name="C32V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:27</font></a> Hezekiah had
exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for
silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for
shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;  <a name="C32V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:28</font></a> storehouses also for the
increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of
animals, and flocks in folds.  <a name="C32V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:29</font></a> Moreover he provided him cities,
and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him
very much substance.  <a name="C32V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:30</font></a> This same Hezekiah also stopped
the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on
the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
 <a name="C32V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:31</font></a> However in <I>the
business of</I> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him
to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try
him, that he might know all that was in his heart.  <a name="C32V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:32</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel.  <a name="C32V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:33</font></a> Hezekiah slept
with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the
sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him
honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> Manasseh was twelve
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in
Jerusalem.  <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> He did that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the
nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.  <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> For he built again the high
places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars
for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky,
and served them.  <a name="C33V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:4</font></a> He built
altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem shall my
name be forever.  <a name="C33V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:5</font></a> He built
altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of
Yahweh.  <a name="C33V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:6</font></a> He also made his
children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and
he practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and
dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked
much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.  <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> He set the engraved image of the
idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David
and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:
 <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> neither will I any more
remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for
your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded
them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances <I>given</I> by
Moses.  <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> Manasseh seduced
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than
did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.
 <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.  <a name="C33V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:11</font></a> Therefore Yahweh brought on them
the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in
chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.  <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> When he was in distress, he
begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his
fathers.  <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> He prayed to
him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought
him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he
was God.  <a name="C33V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:14</font></a> Now after this
he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in
the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel
<I>with it</I>, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put
valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.  <a name="C33V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:15</font></a> He took away the foreign gods,
and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had
built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast
them out of the city.  <a name="C33V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:16</font></a> He
built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace
offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the
God of Israel.  <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> Nevertheless the people
sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.  <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke
to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written
among the acts of the kings of Israel.  <a name="C33V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:19</font></a> His prayer also, and how
<I>God</I> was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the
places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the
engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in
the history of Hozai.  <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> So
Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and
Amon his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C33V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:21</font></a> Amon was twenty-two years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  <a name="C33V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:22</font></a> He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to
all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
them.  <a name="C33V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:23</font></a> He didn't humble
himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but
this same Amon trespassed more and more.  <a name="C33V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:24</font></a> His servants conspired against
him, and put him to death in his own house.  <a name="C33V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:25</font></a> But the people of the land
killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of
the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> Josiah was eight years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
 <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father,
and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.  <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> For in the eighth year of his
reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his
father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from
the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten
images.  <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> They broke down
the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were
on high above them he cut down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images,
and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and
strewed it on the graves <I>of those</I> who had sacrificed to them.
 <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> He burnt the bones of the
priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> <I>So did he</I> in the cities of
Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.
 <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> He broke down the altars,
and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all
the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to
Jerusalem.  <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> Now in the
eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house,
he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city,
and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his
God.  <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> They came to Hilkiah
the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house
of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of
the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> They delivered it into the hand
of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the
workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the
house;  <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> even to the
carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber
for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah
had destroyed.  <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> The men
did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and
Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam,
of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and <I>others of</I> the
Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.  <a name="C34V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:13</font></a> Also they were over the bearers
of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of
service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
 <a name="C34V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:14</font></a> When they brought out
the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest
found the book of the law of Yahweh <I>given</I> by Moses.  <a name="C34V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:15</font></a> Hilkiah answered Shaphan the
scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah
delivered the book to Shaphan.  <a name="C34V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:16</font></a> Shaphan carried the book to the
king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was
committed to your servants, they are doing.  <a name="C34V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:17</font></a> They have emptied out the money
that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand
of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.  <a name="C34V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:18</font></a> Shaphan the scribe told the
king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read
therein before the king.  <a name="C34V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:19</font></a> It happened, when the king had
heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.  <a name="C34V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:20</font></a> The king commanded Hilkiah, and
Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,  <a name="C34V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:21</font></a> Go you, inquire of Yahweh for
me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the
words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is
poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to
do according to all that is written in this book.  <a name="C34V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:22</font></a> So Hilkiah, and they whom the
king <I>had commanded</I>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe;
(now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her
to that effect.  <a name="C34V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:23</font></a> She said
to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent
you to me,  <a name="C34V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:24</font></a> Thus says
Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants,
even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read
before the king of Judah.  <a name="C34V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:25</font></a> Because they have forsaken me,
and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger
with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on
this place, and it shall not be quenched.  <a name="C34V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:26</font></a> But to the king of Judah, who
sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, Thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,  <a name="C34V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:27</font></a> because your heart was tender,
and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against
this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before
me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you,
says Yahweh.  <a name="C34V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:28</font></a> Behold, I
will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave
in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on
this place, and on its inhabitants. They brought back word to the king.
 <a name="C34V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:29</font></a> Then the king sent and
gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.  <a name="C34V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:30</font></a> The king went up to the house of
Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he
read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was
found in the house of Yahweh.  <a name="C34V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:31</font></a> The king stood in his place, and
made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart,
and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were
written in this book.  <a name="C34V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:32</font></a> He
caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand <I>to it</I>.
The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God
of their fathers.  <a name="C34V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:33</font></a> Josiah
took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to
the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve,
even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn't depart from
following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
<p> <a name="C35V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:1</font></a> Josiah kept a Passover
to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth
<I>day</I> of the first month.  <a name="C35V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:2</font></a> He set the priests in their
offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh.
 <a name="C35V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:3</font></a> He said to the Levites
who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the
house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall
no more be a burden on your shoulders: now serve Yahweh your God, and his
people Israel.  <a name="C35V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:4</font></a> Prepare
yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions, according to the
writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon
his son.  <a name="C35V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:5</font></a> Stand in the
holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your
brothers the children of the people, and <I>let there be for each</I> a
portion of a fathers' house of the Levites.  <a name="C35V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:6</font></a> Kill the Passover, and sanctify
yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of
Yahweh by Moses.  <a name="C35V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:7</font></a> Josiah
gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of
them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of
thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king's
substance.  <a name="C35V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:8</font></a> His princes
gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the
Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God,
gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six
hundred <I>small livestock</I>, and three hundred head of cattle.  <a name="C35V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:9</font></a> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and
Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of
the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand
<I>small livestock</I>, and five hundred head of cattle.  <a name="C35V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:10</font></a> So the service was prepared, and
the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions,
according to the king's commandment.  <a name="C35V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:11</font></a> They killed the Passover, and
the priests sprinkled <I>the blood which they received</I> of their hand,
and the Levites flayed them.  <a name="C35V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:12</font></a> They removed the burnt
offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the
fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it
is written in the book of Moses. So did they with the cattle.  <a name="C35V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:13</font></a> They roasted the Passover with
fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in
pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the
children of the people.  <a name="C35V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:14</font></a> Afterward they prepared for
themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron
<I>were busied</I> in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until
night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests
the sons of Aaron.  <a name="C35V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:15</font></a> The
singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the
commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer;
and the porters were at every gate: they didn't need to depart from their
service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.  <a name="C35V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:16</font></a> So all the service of Yahweh was
prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings
on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
 <a name="C35V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:17</font></a> The children of Israel
who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of
unleavened bread seven days.  <a name="C35V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:18</font></a> There was no Passover like that
kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the
kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and
the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <a name="C35V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:19</font></a> In the eighteenth year of the
reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.  <a name="C35V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:20</font></a> After all this, when Josiah had
prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against
Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.  <a name="C35V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:21</font></a> But he sent ambassadors to him,
saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? <I>I come</I> not
against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God
has commanded me to make haste: forbear you from <I>meddling with</I> God,
who is with me, that he not destroy you.  <a name="C35V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:22</font></a> Nevertheless Josiah would not
turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with
him, and didn't listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and
came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.  <a name="C35V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:23</font></a> The archers shot at king Josiah;
and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
 <a name="C35V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:24</font></a> So his servants took him
out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and
brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his
fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.  <a name="C35V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:25</font></a> Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:
and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their
lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and
behold, they are written in the lamentations.  <a name="C35V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:26</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law
of Yahweh,  <a name="C35V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:27</font></a> and his acts,
first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
Israel and Judah.
<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> Then the people of the
land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's
place in Jerusalem.  <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> Joahaz was twenty-three years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> The king of Egypt deposed him at
Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent
of gold.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> The king of
Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed
his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to
Egypt.  <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> Jehoiakim was
Twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his
God.  <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> Against him came up
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to
Babylon.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> Nebuchadnezzar
also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put
them in his temple at Babylon.  <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in
him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> Jehoiachin was eight years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in
Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> At the return of the year king
Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels
of the house of Yahweh, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
Jerusalem.  <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> Zedekiah was
twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem:  <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> and he did
that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God; he didn't humble
himself before Jeremiah the prophet <I>speaking</I> from the mouth of
Yahweh.  <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> He also rebelled
against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he
stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the
God of Israel.  <a name="C36V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:14</font></a> Moreover
all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly
after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of
Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem.  <a name="C36V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:15</font></a> Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending,
because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
 <a name="C36V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:16</font></a> but they mocked the
messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets,
until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people, until there was no
remedy.  <a name="C36V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:17</font></a> Therefore he
brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with
the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young
man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
 <a name="C36V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:18</font></a> All the vessels of the
house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to
Babylon.  <a name="C36V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:19</font></a> They burnt the
house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its
palaces with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it.  <a name="C36V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:20</font></a> He carried those who had escaped
from the sword away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons
until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:  <a name="C36V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:21</font></a> to fulfill the word of Yahweh by
the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths: <I>for</I>
as long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
 <a name="C36V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:22</font></a> Now in the first year of
Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah
might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and
<I>put it</I> also in writing, saying,  <a name="C36V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:23</font></a> Thus says Cyrus king of Persia,
All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and
he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him,
and let him go up.

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
