<h1>
Haggai
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> In the second year of
Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the
Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the
high priest, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;This is what Yahweh of
Armies says: These people say, 'The time hasn't yet come, the time for
Yahweh's house to be built.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Then the Word of Yahweh
came by Haggai, the prophet, saying,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> &quot;Is it a time for you
yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies waste?
 <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Now therefore this is what
Yahweh of Armies says: Consider your ways.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> You have sown much, and bring in
little. You eat, but you don't have enough. You drink, but you aren't
filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who
earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> This is what Yahweh of
Armies says: &quot;Consider your ways.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Go up to the mountain, bring wood,
and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be
glorified,&quot; says Yahweh.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> &quot;You looked for much, and,
behold, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away.
Why?&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;Because of my house that lies
waste, while each of you is busy with his own house.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Therefore for your sake the
heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> I called for a drought on the
land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that
which the ground brings forth, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor
of the hands.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Then Zerubbabel, the
son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with
all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh, their God, and
the words of Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him; and
the people feared Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Then Haggai, Yahweh's
messenger, spoke Yahweh's message to the people, saying, &quot;I am with
you,&quot; says Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Yahweh stirred up the
spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the
spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of
all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of
Yahweh of Armies, their God,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> in the twenty-fourth day of the
month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> In the seventh month,
in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai
the prophet, saying,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> &quot;Speak now to Zerubbabel, the
son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> 'Who is left among you who saw
this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn't it in your
eyes as nothing?  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Yet now
be strong, Zerubbabel,' says Yahweh. 'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak,
the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' says Yahweh, 'and
work, for I am with you,' says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> This is the word that I covenanted
with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. 'Don't
be afraid.'  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> For this is
what Yahweh of Armies says: 'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will
shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> and I will shake all nations. The
precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with
glory, says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> The silver is mine, and the gold
is mine,' says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> 'The latter glory of this house
will be greater than the former,' says Yahweh of Armies; 'and in this
place will I give peace,' says Yahweh of Armies.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> In the twenty-fourth
day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh
came by Haggai the prophet, saying,  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> &quot;Thus says Yahweh of Armies:
Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> 'If someone carries holy meat in
the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil,
or any food, will it become holy?'&quot;
<p>The priests answered, &quot;No.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Then Haggai said,
&quot;If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these,
will it be unclean?&quot;
<p>The priests answered, &quot;It will be unclean.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Then Haggai answered,
&quot;'So is this people, and so is this nation before me,' says Yahweh;
'and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is
unclean.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Now, please
consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in
the temple of Yahweh.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Through all that time, when one
came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to
the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> I struck you with blight, mildew,
and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn't turn to me,' says
Yahweh.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> 'Consider,
please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the
ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was
laid, consider it.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Is the
seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and
the olive tree haven't brought forth. From this day will I bless
you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The Word of Yahweh
came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month,
saying,  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> &quot;Speak to
Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, 'I will shake the heavens and the
earth.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> I will overthrow
the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the
nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The
horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his
brother.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> In that day,
says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of
Shealtiel,' says Yahweh, 'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen
you,' says Yahweh of Armies.&quot;

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our

eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
