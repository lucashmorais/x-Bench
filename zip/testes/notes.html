<h3>NOTES</h3>
</center>

<br>
<center>INTRODUCTION</center>

<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page ix">He was born
. . . at Pallas.</a> This is the usual account. But it was
maintained by the family of the poet's mother, and has been
contended (by Dr. Michael F. Cox in a Lecture on 'The Country and
Kindred of Oliver Goldsmith,' published in vol. 1, pt. 2, of the
<cite>Journal</cite> of the 'National Literary Society of Ireland.'
1900) that his real birth-place was the residence of Mrs.
Goldsmith's parents, Smith-Hill House, Elphin, Roscommon, to which
she was in the habit of paying frequent visits. Meanwhile, in 1897,
a window was placed to Goldsmith's memory in Forgney Church,
Longford,&mdash;the church of which, at the time of his birth, his
father was curate.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page x">his academic
career was not a success.</a> 'Oliver Goldsmith is recorded on two
occasions as being remarkably diligent at Morning Lecture; again,
as cautioned for bad answering at Morning and Greek Lectures; and
finally, as put down into the next class for neglect of his
studies' (Dr. Stubbs's <cite>History of the University of
Dublin</cite>, 1889, p. 201 n.)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xi">a scratched
signature upon a window-pane.</a> This, which is now at Trinity
College, Dublin, is here reproduced in facsimile. When the garrets
of No. 35, Parliament Square, were pulled down in 1837, it was cut
out of the window by the last occupant of the rooms, who broke it
in the process. (Dr. J. F. Waller in Cassell's <cite>Works</cite>
of Goldsmith, [1864-5], pp. xiii-xiv n.)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xiii">a poor
physician.</a> Where he obtained his diploma is not known. It was
certainly not at Padua (<cite>Athenaeum</cite>, July 21, 1894). At
Leyden and Louvain Prior made inquiries but, in each case, without
success. The annals of the University of Louvain were, however,
destroyed in the revolutionary wars. (Prior, <cite>Life</cite>,
1837, i, pp. 171, 178).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xv.">declared it
to be by Goldsmith.</a> Goldsmith's authorship of this version has
now been placed beyond a doubt by the publication in facsimile of
his signed receipt to Edward Dilly for</p>

share amounting to 6 pounds 13s. 4d. The receipt, which belongs to
Mr. J. W. Ford of Enfield Old Park, is dated 'January 11th, 1758.'

Arbour Court, Old Bailey.</a> This was a tiny square occupying a
site now absorbed by the Holborn Viaduct and Railway Station. No.
12, where Goldsmith lived, was later occupied by Messrs. Smith,
Elder &amp; Co. as a printing office. An engraving of the Court
forms the frontispiece to the <cite>European Magazine</cite> for

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xvii">or some of
his imitators.</a> The proximate cause of the <i>Citizen of the
World</i>, as the present writer has suggested elsewhere, <i>
may</i> have been Horace Walpole's <cite>Letter from XoHo</cite>
[Soho?], <i>a Chinese Philosopher at London, to his friend Lien
Chi, at Peking</i>. This was noticed as 'in Montesquieu's manner'
in the May issue of the <cite>Monthly Review</cite> for 1757, to
which Goldsmith was a contributor (<cite>Eighteenth Century
Vignettes</cite>, first series, second edition, 1897, pp.
108-9).</p>

to the musical glasses (ch. ix), which were the rage in 1761-2; and
to the <cite>Auditor</cite> (ch. xix) established by Arthur Murphy
in June of the latter year. The sale of the 'Vicar' is discussed at
length in chapter vii of the editor's <cite>Life of Oliver
Goldsmith</cite> ('Great Writers' series), 1888, pp. 110-21.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xxii">started
with a loss.</a> This, which to some critics has seemed
unintelliglble, rests upon the following: 'The first three
editions, . . . resulted in a loss, and the fourth, which was not
issued until eight [four?] years after the first, started with a
balance against it of &pound;2 16s. 6d., and it was not until that
fourth edition had been sold that the balance came out on the right
side' (<cite>A Bookseller of the Last Century</cite> [John Newbery]
by Charles Welsh, 1885, p. 61). The writer based his statement upon
Collins's 'Publishing book, account of books printed and shares
therein, No. 3, 1770 to 1785.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="introduction.html#page xxvii">James's
Powder.</a> This was a famous patent panacea, invented by Johnson's
Lichfield townsman, Dr. Robert James of the <cite>Medicinal
Dictionary</cite>. It was sold by John Newbery, and had an
extraordinary vogue. The King dosed Princess Elizabeth with it;
Fielding, Gray, and Cowper all swore by it, and Horace Walpole, who
wished to try it upon Mme. du Deffand <i>in extremis</i>,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">said he should use it if the house were on fire.
William Hawes, the Strand apothecary who attended Goldsmith, wrote
an interesting <i>Account of the late Dr. Goldsmith's Illness, so
far as relates to the Exhibition of Dr. James's Powders,</i> etc.,
1774, which he dedicated to Reynolds and Burke. To Hawes once
belonged the poet's worn old wooden writing-desk, now in the South
Kensington Museum, where are also his favourite chair and cane.
Another desk- chair, which had descended from his friend, Edmund
Bott, was recently for sale at Sotheby's (July, 1906).</p>

<br>
 

<center>EDITIONS OF THE POEMS.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No collected edition of Goldsmith's poetical
works appeared until after his death. But, in 1775, W. Griffin, who
had published the <cite>Essays</cite> of ten years earlier, issued
a volume entitled <cite>The Miscellaneous Works of Oliver
Goldsmith, M.B., containing all his Essays and Poems</cite>. The
'poems' however were confined to 'The Traveller,' 'The Deserted
Village,' 'Edwin and Angelina,' 'The Double Transformation,' 'A New
Simile,' and 'Retaliation,'&mdash;an obviously imperfect
harvesting. In the following year G. Kearsly printed an eighth
edition of <cite>Retaliation</cite>, with which he included 'The
Hermit' ('Edwin and Angelina'), 'The Gift,' 'Madam Blaize,' and the
epilogues to <cite>The Sister</cite> and <cite>She stoops to
Conquer</cite>;* while to an edition of <cite>The Haunch of
Venison</cite>, also put forth in 1776, he added the 'Epitaph on
Parnell' and two songs from the oratorio of <cite>The
Captivity</cite>. The next collection appeared in a volume of
<cite>Poems and Plays</cite> published at Dublin in 1777, where it
was preceded by a 'Life,' written by W. Glover, one of Goldsmith's
'Irish clients.' Then, in 1780, came vol. i of T. Evans's <cite>
Poetical and Dramatic Works, etc., now first collected</cite>, also
having a 'Memoir,' and certainly fuller than anything which had
gone before. Next followed the long-deferred <cite>Miscellaneous
Works,</cite> etc., of 1801, in four volumes, vol. ii of which
comprised the plays and poems. Prefixed to this edition is the
important biographical sketch, compiled under the direction of
Bishop Percy, and usually described as the <cite>Percy
Memoir</cite>, by which title it is referred to in the ensuing</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*Some copies of this are dated 1777, and
contain <cite>The Haunch of Venison</cite> and a few minor
pieces.</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">notes. The next memorable edition was that
edited for the Aldine Series in 1831, by the Rev. John Mitford.
Prior and Wright's edition in vol. iv of the <cite>Miscellaneous
Works</cite>, etc., of 1837, comes after this; then Bolton Corney's
excellent <cite>Poetical Works</cite> of 1845; and vol. i of Peter
Cunningham's <cite>Works</cite>, etc. of 1854. There are other
issues of the poems, the latest of which is to be found in vol. ii
(1885) of the complete <cite>Works</cite>, in five volumes, edited
for Messrs. George Bell and Sons by J. W. M. Gibbs.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Most of the foregoing editions have been
consulted for the following notes; but chiefly those of Mitford,
Prior, Bolton Corney, and Cunningham. Many of the illustrations and
explanations now supplied will not, however, be found in any of the
sources indicated. When an elucidatory or parallel passage is
cited, an attempt has been made, as far as possible, to give the
credit of it to the first discoverer. Thus, some of the
illustrations in Cunningham's notes are here transferred to Prior,
some of Prior's to Mitford, and so forth. As regards the notes
themselves, care has been taken to make them full enough to obviate
the necessity, except in rare instances, of further investigation.
It is the editor's experience that references to external
authorities are, as a general rule, sign-posts to routes which are
seldom travelled.*</p>

<br>
<center>THE TRAVELLER.</center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It was on those continental wanderings which
occupied Goldsmith between February, 1755 and February, 1756 that
he conceived his first idea of this, the earliest of his poems to
which he prefixed his name; and he probably had in mind Addison's
<cite>Letter from Italy to Lord Halifax</cite>, a work in which he
found 'a strain of political thinking that was, at that time
[1701]. new in our poetry.' (<cite>Beauties of English
Poesy</cite>, 1767, i. III). From the dedicatory letter to his
brother&mdash;which says expressly, 'as a part of this Poem was
formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with
propriety, be only inscribed</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*In this connexion may be recalled the
dictum of Hume quoted by Dr. Birkbeck Hill:&mdash;'Every book
should be as complete as possible within itself, and should never
refer for anything material to other books' (<cite>History of
England</cite>, 1802, ii. 101).</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">to you'&mdash;it is plain that some portion of
it must have been actually composed abroad. It was not, however,
actually published until the 19th of December, 1764, and the title-
page bore the date of 1765.* The publisher was John Newbery, of St.
Paul's Churchyard, and the price of the book, a quarto of 30 pages,
was 1s. 6d. A second, third and fourth edition quickly followed,
and a ninth, from which it is here reprinted, was issued in 1774,
the year of the author's death. Between the first and the sixth
edition of 1770 there were numerous alterations, the more important
of which are indicated in the ensuing notes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The didactic purpose of <cite>The
Traveller</cite> is defined in the concluding paragraph of the
<cite>Dedication</cite>; and, like many of the thoughts which it
contains, had been anticipated in a passage</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>*This is the generally recognized first
edition. But the late Mr. Frederick Locker Lampson, the poet and
collector, possessed a quarto copy, dated 1764, which had no
author's name, and in which the dedication ran as
follows:&mdash;'This poem is inscribed to the Rev. Henry Goldsmith,
M.A. By his most affectionate Brother Oliver Goldsmith.' It was, in
all probability, unique, though it is alleged that there are octavo
copies which present similar characteristics. It has now gone to
America with the Rowfant Library.</small></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><small>In 1902 an interesting discovery was made
by Mr. Bertram Dobell, to whom the public are indebted for so many
important literary 'finds.' In a parcel of pamphlets he came upon a
number of loose printed leaves entitled <cite>A Prospect of
Society</cite>. They obviously belonged to <cite>The
Traveller</cite>; but seemed to be its 'formless unarranged
material,' and contained many variations from the text of the first
edition. Mr. Dobell's impression was that 'the author's manuscript,
written on loose leaves, had fallen into confusion, and was then
printed without any attempt at re-arrangement.' This was near the
mark; but the complete solution of the riddle was furnished by Mr.
Quiller Couch in an article in the <cite>Daily News</cite> for
March 31, 1902, since recast in his charming volume <cite>From a
Cornish Window</cite>, 1906, pp. 86-92. He showed conclusively that
<cite>The Prospect</cite> was 'merely an early draft of <cite>The
Traveller</cite> printed backwards in fairly regular sections.'
What had manifestly happened was this. Goldsmith, turning over each
page as written, had laid it on the top of the preceding page of
MS. and forgotten to rearrange them when done. Thus the series of
pages were reversed; and, so reversed, were set up in type by a
matter-of-fact compositor. Mr. Dobell at once accepted this happy
explanation; which&mdash;as Mr. Quiller Couch points out&mdash;has
the advantage of being a 'blunder just so natural to Goldsmith as
to be almost postulable.' One or two of the variations of Mr.
Dobell's 'find'&mdash;variations, it should be added, antecedent to
the first edition&mdash;are noted in their places.</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">of <cite>The Citizen of the World</cite>, 1762,
i. 185:&mdash;'Every mind seems capable of entertaining a certain
quantity of happiness, which no institutions can encrease, no
circumstances alter, and entirely independent on fortune.' But the
best short description of the poem is Macaulay's:&mdash;'In the
<cite>Traveller</cite> the execution, though deserving of much
praise, is far inferior to the design. No philosophical poem,
ancient or modern, has a plan so noble, and at the same time so
simple. An English wanderer, seated on a crag among the Alps, near
the point where three great countries meet, looks down on the
boundless prospect, reviews his long pilgrimage, recalls the
varieties of scenery, of climate, of government, of religion, of
national character, which he has observed, and comes to the
conclusion, just or unjust, that our happiness depends little on
political institutions, and much on the temper and regulation of
our own minds.' (<cite>Encyclop. Britannica</cite>, Goldsmith,
February, 1856.)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The only definite record of payment for <cite>
The Traveller</cite> is 'Copy of the Traveller, a Poem,
21<i>l</i>,' in Newbery's MSS.; but as the same sum occurs in
Memoranda of much later date than 1764, it is possible that the
success of the book may have prompted some supplementary fee.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 3">A
Prospect</a>, i.e. 'a view.' 'I went to Putney, and other places on
the Thames, to take 'prospects' in crayon, to carry into France,
where I thought to have them engraved' (Evelyn, <cite>Diary</cite>,
20th June, 1649). And Reynolds uses the word of Claude in his
Fourth Discourse:&mdash;'His pictures are a composition of the
various draughts which he had previously made from various
beautiful scenes and prospects' (<cite>Works</cite>, by Malone,
1798, i. 105). The word is common on old prints, e.g. <cite>An
Exact Prospect of the Magnificent Stone Bridge at
Westminster</cite>, etc., 1751.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 3">
Dedication.</a> The Rev. Henry Goldsmith, says the Percy <cite>
Memoir</cite>, 1801, p. 3, 'had distinguished himself both at
school and at college, but he unfortunately married at the early
age of nineteen; which confined him to a Curacy, and prevented his
rising to preferment in the church.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 3">with an income
of forty pounds a year.</a> Cf. <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>,
ll. 141-2:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Cf. also Parson Adams in ch. iii of <cite>Joseph
Andrews</cite>, who has twenty- three; and Mr. Rivers, in the
<cite>Spiritual Quixote</cite>, 1772:&mdash;'I do not choose to go
into orders to be a curate all my life-time, and work for about
fifteen- pence a day, or twenty-five pounds a year' (bk. vi, ch.
xvii). Dr. Primrose's stipend is thirty-five in the first instance,
fifteen in the second (<cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, chapters ii
and iii). But Professor Hales (<cite>Longer English Poems</cite>,
1885, p. 351) supplies an exact parallel in the case of Churchill,
who, he says, when a curate at Rainham, 'prayed and starved on <i>
forty pounds a year</i>.' The latter words are Churchill's own, and
sound like a quotation; but he was dead long before <cite>The
Deserted Village</cite> appeared in 1770. There is an interesting
paper in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for November, 1763,
on the miseries and hardships of the 'inferior clergy.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 3">But of all
kinds of ambition, etc.</a> In the first edition of 1765, p. ii,
this passage was as follows:&mdash;'But of all kinds of ambition,
as things are now circumstanced, perhaps that which pursues
poetical fame, is the wildest. What from the encreased refinement
of the times, from the diversity of judgments produced by opposing
systems of criticism, and from the more prevalent divisions of
opinion influenced by party, the strongest and happiest efforts can
expect to please but in a very narrow circle. Though the poet were
as sure of his aim as the imperial archer of antiquity, who boasted
that he never missed the heart; yet would many of his shafts now
fly at random, for the heart is too often in the wrong place.' In
the second edition it was curtailed; in the sixth it took its final
form.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 4">Such readers
generally admire, etc.</a> 'I suppose this paragraph to be directed
against Paul Whitehead, or Churchill,' writes Mitford. It was
clearly aimed at Churchill, since Prior (<cite>Life</cite>, 1837,
ii. 54) quotes a portion of a contemporary article in the <cite>St.
James's Chronicle</cite> for February 7-9, 1765, attributed to
Bonnell Thornton, which leaves little room for doubt upon the
question. 'The latter part of this paragraph,' says the writer,
referring to the passage now annotated, 'we cannot help considering
as a reflection on the memory of the late Mr. Churchill, whose
talents as a poet were so greatly and so deservedly admired, that
during his short reign, his merit in great measure eclipsed that of
others; and we think it no mean acknowledgment of the excellencies
of this poem [<cite>The Traveller</cite>] to say that, like the
stars, they appear the more brilliant now that the sun of our
poetry is gone down.' Churchill died on the 4th of November, 1764,
some weeks before the publication of <cite>The Traveller</cite>.
His powers, it may be, were misdirected and misapplied; but his
rough vigour and his manly verse deserved a better fate at
Goldsmith's hands.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 4">tawdry</a> was

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 4">blank

1759, p. 150&mdash;'From a desire in the critic of grafting the
spirit of ancient languages upon the English, has proceeded of late
several disagreeable instances of pedantry. Among the number, I
think we may reckon <i>blank verse</i>. Nothing but the greatest
sublimity of subject can render such a measure pleasing; however,
we now see it used on the most trivial occasions'&mdash;by which
last remark Goldsmith probably, as Cunningham thinks, intended to
refer to the efforts of Akenside, Dyer, and Armstrong. His views
upon blank verse were shared by Johnson and Gray. At the date of
the present dedication, the latest offender in this way had been
Goldsmith's old colleague on <cite>The Monthly Review</cite>, Dr.
James Grainger, author of <cite>The Sugar Cane</cite>, which was
published in June, 1764. (Cf. also <cite>The Bee</cite> for 24th

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 5">slow.</a> A
well-known passage from Boswell must here be
reproduced:&mdash;'Chamier once asked him [Goldsmith], what he

<pre>
          Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Did he mean tardiness of locomotion? Goldsmith,
who would say something without consideration, answered "yes." I
[Johnson] was sitting by, and said, "No, Sir, you do not mean
tardiness of locomotion; you mean, that sluggishness of mind which
comes upon a man in solitude." Chamier believed then that I had
written the line as much as if he had seen me write it.' [Birkbeck
Hill's <cite>Boswell</cite>, 1887, iii. 252- 3.) It is quite
possible, however, that Goldsmith meant no more than he said.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">After having been for some time announced as in
preparation, <cite>The Deserted Village</cite> made its first
appearance on May 26, 1770.* It was received with great enthusiasm.
In June a second, third, and fourth edition followed, and in August
a fifth was published. The text here given is that of the fourth
edition, which was considerably revised. Johnson, we are told,
thought <cite>The Deserted Village</cite> inferior to <cite>The
Traveller</cite>: but 'time,' to use Mr. Forster's words, 'has not
confirmed <i>that</i> judgment.' Its germ is perhaps to be found in
ll. 397-402 of the earlier poem.</p>

rather duodecimo) editions all dated 1770; and ostensibly printed
for 'W. Griffin, at Garrick's Head, in Catherine-street, Strand.'
He rightly describes their existence as 'a bibliographical puzzle.'
They afford no important variations; are not mentioned by the early
editors; and are certainly not in the form in which the poem was
first advertised and reviewed, as this was a quarto. But they are
naturally of interest to the collector; and the late Colonel
Francis Grant, a good Goldsmith scholar, described one of them in
the <cite>Athenaeum</cite> for June 20, 1896 (No.

<p align="JUSTIFY">Much research has been expended in the endeavour
to identify the scene with Lissoy, the home of the poet's youth
(see <i>Introduction</i>, p. ix); but the result has only been
partially successful. The truth seems that Goldsmith, living in
England, recalled in a poem that was English in its conception many
of the memories and accessories of his early life in Ireland,
without intending or even caring to draw an exact picture. Hence,
as Lord Macaulay has observed, in a much criticized and
characteristic passage, 'it is made up of incongruous parts. The
village in its happy days is a true English village. The village in
its decay is an Irish village. The felicity and the misery which
Goldsmith has brought close together belong to two different
countries, and to two different stages in the progress of society.
He had assuredly never seen in his native island such a rural
paradise, such a seat of plenty, content, and tranquillity, as his
"Auburn." He had assuredly never seen in England all the
inhabitants of such a paradise turned out of their homes in one day
and forced to emigrate in a body to America. The hamlet he had
probably seen in Kent; the ejectment he had probably seen in
Munster; but, by joining the two, he has produced something which
never was and never will be seen in any part of the world.'
(<cite>Encyclop. Britannica</cite>, 1856.) It is obvious also that
in some of his theories&mdash;the depopulation of the kingdom, for
example&mdash;Goldsmith was mistaken. But it was not for its
didactic qualities then, nor is it for them now, that <cite>The
Deserted Village</cite>' delighted and delights. It maintains its
popularity by its charming <i>genre</i>-pictures, its sweet and
tender passages, its simplicity, its sympathetic hold upon the
enduring in human nature. To test it solely with a view to
establish its topographical accuracy, or to insist too much upon
the value of its ethical teaching, is to mistake its real mission
as a work of art.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="descriptive.html#page 21">Dedication. I
am ignorant of that art in which you are said to excel.</a> This
modest confession did not prevent Goldsmith from making fun of the
contemporary connoisseur. See the letter from the young virtuoso in
<cite>The Citizen of the World</cite>, 1762, i. 145, announcing
that a famous 'torse' has been discovered to be not 'a Cleopatra
bathing' but 'a Hercules spinning'; and Charles Primrose's

of <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>, took its origin from the
circumstance of general Robert Napper [Napier or Naper], (the
grandfather of the gentleman who now [1807] lives in the house,
within half a mile of Lissoy, and built by the general) having
purchased an extensive tract of the country surrounding Lissoy, or
<i>Auburn</i>; in consequence of which many families, here called
<i>cottiers</i>, were removed, to make room for the intended
improvements of what was now to become the wide domain of a rich
man, warm with the idea of changing the face of his new
acquisition; and were forced, "<i>with fainting steps,</i>" to go
in search of "<i>torrid tracts</i>" and "<i>distant
climes.</i>"'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Prior (<cite>Life</cite>, 1837, i. 40-3) points
out that Goldsmith was not the first to give poetical expression to
the wrongs of the dispossessed Irish peasantry; and he quotes a
long extract from the <cite>Works</cite> (1741) of a Westmeath
poet, Lawrence Whyte, which contains such passages as
these:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        Their native soil were forced to quit,
        So Irish landlords thought it fit;
        Who without ceremony or rout,
        For their improvements turn'd them out ...

        How many villages they razed,
        How many parishes laid waste ...

his entering the College [i.e. Trinity College, Dublin], to read

French of Saint-Pavin (i.e. Denis Sanguin de Saint-Pavin, d. 1670),
whose works were edited in 1759, the year in which Goldsmith
published the collection of essays and verses in which it is to be

<p align="JUSTIFY">Quebec was taken on the 13th September, 1759.
Wolfe was wounded pretty early in the action, while leading the
advance of the Louisbourg grenadiers. 'A shot shattered his wrist.
He wrapped his handkerchief about it and kept on. Another shot
struck him, and he still advanced, when a third lodged in his
breast. He staggered, and sat on the ground. Lieutenant Brown, of
the grenadiers, one Henderson, a volunteer in the same company, and
a private soldier, aided by an officer of artillery who ran to join
them, carried him in their arms to the rear. He begged them to lay
him down. They did so, and asked if he would have a surgeon.
"There's no need," he answered; "it's all over with me." A moment
after, one of them cried out, "They run; see how they run!" "Who
run?" Wolfe demanded, like a man roused from sleep. "The enemy,
sir. They give way everywhere!" "Go, one of you, to Colonel
Burton," returned the dying man; "tell him to march Webb's regiment
down to Charles River, to cut off their retreat from the bridge."

peace!" and in a few moments his gallant soul had fled.' (Parkman's
<cite>Montcalm and Wolfe</cite>, 1885, ii. 296-7.) In his <cite>
History of England in a Series of Letters</cite>, 1764, ii. 241,
Goldsmith says of this event:&mdash;'Perhaps the loss of such a man
was greater to the nation than the conquering of all Canada was
advantageous; but it is the misfortune of humanity, that we can
never know true greatness till the moment when we are going to lose
it.'* The present stanzas were first published in <cite>The Busy
Body</cite> (No. vii) for Tuesday, the 22nd October, 1759, a week
after the news of Wolfe's death had reached this country (Tuesday
the 16th). According to Prior (<cite>Life</cite>, 1837, i. 6),
Goldsmith claimed to be related to Wolfe by the father's side, the
maiden name of the General's mother being Henrietta Goldsmith. It
may be noted that Benjamin West's popular rendering of Wolfe's
death (1771)&mdash;a rendering which Nelson never passed in a print
shop without being stopped by it&mdash;was said to be based upon
the descriptions of an eye- witness. It was engraved by Woollett
and Ryland in 1776. A key to the names of those appearing in the
picture was published in the <cite>Army and Navy Gazette</cite> of

BLAIZE.</a></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The publication in February, 1751, of Gray's
<cite>Elegy Wrote in a Country Church Yard</cite> had set a fashion
in poetry which long continued. Goldsmith, who considered that work
'a very fine poem, but overloaded with epithet' (<cite>Beauties of
English Poesy</cite>, 1767, i. 53), and once proposed to amend it
'by leaving out an idle word in every line' [!] (Cradock's <cite>
Memoirs</cite>, 1826, i. 230), resented these endless imitations,
and his antipathy to them frequently reveals itself. Only a few
months before the appearance of Mrs. Blaize in <cite>The Bee</cite>
for October 27, 1759, he had written in the <cite>Critical
Review</cite>, vii. 263, when noticing Langhorne's <cite>Death of

head of his thundering legions, or reining Pegasus in his most
rapid career; they are sure to strew cypress enough upon the bier,
dress up all the muses in mourning, and look themselves every whit
as dismal and sorrowful as an undertaker's shop.' He returned to
the subject in a <cite>Chinese Letter</cite> of March 4, 1761, in
the <cite>Public Ledger</cite> (afterwards Letter ciii of <cite>The
Citizen of the World</cite>, 1762, ii. 162-5), which contains the
lines <cite>On the Death of the Right Honourable ***</cite>; and
again, in <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, 1766, i. 174, <i>
&agrave; propos</i> of the <cite>Elegy on the Death of a Mad
Dog</cite>, he makes Dr. Primrose say, 'I have wept so much at all
sorts of elegies of late, that without an enlivening glass I am
sure this will overcome me.'</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The model for <cite>An Elegy on Mrs. Mary
Blaize</cite> is to be found in the old French popular song of
Monsieur de la Palisse or Palice, about fifty verses of which are
printed in Larousse's <cite>Grand Dictionnaire Universel du
XIX</cite> me <cite>Si&egrave;cle</cite>, x. p. 179. It is there
stated to have originated in some dozen stanzas suggested to la
Monnoye (<i>v. supra</i>, p. 193) by the extreme artlessness of a
military quatrain dating from the battle of Pavia, and the death
upon that occasion of the famous French captain, Jacques de
Chabannes, seigneur de la Palice:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        Monsieur d'La Palice est mort,

<p align="JUSTIFY">The remaining verses, i.e. in addition to those
of la Monnoye, are the contributions of successive generations.
Goldsmith probably had in mind the version in Part iii of the
<cite>M&eacute;nagiana</cite>, (ed. 1729, iii, 384-391) where
apparently by a typographical error, the hero is called <i>'le
fameux la Galisse, homme imaginaire.'</i> The verses he imitated
most closely are reproduced below. It may be added that this poem
supplied one of its last inspirations to the pencil of Randolph
Caldecott, who published it as a picture-book in October, 1885.

Mrs. Castle, who was 'the daughter of one Burton, a broom-man . . .

Surrey. It was a poor neighbourhood corresponding to the present

<p align="JUSTIFY">This ballad, usually known as <cite>The

in that year 'for the amusement of the Countess of Northumberland,'
whose acquaintance Goldsmith had recently made through Mr. Nugent.
(See the prefatory note to <cite>The Haunch of Venison</cite>.) Its
title was '<cite>Edwin and Angelina. A Ballad</cite>. By Mr.
Goldsmith.' It was first published in <cite>The Vicar of

July, 1767, Goldsmith was accused [by Dr. Kenrick] in the <cite>St.

<p align="JUSTIFY">taken a Ballad, I published some Time ago, from
one by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great
Resemblance between the two Pieces in Question. If there be any,
his Ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy some Years
ago, and he (as we both considered these Things as Trifles at best)
told me, with his usual Good Humour, the next Time I saw him, that
he had taken my Plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare into a
Ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may so
call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty Anecdotes as these
are scarce worth printing, and were it not for the busy Disposition
of some of your Correspondents, the Publick should never have known
that he owes me the Hint of his Ballad, or that I am obliged to his
Friendship and Learning for Communications of a much more important
Nature.&mdash;I am, Sir, your's etc. O<small>LIVER</small>
G<small>OLDSMITH</small>.' (<cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>,
July 23-5, 1767.) No contradiction of this statement appears to
have been offered by Percy; but in re-editing his <cite>Reliques of
Ancient English Poetry</cite> in 1775, shortly after Goldsmith's
death, he affixed this note to <cite>The Friar of Orders
Gray</cite>:&mdash;'As the foregoing song has been thought to have
suggested to our late excellent poet, Dr. Goldsmith, the plan of
his beautiful ballad of <cite>Edwin and Emma</cite>
[<cite>Angelina</cite>], first printed [published?] in his <cite>
Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, it is but justice to his memory to
declare, that his poem was written first, and that if there is any
imitation in the case, they will be found both to be indebted to
the beautiful old ballad, <cite>Gentle Herdsman, etc.</cite>,
printed in the second volume of this work, which the doctor had
much admired in manuscript, and has finely improved' (vol. i. p.
250). The same story is told, in slightly different terms, at pp.
74-5 of the <cite>Memoir</cite> of Goldsmith drawn up under Percy's
superintendence for the <cite>Miscellaneous Works</cite> of 1801,
and a few stanzas of <cite>Gentle Herdsman</cite>, which Goldsmith
is supposed to have had specially in mind, are there reproduced.
References to them will be found in the ensuing notes. The text
here adopted (with exception of ll. 117-20) is that of the fifth
edition of <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, 1773[4], i. pp.
78-85; but the variations of the earlier version of 1765 are duly
chronicled, together with certain hitherto neglected differences

<center><a href="lyrical.html#page 65">AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A
MAD DOG.</a></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This poem was first published in <cite>The Vicar
of Wakefield</cite>, 1766, i. 175- 6, where it is sung by one of
the little boys. In common with the <cite>Elegy on Mrs. Mary
Blaize</cite> (p. 47) it owes something of its origin to
Goldsmith's antipathy to fashionable elegiacs, something also to
the story of M. de la Palisse. As regards mad dogs, its author
seems to have been more reasonable than many of his contemporaries,
since he ridiculed, with much common sense, their exaggerated fears
on this subject (<cite>v. Chinese Letter</cite> in <cite>The Public
Ledger</cite> for August 29, 1760, afterwards Letter lxvi of <cite>
The Citizen of the World</cite>, 1762, ii. 15). But it is ill
jesting with hydrophobia. Like <cite>Madam Blaize</cite>, these
verses have been illustrated by Randolph Caldecott.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="lyrical.html#page 65">In Islington
there was a man.</a> Goldsmith had lodgings at Mrs. Elizabeth
Fleming's in Islington (or 'Isling town' as the earlier editions
have it) in 1763- 4; and the choice of the locality may have been
determined by this circumstance. But the date of the composition of
the poem is involved in the general obscurity which hangs over the
<i>Vicar</i> in its unprinted state. (See <a href=

<center><a href="lyrical.html#page 67">SONG</a><br>
 <small>FROM 'THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.'</small></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">First published in <cite>The Vicar of
Wakefield</cite>, 1766, ii. 78 (chap. v). It is there sung by
Olivia Primrose, after her return home with her father. 'Do, my
pretty Olivia,' says Mrs. Primrose, let us have that little
melancholy air your pappa was so fond of, your sister Sophy has
already obliged us. Do child, it will please your old father.' 'She
complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic,' continues Dr.
Primrose, 'as moved me.' The charm of the words, and the graceful
way in which they are introduced, seem to have blinded criticism to
the impropriety, and even inhumanity, of requiring poor Olivia to
sing a song so completely applicable to her own case. No source has
been named for this piece; and its perfect conformity with the text
would appear to indicate that Goldsmith was not indebted to any
earlier writer for his idea.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">His well-known obligations to French sources
seem, however, to have suggested that, if a French original could
not be discovered for the foregoing lyric, it might be desirable to
invent one. A clever paragraphist in the <cite>St. James's
Gazette</cite> for January 28th, 1889, accordingly reproduced the
following stanzas, which he alleged, were to be found in the poems
of Segur, 'printed in Paris in 1719':&mdash;</p>

</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a correspondent was not slow to point out,
Goldsmith, if a copyist, at all events considerably improved his
model (see in particular lines 7 and 8 of the French). On the 30th
of the month the late Sir William Fraser gave it as his opinion,
that, until the volume of 1719 should be produced, the 'very
inferior verses quoted' must be classed with the fabrications of
'Father Prout,' and he instanced that very version of the <cite>
Burial of Sir John Moore</cite> (<cite>Les Fun&eacute;railles de
Beaumanoir</cite>) which has recently (August 1906) been going the
round of the papers once again. No S&eacute;gur volume of 1719 was,
of course, forthcoming.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Kenrick, as we have already seen, had in 1767
accused Goldsmith of taking <cite>Edwin and Angelina</cite> from
Percy (p. 206). Thirty years later, the charge of plagiarism was
revived in a different way when <cite>Raimond and
Ang&eacute;line</cite>, a French translation of the same poem,
appeared, as Goldsmith's original, in a collection of Essays called
<cite>The Quiz</cite>, 1797. It was eventually discovered to be a
translation 'from' Goldsmith by a French poet named L&eacute;onard,
who had included it in a volume dated 1792, entitled <cite>Lettres
de deux Amans, Habitans de Lyon</cite> (Prior's <cite>Life</cite>,
1837, ii. 89-94). It may be added that, according to the <cite>
Biographie Universelle</cite>, 1847, vol. 18 (Art. 'Goldsmith'),
there were then no fewer than at least three French imitations of
<cite>The Hermit</cite> besides L&eacute;onard's.</p>

The old building of the College of Physicians was in Warwick Lane;
and the reference is to the long-pending dispute, occasionally
enlivened by personal collision, between the Fellows and
Licentiates respecting the exclusion of certain of the latter from
Fellowships. On this theme Bonnell Thornton, himself an M.B. like
Goldsmith, wrote a satiric additional canto to Garth's <cite>
Dispensary</cite>, entitled <cite>The Battle of the Wigs</cite>,
long extracts from which are printed in <cite>The Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> for March, 1768, p. 132. The same number also
reviews <cite>The Siege of the Castle of &AElig;sculapius, an
heroic Comedy, as it is acted in Warwick- Lane</cite>. Goldsmith's
couplet is, however, best illustrated by the title of one of
Sayer's caricatures, <cite>The March of the Medical Militants to
the Siege of Warwick-Lane-Castle in the Year</cite> 1767. The
quarrel was finally settled in favour of the college in June,

<p align="JUSTIFY"><cite>The Sister</cite>, produced at Covent
Garden February 18, 1769, was a comedy by Mrs. Charlotte Lenox or
Lennox, 'an ingenious lady,' says <cite>The Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> for April in the same year, 'well known in the
literary world by her excellent writings, particularly the Female
Quixote, and Shakespeare illustrated. . . . The audience expressed
their disapprobation of it with so much clamour and appearance of
prejudice, that she would not suffer an attempt to exhibit it a
second time (p. 199).' According to the</p>

<center><a name="page 216"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">same authority it was based upon one of the
writer's own novels, <cite>Henrietta</cite>, published in 1758.
Though tainted with the prevailing sentimentalism, <cite>The
Sister</cite> is described by Forster as 'both amusing and
interesting'; and it is probable that it was not fairly treated
when it was acted. Mrs. Lenox (1720-1804), daughter of Colonel
Ramsay, Lieut.-Governor of New York, was a favourite with the
literary magnates of her day. Johnson was half suspected of having
helped her in her book on Shakespeare; Richardson admitted her to
his readings at Parson's Green; Fielding, who knew her, calls her,
in the <cite>Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon</cite>, 1755, p. 35
(first version), 'the inimitable author of the Female Quixote'; and
Goldsmith, though he had no kindness for genteel comedy (see <i>
post</i>, p. 228), wrote her this lively epilogue, which was spoken
by Mrs. Bulkley, who personated the 'Miss Autumn' of the piece.
Mrs. Lenox died in extremely reduced circumstances, and was buried
by the Right Hon. George Ross, who had befriended her later years.
There are several references to her in Boswell's <cite>Life of
Johnson</cite>. (See also Hawkins' <cite>Life</cite>, 2nd ed. 1787,
pp. 285-7.)</p>

'ZOBEIDE.'</a></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><cite>Zobeide</cite>, a play by Joseph Cradock
(1742-1826), of Gumley, in Leicestershire, was produced by Colman
at Covent Garden on Dec. 11, 1771. It was a translation from three
acts of <cite>Les Scythes</cite>, an unfinished tragedy by
Voltaire. Goldsmith was applied to, through the Yates's, for a
prologue, and sent that here printed to the author of the play with
the following note:&mdash;'Mr. Goldsmith presents his best respects
to Mr. Cradock, has sent him the Prologue, such as it is. He cannot
take time to make it better. He begs he will give Mr. Yates the
proper instructions; and so, even so, commits him to fortune and
the publick.' (Cradock's <cite>Memoirs</cite>, 1826, i. 224.)
Yates, to the acting of whose wife in the character of the heroine
the success of the piece, which ran for thirteen nights, was mainly
attributable, was to have spoken the prologue, but it ultimately
fell to Quick, later the 'Tony Lumpkin' of <cite>She Stoops to
Conquer</cite>, who delivered it in the character of a sailor.

<p align="JUSTIFY"><cite>Retaliation: A Poem. By Doctor Goldsmith.
Including Epitaphs on the Most Distinguished Wits of this
Metropolis</cite>, was first published by G. Kearsly in April,
1774, as a 4to pamphlet of 24 pp. On the title-page is a vignette
head of the author, etched by James Basire, after Reynolds's
portrait; and the verses are prefaced by an anonymous letter to the
publisher, concluding as follows:&mdash;'Dr. Goldsmith <i>belonged
to a Club of</i> Beaux Esprits, <i>where Wit sparkled sometimes at
the Expence of Good-nature.</i></p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page 223"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>It was proposed to write Epitaphs on the
Doctor; his Country, Dialect and Person, furnished Subjects of
Witticism.&mdash;The Doctor was called on for' Retaliation, 'and at
their next Meeting produced the following Poem, which I think adds
one Leaf to his immortal Wreath.</i> This account seems to have
sufficed for Evans, Percy, and the earlier editors. But in vol. i.
p. 78 of his edition of Goldsmith's <cite>Works</cite>, 1854, Mr.
Peter Cunningham published for the first time a fuller version of
the circumstances, derived from a manuscript lent to him by Mr.
George Daniel of Islington; and (says Mr. Cunningham) 'evidently
designed as a preface to a collected edition of the poems which
grew out of Goldsmith's trying his epigrammatic powers with
Garrick.' It is signed 'D. Garrick.' 'At a meeting'&mdash;says the
writer&mdash;'of a company of gentlemen, who were well known to
each other, and diverting themselves, among many other things, with
the peculiar oddities of Dr. Goldsmith, who would never allow a
superior in any art, from writing poetry down to dancing a
horn-pipe, the Dr. with great eagerness insisted upon trying his
epigrammatic powers with Mr. Garrick, and each of them was to write
the other's epitaph. Mr. Garrick immediately said that his epitaph
was finished, and spoke the following distich extempore:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        Here lies NOLLY Goldsmith, for shortness call'd Noll,
        Who wrote like an angel, but talk'd like poor Poll.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Goldsmith, upon the company's laughing very
heartily, grew very thoughtful, and either would not, or could not,
write anything at that time: however, he went to work, and some
weeks after produced the following printed poem called <cite>
Retaliation</cite>, which has been much admired, and gone through
several editions.' This account, though obviously from Garrick's
point of view, is now accepted as canonical, and has superseded
those of Davies, Cradock, Cumberland, and others, to which some
reference is made in the ensuing notes. A few days after the
publication of the first edition, which appeared on the 18th or
19th of April, a 'new' or second edition was issued, with four
pages of 'Explanatory Notes, Observations, etc.' At the end came
the following announcement:&mdash;'G. Kearsly, the Publisher,
thinks it his duty to declare, that</p>

<hr>
<center><a name="page 224"><font color="#000000"><i>page

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Goldsmith wrote the Poem as it is here
printed, a few errors of the press excepted, which are taken notice
of at the bottom of this page.' From this version <cite>
Retaliation</cite> is here reproduced. In the third edition,
probably in deference to some wounded susceptibilities, the too
comprehensive 'most Distinguished Wits of the Metropolis' was
qualified into '<i>some of the most</i> Distinguished Wits,' etc.,
but no further material alteration was made in the text until the
suspicious lines on Caleb Whitefoord were added to the fifth
edition.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With the exception of Garrick's couplet, and the
fragment of Whitefoord referred to at p. 234, none of the original
epitaphs upon which Goldsmith was invited to 'retaliate' have
survived. But the unexpected ability of the retort seems to have
prompted a number of <i>ex post facto</i> performances, some of
which the writers would probably have been glad to pass off as
their first essays. Garrick, for example, produced three short
pieces, one of which ('Here, Hermes! says Jove, who with nectar was
mellow') hits off many of Goldsmith's contradictions and foibles
with considerable skill (<i>v.</i> Davies's <cite>Garrick</cite>,
2nd ed., 1780, ii. 157). Cumberland (<cite>v. Gent. Mag.</cite>,
Aug. 1778, p. 384) parodied the poorest part of <cite>
Retaliation</cite>, the comparison of the guests to dishes, by
likening them to liquors, and Dean Barnard in return rhymed upon
Cumberland. He wrote also an apology for his first attack, which is
said to have been very severe, and conjured the poet to set his wit
at Garrick, who, having fired his first shot, was keeping out of
the way:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
         On him let all thy vengeance fall;
          On me you but misplace it:
        Remember how he called thee <i>Poll</i>&mdash;
          But, ah! he dares not face it.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For these, and other forgotten pieces arising
out of <cite>Retaliation</cite>, Garrick had apparently prepared
the above-mentioned introduction. It may be added that the
statement, prefixed to the first edition, that ^Retaliation^, as we
now have it, was produced at the 'next meeting' of the Club, is
manifestly incorrect. It was composed and circulated in detached
fragments, and Goldsmith was still working at it when he was seized
with his last illness.</p>

Addison at the beginning, as it was to Goldsmith and his friends at
the end of the eighteenth century, was the last house but one on
the south- west corner of St. James's Street. It now no longer

Sir Joshua illuminated the dean's verses with a sketch of his bust

Sentimental</i> Comedy, in which the virtues of Private Life are
exhibited, rather than the Vices exposed; and the Distresses rather
than the Faults of Mankind, make our interest in the piece. . . .
In these Plays almost all the Characters are good, and exceedingly
generous; they are lavish enough of their <i>Tin</i> Money on the
Stage, and though they want Humour, have abundance of Sentiment and
Feeling. If they happen to have Faults or Foibles, the Spectator is
taught not only to pardon, but to applaud them, in consideration of
the goodness of their hearts; so that Folly, instead of being
ridiculed, is commended, and the Comedy aims at touching our
Passions without the power of being truly pathetic.'
(<cite>Westminster Magazine</cite>, 1772, i. 5.) Cf. also the
<cite>Preface to The Good Natur'd Man</cite>, where he 'hopes that
too much refinement will not banish humour and character from
our's, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the
French comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental, that
it has not only banished humour and <cite>Moliere</cite> from the

<cite>The School for Wives</cite>, 1774, and other <i>sentimental

in Garrick's prologue as a 'Sermon,' 'preach'd in Acts,' was
produced at Drury Lane just six days before Goldsmith's comedy of
<cite>The Good Natur'd Man</cite> appeared at Covent Garden, and
obtained a success which it ill deserved. <cite>False
Delicacy</cite>&mdash;said Johnson truly (Birkbeck Hill's <cite>

character,'&mdash;a crushing accusation to make against a drama.
But Garrick, for his private ends, had taken up Kelly as a rival to
Goldsmith; and the <i>com&eacute;die s&eacute;rieuse</i> or <i>
larmoyante</i> of La Chauss&eacute;e, Sedaine, and Diderot had
already found votaries in England. <cite>False Delicacy</cite>,
weak, washy, and invertebrate as it was, completed the

the works he had ever published of his own' (Northcote's <cite>Life

(Letter to Montagu, December 12, 1766). To use Voltaire's

<p align="JUSTIFY">These lines, which appear at p. 312 of vol. V of
the <cite>History of the Earth and Animated Nature</cite>, 1774,
are freely translated from some Latin verses by Addison in No 412
of the <cite>Spectator</cite>, where they are introduced as
follows:&mdash;'Thus we see that every different Species of
sensible Creatures has its different Notions of Beauty, and that
each of them is most affected with the Beauties of its own kind.
This is nowhere more remarkable than in Birds of the same Shape and
Proportion, where we often see the Male determined in his Courtship
by the single Grain or Tincture of a Feather, and never discovering
any Charms but in the Colour of its own Species.' Addison's lines,
of which Goldsmith translated the first fourteen only, are printed
from his corrected MS. at p. 4 of <cite>Some Portions of Essays
contributed to the Spectator by Mr. Joseph Addison</cite> [by the
late J. Dykes Campbell], 1864.</p>

<center><a href="lyrical.html#page 95">THE HAUNCH OF
VENISON.</a></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is supposed that this poem was written early
in 1771, although it was not printed until 1776, when it was
published by G. Kearsly and J. Ridley under the title of <cite>The
Haunch of Venison, a Poetical Epistle to the Lord Clare. By the
late Dr. Goldsmith. With a Head of the Author, Drawn by Henry
Bunbury, Esq; and Etched by</cite> [<i>James</i>] <cite>
Bretherton.</cite> A second edition, the text of which is here
followed, appeared in the same year 'With considerable Additions
and Corrections, Taken from the Author's <i>last</i> Transcript.'
The Lord Clare to whom the verses are addressed was Robert Nugent,
of Carlanstown, Westmeath, M.P. for St. Mawes in 1741-54. In 1766
he was created Viscount Clare; in 1776 Earl Nugent. In his youth he
had himself been an easy if not very original versifier; and there
are several of his performances in the second volume of Dodsley's
<cite>Collection of Poems by Several Hands</cite>, 4th ed., 1755.
One of the Epistles, beginning 'Clarinda, dearly lov'd, attend The
Counsels of a faithful friend,' seems to have betrayed Goldsmith
into the blunder of confusing it, in the <cite>Poems for Young
Ladies</cite>. 1767, p. 114, with Lyttelton's better-known <cite>
Advice to a Lady</cite> ('The counsels of</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">a friend, Belinda, hear'), also in Dodsley's
miscellany; while another piece, an <cite>Ode to William Pultney,
Esq.</cite>, contains a stanza so good that Gibbon worked it into
his character of Brutus:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        What tho' the good, the brave, the wise,
        With adverse force undaunted rise,
          To break th' eternal doom!
        Tho' CATO liv'd, tho' TULLY spoke,
        Tho' BRUTUS dealt the godlike stroke,
          Yet perish'd fated ROME.
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Detraction, however, has insinuated that Mallet,
his step-son's tutor, was Nugent's penholder in this instance. 'Mr.
Nugent sure did not write his own Ode,' says Gray to Walpole
(Gray's <cite>Works</cite>, by Gosse, 1884, ii. 220). Earl Nugent
died in Dublin in October, 1788, and was buried at Gosfield in
Essex, a property he had acquired with his second wife. A <i>
Memoir</i> of him was written in 1898 by Mr. Claud Nugent. He is
described by Cunningham as 'a big, jovial, voluptuous Irishman,
with a loud voice, a strong Irish accent, and a ready though coarse
wit.' According to Percy (<cite>Memoir</cite>, 1801, p. 66), he had
been attracted to Goldsmith by the publication of <cite>The
Traveller</cite> in 1764, and he mentioned him favourably to the
Earl of Northumberland, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A note in
Forster's <cite>Life</cite>, 1871, ii. 329-30, speaks of Goldsmith
as a frequent visitor at Gosfield, and at Nugent's house in Great
George Street, Westminster, where he had often for playmate his
host's daughter, Mary, afterwards Marchioness of Buckingham.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Scott and others regarded <cite>The Haunch of
Venison</cite> as autobiographical. To what extent this is the
case, it is difficult to say. That it represents the actual thanks
of the poet to Lord Clare for an actual present of venison, part of
which he promptly transferred to Reynolds, is probably the fact.
But, as the following notes show, it is also clear that Goldsmith
borrowed, if not his entire fable, at least some of its details
from Boileau's third satire; and that, in certain of the lines, he
had in memory Swift's <cite>Grand Question Debated</cite>, the
measure of which he adopts. This throws more than a doubt upon the
truth of the whole. 'His genius' (as Hazlitt says) 'was a mixture
of originality and imitation'; and fact and fiction often mingle
inseparably</p>

the <cite>Good Natur'd Man</cite> was quite capable of inventing
for the nonce the tragedy of the unbaked pasty, or of selecting
from the Pilkingtons and Purdons of his acquaintance such
appropriate guests for his Mile End Amphitryon as the writers of
the <cite>Snarler</cite> and the <cite>Scourge</cite>. It may
indeed even be doubted whether, if <cite>The Haunch of
Venison</cite> had been absolute personal history, Goldsmith would
ever have retailed it to his noble patron at Gosfield, although it
may include enough of real experience to serve as the basis for a

<p align="JUSTIFY">Cunningham quotes a similar idea from T. Brown's
<cite>Laconics, Works</cite>, 1709, iv. 14. 'To treat a poor wretch
with a bottle of Burgundy, or fill his snuff-box, is like giving a
pair of lace ruffles to a man that has never a shirt on his back.'
But Goldsmith, as was his wont, had already himself employed the
same figure. 'Honours to one in my situation,' he says in a letter
to his brother Maurice, in January, 1770, when speaking of his
appointment as Professor of Ancient History to the Royal Academy,
'are something like ruffles to a man that wants a shirt'
(<cite>Percy Memoir</cite>, 1801, 87-8). His source was probably,
not Brown's <cite>Laconics</cite>, but those French 'ana' he knew
so well. According to M. J. J. Jusserand (<cite>English Essays from
a French Pen</cite>, 1895, pp. 160-1), the originator of this
conceit was M. Samuel de Sorbieres, the traveller in England who
was assailed by Bishop Sprat. Considering himself inadequately
rewarded by his patrons, Mazarin, Louis XIV, and Pope Clement IX,
he said bitterly&mdash;'They give lace cuffs to a man without a
shirt'; a 'consolatory witticism' which he afterwards remodelled
into, 'I wish they would send me bread for the butter they kindly
provided me with.' In this form it appears in the Preface to the

Lord Bute and his policy over the signature of 'Anti-Sejanus.'
'Sandwich and his parson Anti-Sejanus [are] hooted off the

Prior, it was Scott who visited Goldsmith in his Temple chambers,

wrote a <cite>Life of Thomas Parnell, D.D.</cite>, to accompany an
edition of his poems, printed for Davies of Russell Street. Parnell
was born in 1679, and died at Chester in 1718, on his way to
Ireland. He was buried at Trinity Church in that town, on the 24th
of October. Goldsmith says that his father and uncle both knew
Parnell (<cite>Life of Parnell</cite>, 1770, p. v), and that he
received assistance from the poet's nephew, Sir John Parnell, the
singing gentleman who figures in Hogarth's <cite>Election

an anonymous letter to Garrick in 1759, and translated the <cite>

to have revised, and his own life of Voltaire was to have
accompanied it, though finally the Memoir and Translation seem to

sincerely for your Epilogue, which, however could not be used, but
with your permission, shall be printed.* The story in short is
this; Murphy sent me rather the outline of an Epilogue than an
Epilogue, which was to be sung by Mrs. Catley, and which she
approved. Mrs. Bulkley hearing this, insisted on throwing up her
part, unless according to the custom of the theatre, she were
permitted to speak the Epilogue. In this embarrassment I thought of
making a quarrelling Epilogue between Catley and her, debating who
should speak the Epilogue, but then Mrs. Catley refused, after I
had taken the trouble of drawing it out. I was then at a loss
indeed; an Epilogue was to be made, and for none but Mrs. Bulkley.
I made one, and Colman thought it too bad to be spoken; I was
obliged therefore to try a fourth time, and I made a very mawkish
thing, as you'll shortly see. Such is the history of my Stage

<p align="JUSTIFY">According to Prior (<cite>Miscellaneous

train.</a> The Macaronies were the foplings, fribbles, or beaux of
Goldsmith's day. Walpole refers to them as early as 1764; but their
flourishing time was 1770-3, when the print-shops, and especially
Matthew Darly's in the Strand, No. 39, swarmed with satirical
designs of which they were the subject. Selwyn, March&mdash;many
well-known names&mdash;are found in their ranks. Richard Cosway
figured as 'The Macaroni Painter'; Angelica Kauffmann as 'The
Paintress of Maccaroni's'; Thrale as 'The Southwark Macaroni.'
Another caricature ('The Fluttering Macaroni') contains a portrait
of Miss Catley, the singing actress of the present epilogue; while
Charles Horneck, the brother of 'The Jessamy Bride' (see p. 251, l.
14) is twice satirized as 'The Martial Macaroni' and 'The Military
Macaroni.' The name, as may be guessed, comes from the Italian dish
first made fashionable by the 'Macaroni Club,' being afterwards
applied by extension to 'the younger and gayer part of our nobility
and gentry, who, at the same time that they gave in to the luxuries
of eating, went equally into the extravagancies of dress.'

presenting a burlesque sentimental Comedy called <cite>The Handsome
Housemaid; or, Piety in Pattens</cite>, which did as much as <cite>
She Stoops</cite> to laugh false sentiment away. Foote warned his
audience that they would not discover 'much wit or humour' in the
piece, since 'his brother writers had all agreed that it was highly
improper, and beneath the dignity of a mixed assembly, to show any
signs of joyful satisfaction; and that creating a laugh was forcing
the higher order of an audience to a vulgar and mean use of their
muscles'&mdash;for which reason, he explained, he had, like them,
given up the sensual for the sentimental style. And thereupon

influence of Foote's Aristophanic ridicule, and the <i>

Goldsmith himself had prepared the way in a paper contributed to
the <cite>Westminster Magazine</cite> for December, 1772 (vol. i.
p. 4), with the title of 'An Essay on the Theatre; or, A Comparison

of fennel, and nosegays before 'em.</a> This was a custom dating
from the fearful jail fever of 1750, which carried off, not only
prisoners, but a judge (Mr. Justice Abney) 'and many jurymen and
witnesses.' 'From that time up to this day [i.e. 1855] it has been
usual to place sweet-smelling herbs in the prisoner's dock, to
prevent infection.' (Lawrence's <cite>Life of Henry
Fielding</cite>, 1855, p. 296.) The close observation of Cruikshank
has not neglected this detail in the Old Bailey plate of <cite>The

a contrition suitable to our worthlessness, some pretty young
ladies in <i>mobs</i>, popped in here and there about the church.'
(<cite>Guardian</cite>, No. 65, May 26, 1713.) Cf. also Addison's
'Fine Lady's Diary' (<cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 323); 'Went in our

<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="captivity.html#page 133">Sir
Charles,</a> i.e. Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, Bart., M. P., Henry
Bunbury's elder brother. He succeeded to the title in 1764, and
died without issue in 1821. Goldsmith, it may be observed, makes
'Charles' a disyllable. Probably, like many of his countrymen, he
so pronounced it. (Cf. Thackeray's <cite>Pendennis</cite>, 1850,
vol. ii, chap. 5 [or xliii], where this is humorously illustrated
in Captain Costigan's 'Sir <i>Chorlus</i>, I saw your neem at the
Levee.' Perhaps this accounts for 'failing' and
'stealing,'&mdash;'day on' and 'Pantheon,' in the ^New Simile^.
Cooke (<cite>European Magazine</cite>, October, 1793, p. 259) says
that Goldsmith 'rather cultivated (than endeavoured to get rid of)
his brogue.'</p>

primarily to colour with the scarlet or purple dye produced by the

similarity to small seeds. Being what is styled a 'fast' dye the
phrase is used by extension to signify permanence.</p>

CHESS.</a></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Forster thus describes the MS. of this poem in
his <cite>Life of Goldsmith</cite>:&mdash;'It is a small quarto
manuscript of thirty- four pages, containing 679 lines, to which a
fly-leaf is appended in which Goldsmith notes the differences of
nomenclature between Vida's chessmen and our own. It has occasional
interlineations and corrections, but such as would occur in
transcription rather than in a first or original copy. Sometimes
indeed choice appears to have been made (as at page 29) between two
words equally suitable to the sense and verse, as "to" for
"toward"; but the insertions and erasures refer almost wholly to
words or lines accidentally omitted and replaced. The triplet is
always carefully marked; and seldom as it is found in any other of
Goldsmith's poems. I am disposed to regard its frequent recurrence
here as even helping, in some degree, to explain the motive which
had led him to the trial of an experiment in rhyme comparatively
new to him. If we suppose him, half consciously, it may be, taking
up the manner of the great master of translation, Dryden, who was
at all times so much a favourite with him, he would at least, in so
marked a peculiarity, be less apt to fall short than to err perhaps
a little on the side of excess. Though I am far from thinking such
to be the result in the present instance. The effect of the whole
translation is pleasing to me, and the mock-heroic effect I think
not a little assisted by the reiterated use of the triplet and
alexandrine. As to any evidence of authorship derivable from the
appearance of the manuscript, I will only add another word. The
lines in the translation have been carefully counted, and the
number is marked in Goldsmith's hand at the close of his
transcription. Such a fact is, of course, only to be taken in aid
of other proof; but a man is not generally at the pains of
counting, still less, I should say in such a case as Goldsmith's,
of elaborately transcribing, lines which are not his own.'
(Forster's <cite>Goldsmith</cite>, 1871, ii. 235-6).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When Forster wrote the above, the MS. was in the
possession of Mr. Bolton Corney, who had not been aware of its
existence when he edited Goldsmith's Poems in 1845. In 1854 it was,
with his permission, included in vol. iv of Cunningham's <cite>
Works</cite> of 1854, and subsequently in the Aldine <cite>
Poems</cite> of 1866.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mark Jerome Vida of Cremona, 1490-1566, was
Bishop of Alba, and favourite of Leo the Magnificent. Several
translators had tried their hand at his <cite>Game of Chess</cite>
before Goldsmith. Lowndes mentions Rowbotham, 1562; Jeffreys, 1736;
Erskine, 1736; Pullin, 1750; and <cite>Anon</cite>. (Eton), 1769
(who may have preceded Goldsmith). But after his (Goldsmith's)
death appeared another Oxford anonymous version, 1778, and one by
Arthur Murphy, 1786.</p>
