<h1>
Genesis
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> In the beginning <a
href="#N1">God</a> created the heavens and the earth.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Now the earth was formless and
empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering
over the surface of the waters.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> God said, &quot;Let
there be light,&quot; and there was light.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> God saw the light, and saw that it
was good. God divided the light from the darkness.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> God called the light Day, and the
darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> God said, &quot;Let
there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the
waters from the waters.&quot;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> God made the expanse, and divided
the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above
the expanse; and it was so.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> God called the expanse sky. There
was evening and there was morning, a second day.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> God said, &quot;Let the
waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry
land appear;&quot; and it was so.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> God called the dry land Earth,
and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it
was good.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> God said,
&quot;Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees
bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;&quot;
and it was so.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> The earth
brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees
bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it
was good.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> There was
evening and there was morning, a third day.
<p> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> God said, &quot;Let
there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night;
and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> and let them be for
lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;&quot; and it was
so.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> God made the two
great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night. He also made the stars.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> God set them in the expanse of
sky to give light to the earth,  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> and to rule over the day and over
the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was
good.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> There was evening
and there was morning, a fourth day.
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> God said, &quot;Let
the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above
the earth in the open expanse of sky.&quot;  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> God created the large sea
creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters
swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw
that it was good.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> God
blessed them, saying, &quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters
in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&quot;  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> There was evening and there was
morning, a fifth day.
<p> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> God said, &quot;Let
the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock,
creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;&quot; and it
was so.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> God made the
animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind,
and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it
was good.
<p> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> God said, &quot;Let us
make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the
livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
creeps on the earth.&quot;  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> God created man in his own image.
In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> God blessed them. God said to
them, &quot;Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have
dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over
every living thing that moves on the earth.&quot;  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> God said, &quot;Behold, I have
given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the
earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your
food.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> To every animal of
the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on
the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for
food;&quot; and it was so.
<p> <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> God saw everything
that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and
there was morning, a sixth day.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> The heavens and the
earth were finished, and all their vast array.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> On the seventh day God finished
his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his
work which he had made.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> God blessed the seventh day, and
made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had
created and made.
<p> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> This is the history of
the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in
the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> No plant of the field was yet in
the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had
not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the
ground,  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> but a mist went up
from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Yahweh God formed man from the
dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and
man became a living soul.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Yahweh God planted a garden
eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Out of the ground Yahweh God made
every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the
tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> A river went out of Eden to water
the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> The name of the first is Pishon:
this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there
is gold;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> and the gold of
that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> The name of the second river is
Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> The name of the third river is
Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth
river is the Euphrates.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Yahweh God took the man, and put
him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Yahweh God commanded the man,
saying, &quot;Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> but of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of
it you will surely die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Yahweh God said,
&quot;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a
helper suitable for him.&quot;  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Out of the ground Yahweh God
formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought
them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called
every living creature, that was its name.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> The man gave names to all
livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field;
but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to
fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up
the flesh in its place.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> He made the rib, which Yahweh God
had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> The man said, &quot;This is now
bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because
she was taken out of Man.&quot;  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> Therefore a man will leave his
father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one
flesh.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> They were both
naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Now the serpent was
more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He
said to the woman, &quot;Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any
tree of the garden?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> The woman said to the
serpent, &quot;Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> but of the fruit of the tree which
is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it,
neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> The serpent said to the
woman, &quot;You won't surely die,  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> for God knows that in the day you
eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
and evil.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> When the woman saw that
the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and
that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit,
and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> The eyes of both of them were
opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves
together, and made themselves aprons.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> They heard the voice of Yahweh God
walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid
themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
<p> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Yahweh God called to
the man, and said to him, &quot;Where are you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> The man said, &quot;I
heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and
I hid myself.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> God said, &quot;Who
told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I
commanded you not to eat from?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> The man said,
&quot;The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and
I ate.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Yahweh God said to the
woman, &quot;What is this you have done?&quot;
<p>The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Yahweh God said to the
serpent, &quot;Because you have done this, cursed are you above all
livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall
go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> I will put enmity between you and
the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise
your head, and you will bruise his heel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> To the woman he said,
&quot;I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will
bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will
rule over you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> To Adam he said,
&quot;Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of
the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,'
cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the
days of your life.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Thorns
also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of
the field.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> By the sweat
of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of
it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> The man called his
wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Yahweh God made coats of skins
for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
<p> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> Yahweh God said,
&quot;Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil.
Now, lest he put forth his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and
eat, and live forever...&quot;  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Therefore Yahweh God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
 <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> So he drove out the man;
and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of
a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> The man knew Eve his
wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, &quot;I have gotten
a man with Yahweh's help.&quot;  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Again she gave birth, to Cain's
brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> As time passed, it
happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the
ground.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Abel also brought
some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel
and his offering,  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> but he
didn't respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the
expression on his face fell.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Yahweh said to Cain, &quot;Why are
you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> If you do well, will it not be
lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is
for you, but you are to rule over it.&quot;  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Cain said to Abel, his brother,
&quot;Let's go into the field.&quot; It happened when they were in the
field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
<p> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Yahweh said to Cain,
&quot;Where is Abel, your brother?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Yahweh said,
&quot;What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me
from the ground.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Now you
are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive
your brother's blood from your hand.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> From now on, when you till the
ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a
wanderer in the earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Cain said to Yahweh,
&quot;My punishment is greater than I can bear.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Behold, you have driven me out
this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face,
and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that
whoever finds me will kill me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Yahweh said to him,
&quot;Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him
sevenfold.&quot; Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him
should strike him.
<p> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Cain went out from
Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Cain knew his wife. She
conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name
of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> To Enoch was born Irad. Irad
became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael.
Methushael became the father of Lamech.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Lamech took two wives: the name
of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was
the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> His brother's name was Jubal, who
was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal
Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal
Cain's sister was Naamah.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> Lamech said to his wives,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
<dd>You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
<dt>for I have slain a man for wounding me,
<dd>a young man for bruising me.
<dt> <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> If Cain will be
avenged seven times,
<dd>truly Lamech seventy-seven times.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> Adam knew his wife
again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, &quot;for God has
appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&quot;
 <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> There was also born a son
to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on Yahweh's name.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> This is the book of the
generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God's
likeness.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> He created them
male and female, and blessed them, and called their name <a
href="#N2">Adam,</a> in the day when they were created.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Adam lived one hundred thirty
years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his
image, and named him Seth.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> The days of Adam after he became
the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of
sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> All
the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Seth lived one hundred
five years, and became the father of Enosh.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Seth lived after he became the
father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of sons
and daughters.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> All the
days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Enosh lived ninety
years, and became the father of Kenan.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> Enosh lived after he became the
father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of
sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> All
the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Kenan lived seventy
years, and became the father of Mahalalel.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> Kenan lived after he became the
father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of
sons and daughters  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> and
all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Mahalalel lived
sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Mahalalel lived after he became
the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of
sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> All
the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> Jared lived one
hundred sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Jared lived after he became the
father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of sons and
daughters.  <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> All the days
of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> Enoch lived sixty-five
years, and became the father of Methuselah.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Enoch walked with God after he
became the father of Methuselah three hundred years, and became the father
of sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> All the days of Enoch were three
hundred sixty-five years.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> Enoch walked with God, and he was
not, for God took him.
<p> <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Methuselah lived one
hundred eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Methuselah lived after he became
the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father
of sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> All the days of Methuselah were
nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> Lamech lived one
hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of a son,  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> and he named him Noah, saying,
&quot;This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands,
because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed.&quot;  <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> Lamech lived after he became the
father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of
sons and daughters.  <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> All
the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> Noah was five hundred
years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> It happened, when men
began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to
them,  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> that God's sons saw
that men's daughters were beautiful, and they took for themselves wives of
all that they chose.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;My Spirit will
not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; yet will his days
be one hundred twenty years.&quot;  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> The Nephilim were in the earth in
those days, and also after that, when God's sons came in to men's
daughters. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were
of old, men of renown.
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Yahweh saw that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Yahweh was sorry that he had made
man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;I will destroy
man whom I have created from the surface of the ground; man, along with
animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have
made them.&quot;  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> But Noah
found favor in Yahweh's eyes.
<p> <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> This is the history of
the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the
people of his time. Noah walked with God.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Noah became the father of three
sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> The earth was corrupt before God,
and the earth was filled with violence.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> God saw the earth, and saw that
it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
<p> <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> God said to Noah,
&quot;The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled
with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
 <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Make a ship of gopher
wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and
outside with pitch.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> This
is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred
cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> You shall make a roof in the
ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of
the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third
levels.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> I, even I, do
bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the
breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will
die.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> But I will establish
my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your
wife, and your sons' wives with you.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Of every living thing of all
flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive
with you. They shall be male and female.  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> Of the birds after their kind, of
the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground
after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
 <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Take with you of all food
that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you,
and for them.&quot;  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> Thus
Noah did. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Noah,
&quot;Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your
righteousness before me in this generation.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> You shall take seven pairs of
every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that
are not clean, take two, the male and his female.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Also of the birds of the sky,
seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all
the earth.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> In seven days,
I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of
the ground.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> Noah did everything
that Yahweh commanded him.
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Noah was six hundred
years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Noah went into the ship with his
sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, because of the waters of the flood.
 <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Clean animals, animals
that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
 <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> went by pairs to Noah into
the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> It happened after the seven days,
that the waters of the flood came on the earth.  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> In the six hundredth year of
Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on
the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the
sky's windows were opened.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> The rain was on the earth forty
days and forty nights.
<p> <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> In the same day Noah,
and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the
three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship;  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> they, and every animal after its
kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps
on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of
every sort.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> They went to
Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> Those who went in, went
in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him
in.  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> The flood was forty
days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it
was lifted up above the earth.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> The waters prevailed, and
increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the
waters.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> The waters
prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under
the whole sky were covered.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> The waters prevailed fifteen
cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> All flesh died that moved on the
earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that
creeps on the earth, and every man.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> All in whose nostrils was the
breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
 <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Every living thing was
destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock,
creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth.
Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> The waters prevailed on the earth
one hundred fifty days.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> God remembered Noah,
all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and
God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> The deep's fountains and the sky's
windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
 <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> The waters receded from
the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters
decreased.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> The ship rested
in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's
mountains.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> The waters
receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the
first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
<p> <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> It happened at the end
of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,
 <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> and he sent forth a raven.
It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
 <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> He sent forth a dove from
him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
 <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> but the dove found no
place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the
waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put forth his hand, and
took her, and brought her to him into the ship.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> He stayed yet another seven days;
and again he sent forth the dove out of the ship.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> The dove came back to him at
evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah
knew that the waters were abated from the earth.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> He stayed yet another seven days,
and sent forth the dove; and she didn't return to him any more.
<p> <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> It happened in the six
hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the
waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the
ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> In the second month, on the
twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
<p> <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> God spoke to Noah,
saying,  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> &quot;Go out of
the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with
you.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> Bring forth with you
every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds,
livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they
may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the
earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Noah went forth, with
his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> Every animal, every creeping
thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families,
went out of the ship.
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Noah built an altar to
Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and
offered burnt offerings on the altar.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Yahweh smelled the pleasant
aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, &quot;I will not again curse the ground
any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil
from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I
have done.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> While the
earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> God blessed Noah and
his sons, and said to them, &quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> The fear of you
and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every
bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish
of the sea are delivered into your hand.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Every moving thing that lives will
be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
 <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> But flesh with its life,
its blood, you shall not eat.  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> I will surely require your blood
of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand
of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life
of man.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Whoever sheds
man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own
image.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> Be fruitful and
multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> God spoke to Noah and
to his sons with him, saying,  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> &quot;As for me, behold, I
establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> and with every living creature
that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth
with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
 <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> I will establish my
covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of
the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the
earth.&quot;  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> God said,
&quot;This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you
and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
 <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> I set my rainbow in the
cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
 <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> It will happen, when I
bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> and I will remember my
covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
 <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> The rainbow will be in
the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant
between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the
earth.&quot;  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> God said to
Noah, &quot;This is the token of the covenant which I have established
between me and all flesh that is on the earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> The sons of Noah who
went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of
Canaan.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> These three were
the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
<p> <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Noah began to be a
farmer, and planted a vineyard.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> He drank of the wine and got
drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw
the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Shem and Japheth took a garment,
and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the
nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see
their father's nakedness.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> Noah awoke from his wine, and
knew what his youngest son had done to him.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> He said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Canaan is cursed.
<dt>He will be servant of servants to his brothers.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> He said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.
<dt>Let Canaan be his servant.
<dt> <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> May God enlarge
Japheth.
<dt>Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
<dt>Let Canaan be his servant.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> Noah lived three
hundred fifty years after the flood.  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> All the days of Noah were nine
hundred fifty years, then he died.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now this is the
history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and
Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
<p> <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> The sons of Japheth:
Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz,
Riphath, and Togarmah.  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> The sons of Javan: Elishah,
Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Of these were the islands of the
nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their
families, in their nations.
<p> <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> The sons of Ham: Cush,
Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Cush became the father of Nimrod.
He began to be a mighty one in the earth.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> He was a mighty hunter before
Yahweh. Therefore it is said, &quot;Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before
Yahweh.&quot;  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> The
beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land
of Shinar.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Out of that
land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
 <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> and Resen between
Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> Mizraim became the father of
Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the
Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
<p> <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Canaan became the
father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> the Jebusite, the Amorite, the
Girgashite,  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> the Hivite,
the Arkite, the Sinite,  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and
the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread
abroad.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> The border of
the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go
toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> These are the sons of Ham, after
their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> To Shem, the father
of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also
were children born.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> The
sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul,
Gether, and Mash.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Arpachshad became the father of
Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> To Eber were born two sons. The
name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His
brother's name was Joktan.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Joktan became the father of
Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All
these were the sons of Joktan.  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> Their dwelling was from Mesha,
as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> These are the sons of Shem,
after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their
nations.
<p> <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> These are the
families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations.
Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> The whole earth was of
one language and of one speech.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> It happened, as they traveled
east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
 <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> They said one to another,
&quot;Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&quot; They had
brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> They said, &quot;Come, let's
build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and
let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of
the whole earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Yahweh came down to
see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;Behold, they
are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they
begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to
do.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> Come, let's go down,
and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech.&quot;  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> So Yahweh scattered them abroad
from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the
city.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Therefore its name
was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the
earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the
earth.
<p> <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> This is the history
of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the
father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Shem lived five hundred years
after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> Arpachshad lived
thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Arpachshad lived four hundred
three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of
sons and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Shelah lived thirty
years, and became the father of Eber:  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> and Shelah lived four hundred
three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of
sons and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> Eber lived
thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> Eber lived four hundred thirty
years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Peleg lived thirty
years, and became the father of Reu.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> Peleg lived two hundred nine
years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of sons and
daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> Reu lived thirty-two
years, and became the father of Serug.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Reu lived two hundred seven
years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Serug lived thirty
years, and became the father of Nahor.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> Serug lived two hundred years
after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of sons and
daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Nahor lived
twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Nahor lived one hundred nineteen
years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p> <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Terah lived seventy
years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<p> <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> Now this is the
history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram,
Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Abram and Nahor took wives. The
name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the
daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> Sarai was barren. She had no
child.  <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> Terah took Abram
his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his
daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. They went forth from Ur of the
Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived
there.  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> The days of Terah
were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now Yahweh said to
Abram, &quot;Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from
your father's house, to the land that I will show you.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> I will make of you a great
nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
 <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> I will bless those who
bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. In you will all of the
families of the earth be blessed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> So Abram went, as
Yahweh had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years
old when he departed out of Haran.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot
his brother's son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the
souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the
land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Abram passed through the land to
the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the
land.
<p> <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> Yahweh appeared to
Abram and said, &quot;I will give this land to your <a
href="#N3">seed</a>.&quot;
<p>He built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to him.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> He left from there to the
mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the
west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on
the name of Yahweh.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> Abram
traveled, going on still toward the South.
<p> <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> There was a famine in
the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the
famine was severe in the land.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> It happened, when he had come
near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &quot;See now, I know
that you are a beautiful woman to look at.  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> It will happen, when the
Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will
kill me, but they will save you alive.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> Please say that you are my
sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may
live because of you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> It happened that when
Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very
beautiful.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> The princes
of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken
into Pharaoh's house.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> He
dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys,
male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his
house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> Pharaoh called Abram and said,
&quot;What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that
she was your wife?  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> Why
did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now
therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> Pharaoh commanded men
concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that
he had.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Abram went up out of
Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
 <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Abram was very rich in
livestock, in silver, and in gold.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> He went on his journeys from the
South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the
beginning, between Bethel and Ai,  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> to the place of the altar, which
he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.
 <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Lot also, who went with
Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> The land was not able to bear
them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so
that they could not live together.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> There was a strife between the
herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the
Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Abram said to Lot, &quot;Please,
let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and
your herdsmen; for we are relatives.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> Isn't the whole land before you?
Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will
go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the
left.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> Lot lifted up his
eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered
everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of
Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> So Lot chose the Plain of the
Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the
one from the other.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> Abram lived in the land of
Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as
far as Sodom.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Now the
men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> Yahweh said to Abram,
after Lot was separated from him, &quot;Now, lift up your eyes, and look
from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and
westward,  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> for all the
land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
 <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> I will make your
offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust
of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Arise, walk through the land in
its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Abram moved his tent,
and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an
altar there to Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> It happened in the
days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer,
king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> that they made war with Bera,
king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah,
and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
 <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> All these joined together
in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> Twelve years they served
Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> In the fourteenth year
Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim
in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh
Kiriathaim,  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> and the
Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
 <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> They returned, and came
to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the
Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> The king of Sodom, and the king
of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king
of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array
against them in the valley of Siddim;  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> against Chedorlaomer king of
Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch
king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Now the valley of Siddim was
full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell
there, and those who remained fled to the hills.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> They took all the goods of Sodom
and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> They took Lot, Abram's brother's
son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
<p> <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> One who had escaped
came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the
Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of
Abram.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> When Abram heard
that his relative was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in
his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> He divided himself against them
by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah,
which is on the left hand of Damascus.  <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> He brought back all the goods,
and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women
also, and the people.
<p> <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> The king of Sodom
went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer
and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the
King's Valley).  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> He blessed him, and said,
&quot;Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
 <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> and blessed be God Most
High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.&quot;
<p>Abram gave him a tenth of all.
<p> <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> The king of Sodom
said to Abram, &quot;Give me the people, and take the goods to
yourself.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Abram said to the
king of Sodom, &quot;I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High,
possessor of heaven and earth,  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> that I will not take a thread
nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I
have made Abram rich.'  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> I
will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten,
and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let
them take their portion.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> After these things the
word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, &quot;Don't be afraid,
Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Abram said, &quot;Lord
Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and he who will
inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?&quot;  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> Abram said, &quot;Behold, to me
you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Behold, the word of
Yahweh came to him, saying, &quot;This man will not be your heir, but he
who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir.&quot;  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> Yahweh brought him outside, and
said, &quot;Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able
to count them.&quot; He said to Abram, &quot;So shall your seed be.&quot;
 <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> He believed in Yahweh;
and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> He said to him, &quot;I am Yahweh
who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to
inherit it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> He said, &quot;Lord
Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a
ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&quot;  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> He brought him all of these, and
divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he
didn't divide the birds.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> The birds of prey came down on
the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
<p> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> When the sun was
going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell
on him.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> He said to
Abram, &quot;Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a
land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four
hundred years.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> I will
also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out
with great wealth,  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> but
you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old
age.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> In the fourth
generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is
not yet full.&quot;  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> It
came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a
smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> In that day Yahweh made a
covenant with Abram, saying, &quot;To your seed I have given this land,
from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the
Kadmonites,  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> the
Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> the Amorites, the Canaanites,
the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Now Sarai, Abram's
wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name
was Hagar.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> Sarai said to
Abram, &quot;See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in
to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by her.&quot; Abram
listened to the voice of Sarai.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar
the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of
Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> He went in to Hagar, and she
conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised
in her eyes.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> Sarai said
to Abram, &quot;This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your
bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her
eyes. Yahweh judge between me and you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> But Abram said to
Sarai, &quot;Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good
in your eyes.&quot; Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her
face.
<p> <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the
way to Shur.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> He said,
&quot;Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you
going?&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
said to her, &quot;Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her
hands.&quot;  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> The angel
of Yahweh said to her, &quot;I will greatly multiply your seed, that they
will not be numbered for multitude.&quot;  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> The angel of Yahweh said to her,
&quot;Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his
name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> He will be like a wild donkey
among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand
against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> She called the name
of Yahweh who spoke to her, &quot;You are a God who sees,&quot; for she
said, &quot;Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?&quot;  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Therefore the well was called <a
href="#N4">Beer Lahai Roi.</a> Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
<p> <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> Hagar bore a son for
Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> Abram was eighty-six years old
when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> When Abram was
ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said to him, &quot;I
am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> I will make my covenant between
me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> Abram fell on his
face. God talked with him, saying,  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> &quot;As for me, behold, my
covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.
 <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> Neither will your name
any more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made
you the father of a multitude of nations.  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> I will make you exceedingly
fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.
 <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> I will establish my
covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their
generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your
seed after you.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> I will
give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling,
all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their
God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> God said to Abraham,
&quot;As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you
throughout their generations.  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> This is my covenant, which you
shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among
you shall be circumcised.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> You shall be circumcised in the
flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and
you.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> He who is eight
days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your
generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any
foreigner who is not of your seed.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> He who is born in your house,
and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant
will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> The uncircumcised male who is
not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off
from his people. He has broken my covenant.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> God said to Abraham,
&quot;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her
name will be Sarah.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> I
will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will
bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come
from her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Then Abraham fell on
his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, &quot;Will a child be born
to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old,
give birth?&quot;  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> Abraham said to God, &quot;Oh
that Ishmael might live before you!&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> God said, &quot;No,
but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name <a
href="#N5">Isaac.</a> I will establish my covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant for his seed after him.  <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> As for Ishmael, I have heard
you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will
multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and
I will make him a great nation.  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> But my covenant I establish with
Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> When he finished
talking with him, God went up from Abraham.  <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> Abraham took Ishmael his son,
all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money;
every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of
their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> Abraham was ninety-nine years
old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> Ishmael, his son, was thirteen
years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> In the same day both Abraham and
Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> All the men of his house, those
born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were
circumcised with him.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> Yahweh appeared to him
by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
 <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> He lifted up his eyes and
looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
 <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> and said, &quot;My lord,
if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your
servant.  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> Now let a little
water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
 <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> I will get a morsel of
bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now
that you have come to your servant.&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Very well, do as you have said.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> Abraham hurried into
the tent to Sarah, and said, &quot;Quickly make ready three measures of
fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.&quot;  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> Abraham ran to the herd, and
fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to
dress it.  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> He took butter,
milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood
by them under the tree, and they ate.
<p> <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Where is Sarah, your wife?
<p>He said, &quot;See, in the tent.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> He said, &quot;I will
certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your
wife will have a son.&quot;
<p>Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> Now Abraham and Sarah were old,
well advanced in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of
women.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> Sarah laughed
within herself, saying, &quot;After I have grown old will I have pleasure,
my lord being old also?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> Yahweh said to
Abraham, &quot;Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child,
yet I am old?'  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Is
anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when
the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> Then Sarah denied,
saying, &quot;I didn't laugh,&quot; for she was afraid.
<p>He said, &quot;No, but you did laugh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> The men rose up from
there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on
their way.  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> Yahweh said,
&quot;Will I hide from Abraham what I do,  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> seeing that Abraham has surely
become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be
blessed in him?  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> For I
have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his
household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do
righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham
that which he has spoken of him.&quot;  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;Because the
cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very
grievous,  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> I will go down
now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come
to me. If not, I will know.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> The men turned from
there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Abraham drew near, and said,
&quot;Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> What if there are fifty
righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for
the fifty righteous who are in it?  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Be it far from you to do things
like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous
should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge
of all the earth do right?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> Yahweh said, &quot;If
I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the
place for their sake.&quot;  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> Abraham answered, &quot;See now,
I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.
 <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> What if there will lack
five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of
five?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> He spoke to him yet
again, and said, &quot;What if there are forty found there?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will not do it for the forty's sake.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> He said, &quot;Oh
don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty
found there?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will not do it, if I find thirty there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> He said, &quot;See
now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are
twenty found there?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> He said, &quot;Oh
don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten
are found there?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> Yahweh went his way,
as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to
his place.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> The two angels came to
Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up
to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> and he said, &quot;See now, my
lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash
your feet, and you will rise up early, and go on your way.&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;No, but we will stay in the street all night.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> He urged them greatly,
and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a
feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> But before they lay down, the men
of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old,
all the people from every quarter.  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> They called to Lot, and said to
him, &quot;Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out
to us, that we may have sex with them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> Lot went out to them
to the door, and shut the door after him.  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> He said, &quot;Please, my
brothers, don't act so wickedly.  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> See now, I have two virgin
daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them
what seems good to you. Only don't do anything to these men, because they
have come under the shadow of my roof.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> They said, &quot;Stand
back!&quot; They said, &quot;This one fellow came in to live as a
foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with
you, than with them!&quot; They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near
to break the door.  <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> But
the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and
shut the door.  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> They
struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both
small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
<p> <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> The men said to Lot,
&quot;Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your
daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:
 <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> for we will destroy this
place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that
Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> Lot went out, and
spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and
said, &quot;Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the
city.&quot;
<p>But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> When the morning came, then the
angels hurried Lot, saying, &quot;Get up! Take your wife, and your two
daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the
city.&quot;  <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> But he
lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two
daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and
set him outside of the city.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> It came to pass, when they had
taken them out, that he said, &quot;Escape for your life! Don't look
behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains,
lest you be consumed!&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> Lot said to them,
&quot;Oh, not so, my lord.  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> See now, your servant has found
favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which
you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain,
lest evil overtake me, and I die.  <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> See now, this city is near to
flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little
one?), and my soul will live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that
I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> Hurry, escape there, for I can't
do anything until you get there.&quot; Therefore the name of the city was
called <a href="#N6">Zoar.</a>
<p> <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> The sun had risen on
the earth when Lot came to Zoar.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and
on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> He overthrew those cities, all
the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the
ground.  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> But his wife
looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
<p> <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> Abraham got up early
in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.  <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> He looked toward Sodom and
Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that
the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
<p> <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> It happened, when God
destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent
Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in
which Lot lived.
<p> <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> Lot went up out of
Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he
was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
 <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> The firstborn said to
the younger, &quot;Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth
to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.  <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> Come, let's make our father
drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's
seed.&quot;  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> They made
their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay
with her father. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
 <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> It came to pass on the
next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, &quot;Behold, I lay last
night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go
in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed.&quot;
 <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> They made their father
drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn't
know when she lay down, nor when she got up.  <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> Thus both of Lot's daughters
were with child by their father.  <a name="C19V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:37</font></a> The firstborn bore a son, and
named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.  <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> The younger also bore a son, and
called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to
this day.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Abraham traveled from
there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He
lived as a foreigner in Gerar.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> Abraham said about Sarah his
wife, &quot;She is my sister.&quot; Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took
Sarah.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> But God came to
Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, &quot;Behold, you are
a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's
wife.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> Now Abimelech had not
come near her. He said, &quot;Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?
 <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Didn't he tell me, 'She
is my sister?' She, even she herself, said, 'He is my brother.' In the
integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> God said to him in the
dream, &quot;Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done
this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't
allow you to touch her.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> Now therefore, restore the man's
wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If
you don't restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who
are yours.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> Abimelech rose early
in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in
their ear. The men were very scared.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> Then Abimelech called Abraham,
and said to him, &quot;What have you done to us? How have I sinned against
you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have
done deeds to me that ought not to be done!&quot;  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> Abimelech said to Abraham,
&quot;What did you see, that you have done this thing?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> Abraham said,
&quot;Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place.
They will kill me for my wife's sake.'  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> Besides, she is indeed my
sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and
she became my wife.  <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> It
happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said
to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that
we go, say of me, &quot;He is my brother.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Abimelech took sheep
and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham,
and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Abimelech said, &quot;Behold, my
land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.&quot;  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> To Sarah he said, &quot;Behold,
I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for
you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you
are vindicated.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> Abraham prayed to
God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they
bore children.  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> For
Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,
because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> Yahweh visited Sarah
as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham
a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
 <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> Abraham called his son
who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, <a href="#N7">Isaac.</a>
 <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> Abraham circumcised his
son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> Abraham was one hundred years old
when his son, Isaac, was born to him.  <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> Sarah said, &quot;God has made me
laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.&quot;  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> She said, &quot;Who would have
said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a
son in his old age.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> The child grew, and
was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
 <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> Sarah saw the son of
Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> Therefore she said to Abraham,
&quot;Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid
will not be heir with my son, Isaac.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> The thing was very
grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> God said to Abraham, &quot;Don't
let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your
handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from
Isaac will your seed be called.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> I will also make a nation of the
son of the handmaid, because he is your seed.&quot;  <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> Abraham rose up early in the
morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar,
putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> The water in the bottle was
spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> She went and sat down opposite
him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, &quot;Don't let
me see the death of the child.&quot; She sat over against him, and lifted
up her voice, and wept.  <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> God heard the voice of the boy.
<p>The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her,
&quot;What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice
of the boy where he is.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> Get up, lift up the boy, and
hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> God opened her eyes,
and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and
gave the boy drink.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> God
was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as
he grew up, an archer.  <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> He lived in the wilderness of
Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> It happened at that
time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham,
saying, &quot;God is with you in all that you do.  <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> Now, therefore, swear to me here
by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with
my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you
shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a
foreigner.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> Abraham said, &quot;I
will swear.&quot;  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> Abraham complained to Abimelech
because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken
away.  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> Abimelech said,
&quot;I don't know who has done this thing. Neither did you tell me,
neither did I hear of it, until today.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> Abraham took sheep
and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.  <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> Abraham set seven ewe lambs of
the flock by themselves.  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> Abimelech said to Abraham,
&quot;What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves
mean?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> He said, &quot;You
shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to
me, that I have dug this well.&quot;  <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> Therefore he called that place
<a href="#N8">Beersheba,</a> because they both swore there.  <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> So they made a covenant at
Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and
they returned into the land of the Philistines.  <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> Abraham planted a tamarisk tree
in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
 <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> Abraham lived as a
foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> It happened after
these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him,
&quot;Abraham!&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> He said, &quot;Now
take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the
land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the
mountains which I will tell you of.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> Abraham rose early in
the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with
him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose
up, and went to the place of which God had told him.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> On the third day Abraham lifted
up his eyes, and saw the place far off.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> Abraham said to his young men,
&quot;Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will
worship, and come back to you.&quot;  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> Abraham took the wood of the
burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire
and the knife. They both went together.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> Isaac spoke to Abraham his
father, and said, &quot;My father?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am, my son.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for
a burnt offering?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> Abraham said,
&quot;God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my
son.&quot; So they both went together.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> They came to the place which God
had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in
order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
 <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Abraham stretched forth
his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
<p> <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
called to him out of the sky, and said, &quot;Abraham, Abraham!&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> He said, &quot;Don't
lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that
you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> Abraham lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket
by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a
burnt offering instead of his son.  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> Abraham called the name of that
place <a href="#N9">Yahweh Will Provide</a>. As it is said to this day,
&quot;On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> The angel of Yahweh
called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> and said, &quot;I have sworn by
myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not
withheld your son, your only son,  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> that I will bless you greatly,
and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and
like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of
his enemies.  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> In your
seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed
my voice.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> So Abraham returned
to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham
lived at Beersheba.
<p> <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> It happened after
these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, &quot;Behold, Milcah, she
also has borne children to your brother Nahor:  <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> Uz his firstborn, Buz his
brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph,
and Bethuel.&quot;  <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> Bethuel became the father of
Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> His concubine, whose name was
Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Sarah lived one
hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah's life.  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the
same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah,
and to weep for her.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> Abraham rose up from before his
dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> &quot;I am a stranger and a
foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with
you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> The children of Heth
answered Abraham, saying to him,  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> &quot;Hear us, my lord. You are a
prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of
us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> Abraham rose up, and
bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
 <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> He talked with them,
saying, &quot;If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my
sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> that he may give me the cave of
Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full
price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a
burying-place.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> Now Ephron was
sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered
Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at
the gate of his city, saying,  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> &quot;No, my lord, hear me. I
give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence
of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> Abraham bowed himself
down before the people of the land.  <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> He spoke to Ephron in the
audience of the people of the land, saying, &quot;But if you will, please
hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will
bury my dead there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> Ephron answered
Abraham, saying to him,  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> &quot;My lord, listen to me.
What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me
and you? Therefore bury your dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> Abraham listened to
Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the
audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver,
according to the current merchants' standard.
<p> <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> So the field of
Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the
cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were
in all of its borders, were deeded  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> to Abraham for a possession in
the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate
of his city.  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> After this,
Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before
Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> The field, and the cave that is
in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the
children of Heth.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Abraham was old, and
well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> Abraham said to his servant, the
elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, &quot;Please put your
hand under my thigh.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> I
will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth,
that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the
Canaanites, among whom I live.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> But you shall go to my country,
and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> The servant said to
him, &quot;What if the woman isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must
I bring your son again to the land you came from?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> Abraham said to him,
&quot;Beware that you don't bring my son there again.  <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> Yahweh, the God of heaven, who
took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke
to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your <a
href="#N10">seed</a>.' He will send his angel before you, and you shall
take a wife for my son from there.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> If the woman isn't willing to
follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not
bring my son there again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> The servant put his
hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning
this matter.  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> The servant
took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed, having a variety of
good things of his master's with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia,
to the city of Nahor.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> He
made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the
time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> He said, &quot;Yahweh, the God
of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness
to my master Abraham.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> Behold, I am standing by the
spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to
draw water.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> Let it
happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, 'Please let down your
pitcher, that I may drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also give
your camels a drink,'--let her be the one you have appointed for your
servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my
master.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> It happened, before
he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to
Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her
pitcher on her shoulder.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> The young lady was very
beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went
down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> The servant ran to meet her, and
said, &quot;Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> She said,
&quot;Drink, my lord.&quot; She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her
hand, and gave him drink.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> When she had done giving him
drink, she said, &quot;I will also draw for your camels, until they have
done drinking.&quot;  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> She
hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the
well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
<p> <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> The man looked
steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his
journey prosperous or not.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> It happened, as the camels had
done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight,
and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> and said, &quot;Whose daughter
are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to
lodge in?&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> She said to him,
&quot;I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to
Nahor.&quot;  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> She said
moreover to him, &quot;We have both straw and provender enough, and room
to lodge in.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> The man bowed his
head, and worshiped Yahweh.  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> He said, &quot;Blessed be
Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving
kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in
the way to the house of my master's relatives.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:28</font></a> The young lady ran,
and told her mother's house about these words.  <a name="C24V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:29</font></a> Rebekah had a brother, and his
name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.  <a name="C24V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:30</font></a> It happened, when he saw the
ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words
of Rebekah his sister, saying, &quot;This is what the man said to
me,&quot; that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels
at the spring.  <a name="C24V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:31</font></a> He said,
&quot;Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have
prepared the house, and room for the camels.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:32</font></a> The man came into the
house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the
camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with
him.  <a name="C24V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:33</font></a> Food was set before
him to eat, but he said, &quot;I will not eat until I have told my
message.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Speak on.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:34</font></a> He said, &quot;I am
Abraham's servant.  <a name="C24V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:35</font></a> Yahweh has blessed my master
greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver
and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
 <a name="C24V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:36</font></a> Sarah, my master's wife,
bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to
him.  <a name="C24V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:37</font></a> My master made me
swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of
the Canaanites, in whose land I live,  <a name="C24V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:38</font></a> but you shall go to my father's
house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'  <a name="C24V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:39</font></a> I said to my master, 'What if
the woman will not follow me?'  <a name="C24V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:40</font></a> He said to me, 'Yahweh, before
whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall
take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father's house.  <a name="C24V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:41</font></a> Then will you be clear from my
oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don't give her to you, you
shall be clear from my oath.'  <a name="C24V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:42</font></a> I came this day to the spring,
and said, 'Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my
way which I go-- <a name="C24V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:43</font></a> behold,
I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who
comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, &quot;Give me, I pray you, a
little water from your pitcher to drink,&quot;  <a name="C24V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:44</font></a> and she will tell me,
&quot;Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,&quot;--let her be the
woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master's son.'  <a name="C24V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:45</font></a> Before I had done speaking in my
heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. She
went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
 <a name="C24V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:46</font></a> She hurried and let down
her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your
camels a drink.' So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  <a name="C24V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:47</font></a> I asked her, and said, 'Whose
daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom
Milcah bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her
hands.  <a name="C24V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:48</font></a> I bowed my head,
and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham,
who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for
his son.  <a name="C24V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:49</font></a> Now if you will
deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may
turn to the right hand, or to the left.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:50</font></a> Then Laban and
Bethuel answered, &quot;The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to
you bad or good.  <a name="C24V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:51</font></a> Behold,
Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master's
son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:52</font></a> It happened that when
Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to
Yahweh.  <a name="C24V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:53</font></a> The servant
brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave
them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her
mother.  <a name="C24V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:54</font></a> They ate and
drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose
up in the morning, and he said, &quot;Send me away to my master.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:55</font></a> Her brother and her
mother said, &quot;Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least
ten. After that she will go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:56</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away
that I may go to my master.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:57</font></a> They said, &quot;We
will call the young lady, and ask her.&quot;  <a name="C24V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:58</font></a> They called Rebekah, and said to
her, &quot;Will you go with this man?&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;I will go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:59</font></a> They sent away
Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men.
 <a name="C24V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:60</font></a> They blessed Rebekah,
and said to her, &quot;Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of
ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate
them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C24V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:61</font></a> Rebekah arose with
her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant
took Rebekah, and went his way.  <a name="C24V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:62</font></a> Isaac came from the way of Beer
Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.  <a name="C24V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:63</font></a> Isaac went out to meditate in
the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold,
there were camels coming.  <a name="C24V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:64</font></a> Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and
when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.  <a name="C24V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:65</font></a> She said to the servant,
&quot;Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?&quot;
<p>The servant said, &quot;It is my master.&quot;
<p>She took her veil, and covered herself.  <a name="C24V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:66</font></a> The servant told Isaac all the
things that he had done.  <a name="C24V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:67</font></a> Isaac brought her into his
mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved
her. Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> Abraham took another
wife, and her name was Keturah.  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> She bore him Zimran, Jokshan,
Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Jokshan became the father of
Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
 <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> The sons of Midian:
Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of
Keturah.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> Abraham gave all
that he had to Isaac,  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> but
to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away
from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
 <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> These are the days of the
years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
 <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> Abraham gave up the
spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was
gathered to his people.  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> Isaac and Ishmael, his sons,
buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of
Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> the field which Abraham
purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah,
his wife.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> It happened
after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by
Beer Lahai Roi.
<p> <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> Now this is the
history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the
Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> These are the names of the sons
of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the
firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedemah.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> These are the
sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by
their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.  <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> These are the years of the life
of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and
died, and was gathered to his people.  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> They lived from Havilah to Shur
that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his
relatives.
<p> <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> This is the history
of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of
Isaac.  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> Isaac was forty
years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of
Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.  <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> Isaac entreated Yahweh for his
wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his
wife conceived.  <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> The
children struggled together within her. She said, &quot;If it be so, why
do I live?&quot; She went to inquire of Yahweh.  <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> Yahweh said to her,
<dl>
<dt>Two nations are in your womb.
<dt>Two peoples will be separated from your body.
<dt>The one people will be stronger than the other people.
<dt>The elder will serve the younger.
</dl>
<p> <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> When her days to be
delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> The first came out red all over,
like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.  <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> After that, his brother came
out, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was
sixty years old when she bore them.
<p> <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> The boys grew. Esau
was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living
in tents.  <a name="C25V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:28</font></a> Now Isaac
loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.  <a name="C25V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:29</font></a> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in
from the field, and he was famished.  <a name="C25V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:30</font></a> Esau said to Jacob, &quot;Please
feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.&quot; Therefore his
name was called Edom.
<p> <a name="C25V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:31</font></a> Jacob said,
&quot;First, sell me your birthright.&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:32</font></a> Esau said,
&quot;Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C25V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:33</font></a> Jacob said,
&quot;Swear to me first.&quot;
<p>He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.  <a name="C25V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:34</font></a> Jacob gave Esau bread and stew
of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised
his birthright.
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> There was a famine in
the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac
went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> Yahweh appeared to him, and said,
&quot;Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.
 <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> Sojourn in this land, and
I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I
will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to
Abraham your father.  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> I
will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your
seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be
blessed,  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> because Abraham
obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes,
and my laws.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> Isaac lived in Gerar.
 <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> The men of the place
asked him about his wife. He said, &quot;She is my sister,&quot; for he
was afraid to say, &quot;My wife,&quot; lest, he thought, &quot;the men of
the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look
at.&quot;  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> It happened,
when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines
looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah,
his wife.  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> Abimelech
called Isaac, and said, &quot;Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you
say, 'She is my sister?'&quot;
<p>Isaac said to him, &quot;Because I said, 'Lest I die because of
her.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> Abimelech said,
&quot;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily
have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> Abimelech commanded
all the people, saying, &quot;He who touches this man or his wife will
surely be put to death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> Isaac sowed in that
land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted.
Yahweh blessed him.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> The
man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.  <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> He had possessions of flocks,
possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.
 <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> Now all the wells which
his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the
Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> Abimelech said to Isaac,
&quot;Go from us, for you are much mightier than we.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> Isaac departed from
there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
<p> <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> Isaac dug again the
wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For
the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called
their names after the names by which his father had called them.  <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> Isaac's servants dug in the
valley, and found there a well of springing water.  <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> The herdsmen of Gerar argued
with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, &quot;The water is ours.&quot; He called
the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> They dug another well, and they
argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.  <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> He left that place, and dug
another well. They didn't argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He
said, &quot;For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful
in the land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> He went up from there
to Beersheba.  <a name="C26V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:24</font></a> Yahweh
appeared to him the same night, and said, &quot;I am the God of Abraham
your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and
multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:25</font></a> He built an altar
there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. There
Isaac's servants dug a well.
<p> <a name="C26V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:26</font></a> Then Abimelech went
to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his
army.  <a name="C26V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:27</font></a> Isaac said to
them, &quot;Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me
away from you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:28</font></a> They said, &quot;We
saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath
between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,
 <a name="C26V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:29</font></a> that you will do us no
harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but
good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of
Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:30</font></a> He made them a feast,
and they ate and drank.  <a name="C26V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:31</font></a> They rose up some time in the
morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed
from him in peace.  <a name="C26V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:32</font></a> It
happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning
the well which they had dug, and said to him, &quot;We have found
water.&quot;  <a name="C26V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:33</font></a> He called
it <a href="#N11">Shibah.</a> Therefore the name of the city is <a
href="#N12">Beersheba</a> to this day.
<p> <a name="C26V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:34</font></a> When Esau was forty
years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.  <a name="C26V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:35</font></a> They grieved Isaac's and
Rebekah's spirits.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> It happened, that when
Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called
Esau his elder son, and said to him, &quot;My son?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> He said, &quot;See
now, I am old. I don't know the day of my death.  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> Now therefore, please take your
weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me
venison.  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> Make me savory
food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul
may bless you before I die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> Rebekah heard when
Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison,
and to bring it.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> Rebekah
spoke to Jacob her son, saying, &quot;Behold, I heard your father speak to
Esau your brother, saying,  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> 'Bring me venison, and make me
savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'
 <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> Now therefore, my son,
obey my voice according to that which I command you.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> Go now to the flock, and get me
from there two good kids of the goats. I will make them savory food for
your father, such as he loves.  <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> You shall bring it to your
father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> Jacob said to Rebekah
his mother, &quot;Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a
smooth man.  <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> What if my
father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a
curse on myself, and not a blessing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> His mother said to
him, &quot;Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get
them for me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> He went, and got
them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as
his father loved.  <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> Rebekah took the good clothes of
Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on
Jacob, her younger son.  <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> She put the skins of the kids of
the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> She gave the savory food and the
bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
<p> <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> He came to his
father, and said, &quot;My father?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> Jacob said to his
father, &quot;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to
do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> Isaac said to his
son, &quot;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Because Yahweh your God gave me success.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> Isaac said to Jacob,
&quot;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are
really my son Esau or not.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> Jacob went near to
Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, &quot;The voice is Jacob's voice,
but the hands are the hands of Esau.&quot;  <a name="C27V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:23</font></a> He didn't recognize him, because
his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
 <a name="C27V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:24</font></a> He said, &quot;Are you
really my son Esau?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:25</font></a> He said, &quot;Bring
it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless
you.&quot;
<p>He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he
drank.  <a name="C27V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:26</font></a> His father Isaac
said to him, &quot;Come near now, and kiss me, my son.&quot;  <a name="C27V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:27</font></a> He came near, and kissed him. He
smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Behold, the smell of my son
<dd>is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.
<dt> <a name="C27V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:28</font></a> God give you of the
dew of the sky,
<dd>of the fatness of the earth,
<dd>and plenty of grain and new wine.
<dt> <a name="C27V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:29</font></a> Let peoples serve
you,
<dd>and nations bow down to you.
<dt>Be lord over your brothers.
<dd>Let your mother's sons bow down to you.
<dt>Cursed be everyone who curses you.
<dd>Blessed be everyone who blesses you.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C27V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:30</font></a> It happened, as soon
as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out
from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from
his hunting.  <a name="C27V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:31</font></a> He also
made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father,
&quot;Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul
may bless me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:32</font></a> Isaac his father said
to him, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:33</font></a> Isaac trembled
violently, and said, &quot;Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed
him? Yes, he will be blessed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:34</font></a> When Esau heard the
words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and
said to his father, &quot;Bless me, even me also, my father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:35</font></a> He said, &quot;Your
brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:36</font></a> He said, &quot;Isn't
he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took
away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.&quot; He said,
&quot;Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:37</font></a> Isaac answered Esau,
&quot;Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given
to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What
then will I do for you, my son?&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:38</font></a> Esau said to his
father, &quot;Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me
also, my father.&quot; Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
<p> <a name="C27V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:39</font></a> Isaac his father
answered him,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling,
<dt>and of the dew of the sky from above.
<dt> <a name="C27V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:40</font></a> By your sword will
you live, and you will serve your brother.
<dt>It will happen, when you will break loose,
<dt>that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C27V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:41</font></a> Esau hated Jacob
because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in
his heart, &quot;The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I
will kill my brother Jacob.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:42</font></a> The words of Esau,
her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her
younger son, and said to him, &quot;Behold, your brother Esau comforts
himself about you by planning to kill you.  <a name="C27V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:43</font></a> Now therefore, my son, obey my
voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.  <a name="C27V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:44</font></a> Stay with him a few days, until
your brother's fury turns away;  <a name="C27V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:45</font></a> until your brother's anger turn
away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send,
and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one
day?&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:46</font></a> Rebekah said to
Isaac, &quot;I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If
Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the
daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> Isaac called Jacob,
blessed him, and commanded him, &quot;You shall not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan.  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the
house of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from there from the
daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> May God Almighty bless you, and
make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,
 <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> and give you the blessing
of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the
land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> Isaac sent Jacob away.
He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's
brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
<p> <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> Now Esau saw that
Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a
wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying,
&quot;You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,&quot;  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> and that Jacob obeyed his father
and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.  <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> Esau saw that the daughters of
Canaan didn't please Isaac, his father.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> Esau went to Ishmael, and took,
besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's
son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
<p> <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> Jacob went out from
Beersheba, and went toward Haran.  <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> He came to a certain place, and
stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones
of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to
sleep.  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> He dreamed.
Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven.
Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> Behold, Yahweh stood above it,
and said, &quot;I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God
of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your
seed.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> Your seed will be
as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to
the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will
all the families of the earth be blessed.  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> Behold, I am with you, and will
keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I
will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> Jacob awakened out of
his sleep, and he said, &quot;Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn't
know it.&quot;  <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> He was
afraid, and said, &quot;How dreadful is this place! This is none other
than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> Jacob rose up early
in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set
it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> He called the name of that place
Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> Jacob vowed a vow, saying,
&quot;If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and
will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,  <a name="C28V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:21</font></a> so that I come again to my
father's house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,  <a name="C28V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:22</font></a> then this stone, which I have
set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I
will surely give the tenth to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:1</font></a> Then Jacob went on his
journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.  <a name="C29V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:2</font></a> He looked, and behold, a well in
the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out
of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was
large.  <a name="C29V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:3</font></a> There all the
flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and
watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its
place.  <a name="C29V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:4</font></a> Jacob said to
them, &quot;My relatives, where are you from?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;We are from Haran.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:5</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;We know him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:6</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Is it well with him?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with
the sheep.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:7</font></a> He said, &quot;Behold,
it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock
together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:8</font></a> They said, &quot;We
can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone
from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:9</font></a> While he was yet
speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept
them.  <a name="C29V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:10</font></a> It happened, when
Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the
sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's
brother.  <a name="C29V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:11</font></a> Jacob kissed
Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  <a name="C29V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:12</font></a> Jacob told Rachel that he was
her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her
father.
<p> <a name="C29V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:13</font></a> It happened, when
Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet
Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.
Jacob told Laban all these things.  <a name="C29V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:14</font></a> Laban said to him, Surely you
are my bone and my flesh. He lived with him for a month.  <a name="C29V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:15</font></a> Laban said to Jacob,
&quot;Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for
nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:16</font></a> Laban had two
daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was
Rachel.  <a name="C29V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:17</font></a> Leah's eyes were
weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.  <a name="C29V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:18</font></a> Jacob loved Rachel. He said,
&quot;I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:19</font></a> Laban said, &quot;It
is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another
man. Stay with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:20</font></a> Jacob served seven
years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had
for her.
<p> <a name="C29V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:21</font></a> Jacob said to Laban,
&quot;Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to
her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:22</font></a> Laban gathered
together all the men of the place, and made a feast.  <a name="C29V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:23</font></a> It happened in the evening, that
he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.
 <a name="C29V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:24</font></a> Laban gave Zilpah his
handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.  <a name="C29V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:25</font></a> It happened in the morning that,
behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, &quot;What is this you have done to
me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived
me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:26</font></a> Laban said, &quot;It
is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
 <a name="C29V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:27</font></a> Fulfill the week of this
one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will
serve with me yet seven other years.&quot;
<p> <a name="C29V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:28</font></a> Jacob did so, and
fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.  <a name="C29V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:29</font></a> Laban gave to Rachel his
daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid.  <a name="C29V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:30</font></a> He went in also to Rachel, and
he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other
years.
<p> <a name="C29V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:31</font></a> Yahweh saw that Leah
was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.  <a name="C29V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:32</font></a> Leah conceived, and bore a son,
and she named him Reuben. For she said, &quot;Because Yahweh has looked at
my affliction. For now my husband will love me.&quot;  <a name="C29V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:33</font></a> She conceived again, and bore a
son, and said, &quot;Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has
therefore given me this son also.&quot; She named him Simeon.  <a name="C29V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:34</font></a> She conceived again, and bore a
son. Said, &quot;Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I
have borne him three sons.&quot; Therefore was his name called Levi.
 <a name="C29V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">29:35</font></a> She conceived again, and
bore a son. She said, &quot;This time will I praise Yahweh.&quot;
Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
<p> <a name="C30V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:1</font></a> When Rachel saw that
she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob,
&quot;Give me children, or else I will die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:2</font></a> Jacob's anger was
kindled against Rachel, and he said, &quot;Am I in God's place, who has
withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:3</font></a> She said,
&quot;Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees,
and I also may obtain children by her.&quot;  <a name="C30V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:4</font></a> She gave him Bilhah her handmaid
as wife, and Jacob went in to her.  <a name="C30V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:5</font></a> Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob
a son.  <a name="C30V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:6</font></a> Rachel said,
&quot;God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a
son.&quot; Therefore called she his name Dan.  <a name="C30V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:7</font></a> Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid,
conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.  <a name="C30V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:8</font></a> Rachel said, &quot;With mighty
wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.&quot; She
named him Naphtali.
<p> <a name="C30V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:9</font></a> When Leah saw that she
had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob
as a wife.  <a name="C30V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:10</font></a> Zilpah,
Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son.  <a name="C30V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:11</font></a> Leah said, &quot;How
fortunate!&quot; She named him Gad.  <a name="C30V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:12</font></a> Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore
Jacob a second son.  <a name="C30V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:13</font></a> Leah
said, &quot;Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.&quot; She
named him Asher.
<p> <a name="C30V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:14</font></a> Reuben went in the
days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them
to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, &quot;Please give me some
of your son's mandrakes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:15</font></a> She said to her,
&quot;Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you
take away my son's mandrakes, also?&quot;
<p>Rachel said, &quot;Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your
son's mandrakes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:16</font></a> Jacob came from the
field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, &quot;You
must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's
mandrakes.&quot;
<p>He lay with her that night.  <a name="C30V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:17</font></a> God listened to Leah, and she
conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.  <a name="C30V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:18</font></a> Leah said, &quot;God has given
me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband.&quot; She named him
Issachar.  <a name="C30V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:19</font></a> Leah conceived
again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.  <a name="C30V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:20</font></a> Leah said, &quot;God has endowed
me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have
borne him six sons.&quot; She named him Zebulun.  <a name="C30V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:21</font></a> Afterwards, she bore a daughter,
and named her Dinah.
<p> <a name="C30V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:22</font></a> God remembered
Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.  <a name="C30V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:23</font></a> She conceived, bore a son, and
said, &quot;God has taken away my reproach.&quot;  <a name="C30V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:24</font></a> She named him <a
href="#N13">Joseph,</a> saying, &quot;May Yahweh add another son to
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:25</font></a> It happened, when
Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, &quot;Send me away,
that I may go to my own place, and to my country.  <a name="C30V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:26</font></a> Give me my wives and my children
for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with
which I have served you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:27</font></a> Laban said to him,
&quot;If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have
divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.&quot;  <a name="C30V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:28</font></a> He said, &quot;Appoint me your
wages, and I will give it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:29</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared
with me.  <a name="C30V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:30</font></a> For it was
little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude.
Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my
own house also?&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:31</font></a> He said, &quot;What
shall I give you?&quot;
<p>Jacob said, &quot;You shall not give me anything. If you will do this
thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.  <a name="C30V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:32</font></a> I will pass through all your
flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every
black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.
This will be my hire.  <a name="C30V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:33</font></a> So
my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my
hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among
the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be
counted stolen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:34</font></a> Laban said,
&quot;Behold, I desire it to be according to your word.&quot;
<p> <a name="C30V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:35</font></a> That day, he removed
the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats
that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all
the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
 <a name="C30V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:36</font></a> He set three days'
journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's
flocks.
<p> <a name="C30V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:37</font></a> Jacob took to himself
rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them,
and made the white appear which was in the rods.  <a name="C30V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:38</font></a> He set the rods which he had
peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where
the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.  <a name="C30V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:39</font></a> The flocks conceived before the
rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.
 <a name="C30V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:40</font></a> Jacob separated the
lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the
black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't
put them into Laban's flock.  <a name="C30V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:41</font></a> It happened, whenever the
stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes
of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
 <a name="C30V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:42</font></a> but when the flock were
feeble, he didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the
stronger Jacob's.  <a name="C30V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">30:43</font></a> The
man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male
servants, and camels and donkeys.
<p> <a name="C31V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:1</font></a> He heard the words of
Laban's sons, saying, &quot;Jacob has taken away all that was our
father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this
wealth.&quot;  <a name="C31V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:2</font></a> Jacob saw
the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as
before.  <a name="C31V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:3</font></a> Yahweh said to
Jacob, &quot;Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives,
and I will be with you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:4</font></a> Jacob sent and called
Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,  <a name="C31V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:5</font></a> and said to them, &quot;I see the
expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but
the God of my father has been with me.  <a name="C31V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:6</font></a> You know that I have served your
father with all of my strength.  <a name="C31V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:7</font></a> Your father has deceived me, and
changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me.  <a name="C31V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:8</font></a> If he said this, 'The speckled
will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this,
'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.
 <a name="C31V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:9</font></a> Thus God has taken away
your father's livestock, and given them to me.  <a name="C31V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:10</font></a> It happened during mating season
that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats
which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.  <a name="C31V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:11</font></a> The angel of God said to me in
the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'  <a name="C31V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:12</font></a> He said, 'Now lift up your eyes,
and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked,
speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
 <a name="C31V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:13</font></a> I am the God of Bethel,
where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get
out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:14</font></a> Rachel and Leah
answered him, &quot;Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our
father's house?  <a name="C31V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:15</font></a> Aren't
we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite
devoured our money.  <a name="C31V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:16</font></a> For
all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and
our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:17</font></a> Then Jacob rose up,
and set his sons and his wives on the camels,  <a name="C31V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:18</font></a> and he took away all his
livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the
livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father,
to the land of Canaan.  <a name="C31V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:19</font></a> Now Laban had gone to shear his
sheep: and Rachel stole the <a href="#N14">teraphim</a> that were her
father's.
<p> <a name="C31V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:20</font></a> Jacob deceived Laban
the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away.  <a name="C31V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:21</font></a> So he fled with all that he had.
He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of
Gilead.
<p> <a name="C31V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:22</font></a> Laban was told on the
third day that Jacob had fled.  <a name="C31V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:23</font></a> He took his relatives with him,
and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain
of Gilead.  <a name="C31V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:24</font></a> God came to
Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, &quot;Take
heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:25</font></a> Laban caught up with
Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his
relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.  <a name="C31V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:26</font></a> Laban said to Jacob, &quot;What
have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters
like captives of the sword?  <a name="C31V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:27</font></a> Why did you flee secretly, and
deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth
and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;  <a name="C31V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:28</font></a> and didn't allow me to kiss my
sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.  <a name="C31V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:29</font></a> It is in the power of my hand to
hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take
heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'
 <a name="C31V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:30</font></a> Now, you want to be
gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you
stolen my gods?&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:31</font></a> Jacob answered Laban,
&quot;Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your
daughters from me by force.'  <a name="C31V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:32</font></a> Anyone you find your gods with
shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and
take it.&quot; For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.
<p> <a name="C31V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:33</font></a> Laban went into
Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female
servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered
into Rachel's tent.  <a name="C31V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:34</font></a> Now
Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on
them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them.  <a name="C31V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:35</font></a> She said to her father,
&quot;Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the
manner of women is on me.&quot; He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.
<p> <a name="C31V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:36</font></a> Jacob was angry, and
argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, &quot;What is my trespass? What
is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?  <a name="C31V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:37</font></a> Now that you have felt around in
all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here
before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us
two.  <a name="C31V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:38</font></a> These twenty years
I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their
young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.  <a name="C31V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:39</font></a> That which was torn of animals,
I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it,
whether stolen by day or stolen by night.  <a name="C31V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:40</font></a> This was my situation: in the
day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled
from my eyes.  <a name="C31V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:41</font></a> These
twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for
your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my
wages ten times.  <a name="C31V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:42</font></a> Unless
the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been
with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my
affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:43</font></a> Laban answered Jacob,
&quot;The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the
flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this
day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
 <a name="C31V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:44</font></a> Now come, let us make a
covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C31V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:45</font></a> Jacob took a stone,
and set it up for a pillar.  <a name="C31V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:46</font></a> Jacob said to his relatives,
&quot;Gather stones.&quot; They took stones, and made a heap. They ate
there by the heap.  <a name="C31V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:47</font></a> Laban
called it <a href="#N15">Jegar Sahadutha,</a> but Jacob called it <a
href="#N16">Galeed.</a>  <a name="C31V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:48</font></a> Laban said, &quot;This heap is
witness between me and you this day.&quot; Therefore it was named Galeed
 <a name="C31V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:49</font></a> and Mizpah, for he said,
&quot;Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from
another.  <a name="C31V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:50</font></a> If you afflict
my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with
us; behold, God is witness between me and you.&quot;  <a name="C31V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:51</font></a> Laban said to Jacob, &quot;See
this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.
 <a name="C31V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:52</font></a> May this heap be a
witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap
to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me,
for harm.  <a name="C31V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:53</font></a> The God of
Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between
us.&quot; Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.  <a name="C31V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:54</font></a> Jacob offered a sacrifice in the
mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and
stayed all night in the mountain.  <a name="C31V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">31:55</font></a> Early in the morning, Laban rose
up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban
departed and returned to his place.
<p> <a name="C32V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:1</font></a> Jacob went on his way,
and the angels of God met him.  <a name="C32V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:2</font></a> When he saw them, Jacob said,
&quot;This is God's army.&quot; He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
<p> <a name="C32V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:3</font></a> Jacob sent messengers
in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of
Edom.  <a name="C32V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:4</font></a> He commanded them,
saying, &quot;This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what
your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and
stayed until now.  <a name="C32V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:5</font></a> I have
cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent
to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'&quot;  <a name="C32V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:6</font></a> The messengers returned to Jacob,
saying, &quot;We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to
meet you, and four hundred men with him.&quot;  <a name="C32V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:7</font></a> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and
was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks,
and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;  <a name="C32V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:8</font></a> and he said, &quot;If Esau comes
to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will
escape.&quot;  <a name="C32V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:9</font></a> Jacob said,
&quot;God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who
said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do
you good,'  <a name="C32V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:10</font></a> I am not
worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth,
which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over
this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.  <a name="C32V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:11</font></a> Please deliver me from the hand
of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and
strike me, and the mothers with the children.  <a name="C32V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:12</font></a> You said, 'I will surely do you
good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered
because there are so many.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:13</font></a> He lodged there that
night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his
brother:  <a name="C32V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:14</font></a> two hundred
female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
 <a name="C32V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:15</font></a> thirty milk camels and
their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
 <a name="C32V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:16</font></a> He delivered them into
the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants,
&quot;Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.&quot;
 <a name="C32V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:17</font></a> He commanded the
foremost, saying, &quot;When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you,
saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?'
 <a name="C32V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:18</font></a> Then you shall say,
'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau.
Behold, he also is behind us.'&quot;  <a name="C32V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:19</font></a> He commanded also the second,
and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, &quot;This is how
you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.  <a name="C32V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:20</font></a> You shall say, 'Not only that,
but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.'&quot; For, he said,
&quot;I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and
afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:21</font></a> So the present passed
over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
<p> <a name="C32V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:22</font></a> He rose up that
night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons,
and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.  <a name="C32V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:23</font></a> He took them, and sent them over
the stream, and sent over that which he had.  <a name="C32V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:24</font></a> Jacob was left alone, and
wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.  <a name="C32V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:25</font></a> When he saw that he didn't
prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of
Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled.  <a name="C32V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:26</font></a> The man said, &quot;Let me go,
for the day breaks.&quot;
<p>Jacob said, &quot;I won't let you go, unless you bless me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:27</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;What is your name?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Jacob.&quot;  <a name="C32V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:28</font></a> He said, &quot;Your name will no
longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with
men, and have prevailed.&quot;
<p> <a name="C32V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:29</font></a> Jacob asked him,
&quot;Please tell me your name.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Why is it that you ask what my name is?&quot; He blessed
him there.
<p> <a name="C32V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:30</font></a> Jacob called the name
of the place <a href="#N17">Peniel</a>: for, he said, &quot;I have seen
God face to face, and my life is preserved.&quot;  <a name="C32V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:31</font></a> The sun rose on him as he passed
over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.  <a name="C32V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">32:32</font></a> Therefore the children of Israel
don't eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to
this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of
the hip.
<p> <a name="C33V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:1</font></a> Jacob lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred
men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.
 <a name="C33V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:2</font></a> He put the handmaids and
their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and
Joseph at the rear.  <a name="C33V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:3</font></a> He
himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to his brother.
<p> <a name="C33V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:4</font></a> Esau ran to meet him,
embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.  <a name="C33V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:5</font></a> He lifted up his eyes, and saw
the women and the children; and said, &quot;Who are these with you?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;The children whom God has graciously given your
servant.&quot;  <a name="C33V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:6</font></a> Then the
handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.
 <a name="C33V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:7</font></a> Leah also and her
children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near
with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
<p> <a name="C33V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:8</font></a> Esau said, &quot;What
do you mean by all this company which I met?&quot;
<p>Jacob said, &quot;To find favor in the sight of my lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:9</font></a> Esau said, &quot;I
have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:10</font></a> Jacob said,
&quot;Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my
present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of
God, and you were pleased with me.  <a name="C33V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:11</font></a> Please take the gift that I
brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I
have enough.&quot; He urged him, and he took it.
<p> <a name="C33V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:12</font></a> Esau said, &quot;Let
us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:13</font></a> Jacob said to him,
&quot;My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and
herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all
the flocks will die.  <a name="C33V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:14</font></a> Please let my lord pass over
before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of
the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the
children, until I come to my lord to Seir.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:15</font></a> Esau said, &quot;Let
me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C33V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:16</font></a> So Esau returned that
day on his way to Seir.  <a name="C33V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:17</font></a> Jacob traveled to Succoth, built
himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name
of the place is called <a href="#N18">Succoth.</a>
<p> <a name="C33V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:18</font></a> Jacob came in peace
to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from
Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.  <a name="C33V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:19</font></a> He bought the parcel of ground
where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor,
Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.  <a name="C33V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">33:20</font></a> He erected an altar there, and
called it <a href="#N19">El Elohe Israel.</a>
<p> <a name="C34V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:1</font></a> Dinah, the daughter of
Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
 <a name="C34V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:2</font></a> Shechem the son of Hamor
the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her,
and humbled her.  <a name="C34V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:3</font></a> His soul
joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and
spoke kindly to the young lady.  <a name="C34V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:4</font></a> Shechem spoke to his father,
Hamor, saying, &quot;Get me this young lady as a wife.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:5</font></a> Now Jacob heard that
he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock
in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.  <a name="C34V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:6</font></a> Hamor the father of Shechem went
out to Jacob to talk with him.  <a name="C34V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:7</font></a> The sons of Jacob came in from
the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very
angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter;
a which thing ought not to be done.  <a name="C34V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:8</font></a> Hamor talked with them, saying,
&quot;The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give
her to him as a wife.  <a name="C34V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:9</font></a> Make marriages with us. Give your
daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.  <a name="C34V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:10</font></a> You shall dwell with us, and the
land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:11</font></a> Shechem said to her
father and to her brothers, &quot;Let me find favor in your eyes, and
whatever you will tell me I will give.  <a name="C34V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:12</font></a> Ask me a great amount for a
dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady
as a wife.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:13</font></a> The sons of Jacob
answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he
had defiled Dinah their sister,  <a name="C34V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:14</font></a> and said to them, &quot;We can't
do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is
a reproach to us.  <a name="C34V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:15</font></a> Only
on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that
every male of you be circumcised;  <a name="C34V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:16</font></a> then will we give our daughters
to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you,
and we will become one people.  <a name="C34V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:17</font></a> But if you will not listen to
us, to be circumcised, then we will take our <a href="#N20">sister,</a>
and we will be gone.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:18</font></a> Their words pleased
Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.  <a name="C34V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:19</font></a> The young man didn't wait to do
this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored
above all the house of his father.  <a name="C34V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:20</font></a> Hamor and Shechem, his son, came
to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
 <a name="C34V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:21</font></a> &quot;These men are
peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For
behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to
us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.  <a name="C34V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:22</font></a> Only on this condition will the
men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male
among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.  <a name="C34V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:23</font></a> Won't their livestock and their
possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to
them, and they will dwell with us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:24</font></a> All who went out of
the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every
male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.  <a name="C34V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:25</font></a> It happened on the third day,
when they were sore, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed
all the males.  <a name="C34V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:26</font></a> They
killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took
Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.  <a name="C34V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:27</font></a> Jacob's sons came on the dead,
and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.  <a name="C34V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:28</font></a> They took their flocks, their
herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the
field,  <a name="C34V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:29</font></a> and all their
wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took
as plunder everything that was in the house.  <a name="C34V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:30</font></a> Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,
&quot;You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the
land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They
will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be
destroyed, I and my house.&quot;
<p> <a name="C34V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">34:31</font></a> They said,
&quot;Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:1</font></a> God said to Jacob,
&quot;Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God,
who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:2</font></a> Then Jacob said to his
household, and to all who were with him, &quot;Put away the foreign gods
that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.  <a name="C35V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:3</font></a> Let us arise, and go up to
Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of
my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:4</font></a> They gave to Jacob all
the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in
their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.  <a name="C35V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:5</font></a> They traveled, and a terror of
God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the
sons of Jacob.  <a name="C35V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:6</font></a> So Jacob
came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all
the people who were with him.  <a name="C35V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:7</font></a> He built an altar there, and
called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when
he fled from the face of his brother.  <a name="C35V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:8</font></a> Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died,
and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called
Allon Bacuth.
<p> <a name="C35V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:9</font></a> God appeared to Jacob
again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.  <a name="C35V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:10</font></a> God said to him, &quot;Your name
is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be
Israel.&quot; He named him Israel.  <a name="C35V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:11</font></a> God said to him, &quot;I am God
Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will
be from you, and kings will come out of your body.  <a name="C35V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:12</font></a> The land which I gave to Abraham
and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give
the land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:13</font></a> God went up from him
in the place where he spoke with him.  <a name="C35V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:14</font></a> Jacob set up a pillar in the
place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink
offering on it, and poured oil on it.  <a name="C35V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:15</font></a> Jacob called the name of the
place where God spoke with him &quot;Bethel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:16</font></a> They traveled from
Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel
travailed. She had hard labor.  <a name="C35V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:17</font></a> When she was in hard labor, the
midwife said to her, &quot;Don't be afraid, for now you will have another
son.&quot;
<p> <a name="C35V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:18</font></a> It happened, as her
soul was departing (for she died), that she named him <a
href="#N21">Benoni,</a> but his father named him <a
href="#N22">Benjamin.</a>  <a name="C35V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:19</font></a> Rachel died, and was buried in
the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).  <a name="C35V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:20</font></a> Jacob set up a pillar on her
grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.  <a name="C35V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:21</font></a> Israel traveled, and spread his
tent beyond the tower of Eder.  <a name="C35V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:22</font></a> It happened, while Israel lived
in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's
concubine, and Israel heard of it.
<p>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  <a name="C35V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:23</font></a> The sons of Leah: Reuben
(Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  <a name="C35V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:24</font></a> The sons of Rachel: Joseph and
Benjamin.  <a name="C35V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:25</font></a> The sons of
Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali.  <a name="C35V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:26</font></a> The sons of Zilpah (Leah's
handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to
him in Paddan Aram.  <a name="C35V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:27</font></a> Jacob came to Isaac his father,
to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived
as foreigners.
<p> <a name="C35V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:28</font></a> The days of Isaac
were one hundred eighty years.  <a name="C35V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">35:29</font></a> Isaac gave up the spirit, and
died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and
Jacob, his sons, buried him.
<p> <a name="C36V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:1</font></a> Now this is the
history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).  <a name="C36V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:2</font></a> Esau took his wives from the
daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and
Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;
 <a name="C36V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:3</font></a> and Basemath, Ishmael's
daughter, sister of Nebaioth.  <a name="C36V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:4</font></a> Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz.
Basemath bore Reuel.  <a name="C36V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:5</font></a> Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and
Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of
Canaan.  <a name="C36V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:6</font></a> Esau took his
wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with
his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had
gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother
Jacob.  <a name="C36V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:7</font></a> For their
substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their
travels couldn't bear them because of their livestock.  <a name="C36V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:8</font></a> Esau lived in the hill country of
Seir. Esau is Edom.
<p> <a name="C36V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:9</font></a> This is the history of
the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of
Seir:  <a name="C36V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:10</font></a> these are the
names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and
Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau.  <a name="C36V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:11</font></a> The sons of Eliphaz were Teman,
Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.  <a name="C36V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:12</font></a> Timna was concubine to Eliphaz,
Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah,
Esau's wife.  <a name="C36V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:13</font></a> These are
the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons
of Basemath, Esau's wife.  <a name="C36V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:14</font></a> These were the sons of
Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: she
bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
<p> <a name="C36V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:15</font></a> These are the chiefs
of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief
Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,  <a name="C36V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:16</font></a> chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief
Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom;
these are the sons of Adah.  <a name="C36V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:17</font></a> These are the sons of Reuel,
Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these
are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons
of Basemath, Esau's wife.  <a name="C36V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:18</font></a> These are the sons of
Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are
the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
 <a name="C36V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:19</font></a> These are the sons of
Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
<p> <a name="C36V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:20</font></a> These are the sons of
Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
 <a name="C36V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:21</font></a> Dishon, Ezer, and
Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir
in the land of Edom.  <a name="C36V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:22</font></a> The
children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan's sister was Timna.  <a name="C36V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:23</font></a> These are the children of
Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.  <a name="C36V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:24</font></a> These are the children of
Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the
wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father.  <a name="C36V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:25</font></a> These are the children of Anah:
Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.  <a name="C36V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:26</font></a> These are the children of
Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.  <a name="C36V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:27</font></a> These are the children of Ezer:

chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to
their chiefs in the land of Seir.
<p> <a name="C36V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:31</font></a> These are the kings
who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the children
of Israel.  <a name="C36V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:32</font></a> Bela, the son
of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah.  <a name="C36V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:33</font></a> Bela died, and Jobab, the son of
Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:34</font></a> Jobab died, and Husham of the
land of the Temanites reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:35</font></a> Husham died, and Hadad, the son
of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place.
The name of his city was Avith.  <a name="C36V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:36</font></a> Hadad died, and Samlah of
Masrekah reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:37</font></a> Samlah died, and Shaul of
Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:38</font></a> Shaul died, and Baal Hanan, the
son of Achbor reigned in his place.  <a name="C36V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:39</font></a> Baal Hanan the son of Achbor
died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau. His
wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
<p> <a name="C36V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:40</font></a> These are the names
of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their
places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
 <a name="C36V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:41</font></a> chief Oholibamah, chief
Elah, chief Pinon,  <a name="C36V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:42</font></a> chief
Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,  <a name="C36V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">36:43</font></a> chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.
These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land
of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
<p> <a name="C37V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:1</font></a> Jacob lived in the
land of his father's travels, in the land of Canaan.  <a name="C37V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:2</font></a> This is the history of the
generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the
flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah,
his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.
 <a name="C37V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:3</font></a> Now Israel loved Joseph
more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he
made him a coat of many colors.  <a name="C37V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:4</font></a> His brothers saw that their
father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and
couldn't speak peaceably to him.
<p> <a name="C37V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:5</font></a> Joseph dreamed a
dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.
 <a name="C37V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:6</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:  <a name="C37V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:7</font></a> for behold, we were binding
sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright;
and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:8</font></a> His brothers said to
him, &quot;Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion
over us?&quot; They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his
words.  <a name="C37V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:9</font></a> He dreamed yet
another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, &quot;Behold, I have
dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven
stars bowed down to me.&quot;  <a name="C37V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:10</font></a> He told it to his father and to
his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, &quot;What is this
dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers
indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?&quot;  <a name="C37V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:11</font></a> His brothers envied him, but his
father kept this saying in mind.
<p> <a name="C37V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:12</font></a> His brothers went to
feed their father's flock in Shechem.  <a name="C37V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:13</font></a> Israel said to Joseph,
&quot;Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will
send you to them.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:14</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the
flock; and bring me word again.&quot; So he sent him out of the valley of
Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  <a name="C37V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:15</font></a> A certain man found him, and
behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, &quot;What are
you looking for?&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:16</font></a> He said, &quot;I am
looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the
flock.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:17</font></a> The man said,
&quot;They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to
Dothan.'&quot;
<p>Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.  <a name="C37V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:18</font></a> They saw him afar off, and
before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.
 <a name="C37V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:19</font></a> They said one to
another, &quot;Behold, this dreamer comes.  <a name="C37V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:20</font></a> Come now therefore, and let's
kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil
animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:21</font></a> Reuben heard it, and
delivered him out of their hand, and said, &quot;Let's not take his
life.&quot;  <a name="C37V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:22</font></a> Reuben said
to them, &quot;Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the
wilderness, but lay no hand on him&quot;--that he might deliver him out of
their hand, to restore him to his father.  <a name="C37V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:23</font></a> It happened, when Joseph came to
his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many
colors that was on him;  <a name="C37V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:24</font></a> and they took him, and threw him
into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
<p> <a name="C37V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:25</font></a> They sat down to eat
bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of
Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and
balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  <a name="C37V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:26</font></a> Judah said to his brothers,
&quot;What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
 <a name="C37V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:27</font></a> Come, and let's sell him
to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother,
our flesh.&quot; His brothers listened to him.  <a name="C37V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:28</font></a> Midianites who were merchants
passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold
Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph
into Egypt.
<p> <a name="C37V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:29</font></a> Reuben returned to
the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
 <a name="C37V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:30</font></a> He returned to his
brothers, and said, &quot;The child is no more; and I, where will I
go?&quot;  <a name="C37V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:31</font></a> They took
Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
 <a name="C37V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:32</font></a> They took the coat of
many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, &quot;We have
found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not.&quot;
<p> <a name="C37V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:33</font></a> He recognized it, and
said, &quot;It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph
is without doubt torn in pieces.&quot;  <a name="C37V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:34</font></a> Jacob tore his clothes, and put
sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.  <a name="C37V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:35</font></a> All his sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said,
&quot;For I will go down to <a href="#N23">Sheol</a> to my son
mourning.&quot; His father wept for him.  <a name="C37V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">37:36</font></a> The Midianites sold him into
Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
<p> <a name="C38V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:1</font></a> It happened at that
time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.  <a name="C38V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:2</font></a> Judah saw there a daughter of a
certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.
 <a name="C38V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:3</font></a> She conceived, and bore a
son; and he named him Er.  <a name="C38V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:4</font></a> She conceived again, and bore a
son; and she named him Onan.  <a name="C38V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:5</font></a> She yet again bore a son, and
named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.  <a name="C38V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:6</font></a> Judah took a wife for Er, his
firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  <a name="C38V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:7</font></a> Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked
in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him.  <a name="C38V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:8</font></a> Judah said to Onan, &quot;Go in
to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to
her, and raise up seed to your brother.&quot;  <a name="C38V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:9</font></a> Onan knew that the seed wouldn't
be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he
spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.  <a name="C38V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:10</font></a> The thing which he did was evil
in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also.  <a name="C38V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:11</font></a> Then Judah said to Tamar, his
daughter-in-law, &quot;Remain a widow in your father's house, until
Shelah, my son, is grown up;&quot; for he said, &quot;Lest he also die,
like his brothers.&quot; Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
<p> <a name="C38V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:12</font></a> After many days,
Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up
to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.
 <a name="C38V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:13</font></a> It was told Tamar,
saying, &quot;Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear
his sheep.&quot;  <a name="C38V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:14</font></a> She
took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with
her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by
the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't
given to him as a wife.  <a name="C38V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:15</font></a> When Judah saw her, he thought
that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.  <a name="C38V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:16</font></a> He turned to her by the way, and
said, &quot;Please come, let me come in to you,&quot; for he didn't know
that she was his daughter-in-law.
<p>She said, &quot;What will you give me, that you may come in to me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:17</font></a> He said, &quot;I will
send you a kid of the goats from the flock.&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:18</font></a> He said, &quot;What
pledge will I give you?&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in
your hand.&quot;
<p>He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
 <a name="C38V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:19</font></a> She arose, and went
away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her
widowhood.  <a name="C38V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:20</font></a> Judah sent
the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive
the pledge from the woman's hand, but he didn't find her.  <a name="C38V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:21</font></a> Then he asked the men of her
place, saying, &quot;Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the
road?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;There has been no prostitute here.&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:22</font></a> He returned to Judah,
and said, &quot;I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said,
'There has been no prostitute here.'&quot;  <a name="C38V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:23</font></a> Judah said, &quot;Let her keep
it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you haven't found
her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:24</font></a> It happened about
three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, &quot;Tamar, your
daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is
with child by prostitution.&quot;
<p>Judah said, &quot;Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.&quot;  <a name="C38V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:25</font></a> When she was brought forth, she
sent to her father-in-law, saying, &quot;By the man, whose these are, I am
with child.&quot; She also said, &quot;Please discern whose are these--the
signet, and the cords, and the staff.&quot;
<p> <a name="C38V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:26</font></a> Judah acknowledged
them, and said, &quot;She is more righteous than I, because I didn't give
her to Shelah, my son.&quot;
<p>He knew her again no more.  <a name="C38V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:27</font></a> It happened in the time of her
travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.  <a name="C38V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:28</font></a> When she travailed, one put out
a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand,
saying, &quot;This came out first.&quot;  <a name="C38V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:29</font></a> It happened, as he drew back his
hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, &quot;Why have you
made a breach for yourself?&quot; Therefore his name was called <a
href="#N24">Perez.</a>  <a name="C38V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">38:30</font></a> Afterward his brother came out,
that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called <a
href="#N25">Zerah.</a>
<p> <a name="C39V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:1</font></a> Joseph was brought
down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the
guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had
brought him down there.  <a name="C39V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:2</font></a> Yahweh was with Joseph, and he
was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
 <a name="C39V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:3</font></a> His master saw that
Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his
hand.  <a name="C39V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:4</font></a> Joseph found favor
in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his
house, and all that he had he put into his hand.  <a name="C39V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:5</font></a> It happened from the time that he
made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh
blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Yahweh
was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.  <a name="C39V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:6</font></a> He left all that he had in
Joseph's hand. He didn't concern himself with anything, except for the
food which he ate.
<p>Joseph was well-built and handsome.  <a name="C39V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:7</font></a> It happened after these things,
that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &quot;Lie
with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:8</font></a> But he refused, and
said to his master's wife, &quot;Behold, my master doesn't know what is
with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.  <a name="C39V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:9</font></a> He isn't greater in this house
than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are
his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
God?&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:10</font></a> As she spoke to
Joseph day by day, he didn't listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with
her.  <a name="C39V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:11</font></a> About this time, he
went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the
house inside.  <a name="C39V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:12</font></a> She caught
him by his garment, saying, &quot;Lie with me!&quot;
<p>He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.  <a name="C39V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:13</font></a> When she saw that he had left
his garment in her hand, and had run outside,  <a name="C39V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:14</font></a> she called to the men of her
house, and spoke to them, saying, &quot;Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew
to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud
voice.  <a name="C39V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:15</font></a> It happened, when
he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by
me, and ran outside.&quot;  <a name="C39V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:16</font></a> She laid up his garment by her,
until his master came home.  <a name="C39V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:17</font></a> She spoke to him according to
these words, saying, &quot;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to
us, came in to me to mock me,  <a name="C39V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:18</font></a> and it happened, as I lifted up
my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&quot;
<p> <a name="C39V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:19</font></a> It happened, when his
master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying,
&quot;This is what your servant did to me,&quot; that his wrath was
kindled.  <a name="C39V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:20</font></a> Joseph's master
took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's
prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.  <a name="C39V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:21</font></a> But Yahweh was with Joseph, and
showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of
the prison.  <a name="C39V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:22</font></a> The keeper
of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the
prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.  <a name="C39V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">39:23</font></a> The keeper of the prison didn't
look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him;
and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.
<p> <a name="C40V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:1</font></a> It happened after
these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended
their lord, the king of Egypt.  <a name="C40V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:2</font></a> Pharaoh was angry with his two
officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.  <a name="C40V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:3</font></a> He put them in custody in the
house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph
was bound.  <a name="C40V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:4</font></a> The captain of
the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed
in prison many days.  <a name="C40V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:5</font></a> They
both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according
to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the
king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.  <a name="C40V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:6</font></a> Joseph came in to them in the
morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.  <a name="C40V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:7</font></a> He asked Pharaoh's officers who
were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, &quot;Why do you
look so sad today?&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:8</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret
it.&quot;
<p>Joseph said to them, &quot;Don't interpretations belong to God? Please
tell it to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:9</font></a> The chief cupbearer
told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, &quot;In my dream, behold, a
vine was in front of me,  <a name="C40V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:10</font></a> and in the vine were three
branches. It was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its
clusters brought forth ripe grapes.  <a name="C40V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:11</font></a> Pharaoh's cup was in my hand;
and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the
cup into Pharaoh's hand.&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:12</font></a> Joseph said to him,
&quot;This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
 <a name="C40V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:13</font></a> Within three more days,
Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will
give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his
cupbearer.  <a name="C40V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:14</font></a> But remember
me when it will be well with you, and show kindness, please, to me, and
make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.  <a name="C40V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:15</font></a> For indeed, I was stolen away
out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon.&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:16</font></a> When the chief baker
saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, &quot;I also was
in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
 <a name="C40V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:17</font></a> In the uppermost basket
there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out
of the basket on my head.&quot;
<p> <a name="C40V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:18</font></a> Joseph answered,
&quot;This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.
 <a name="C40V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:19</font></a> Within three more days,
Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree;
and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.&quot;  <a name="C40V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:20</font></a> It happened the third day, which
was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he
lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker
among his servants.  <a name="C40V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:21</font></a> He
restored the chief cupbearer to his position again, and he gave the cup
into Pharaoh's hand;  <a name="C40V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:22</font></a> but
he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.  <a name="C40V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">40:23</font></a> Yet the chief cupbearer didn't
remember Joseph, but forgot him.
<p> <a name="C41V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:1</font></a> It happened at the end
of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the
river.  <a name="C41V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:2</font></a> Behold, there came
up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh
grass.  <a name="C41V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:3</font></a> Behold, seven
other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood
by the other cattle on the brink of the river.  <a name="C41V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:4</font></a> The ugly and thin cattle ate up
the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.  <a name="C41V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:5</font></a> He slept and dreamed a second
time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and
good.  <a name="C41V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:6</font></a> Behold, seven heads
of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
 <a name="C41V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:7</font></a> The thin heads of grain
swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold,
it was a dream.  <a name="C41V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:8</font></a> It
happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and
called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his
dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
<p> <a name="C41V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:9</font></a> Then the chief
cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, &quot;I remember my faults today.
 <a name="C41V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:10</font></a> Pharaoh was angry with
his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the
guard, me and the chief baker.  <a name="C41V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:11</font></a> We dreamed a dream in one night,
I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his
dream.  <a name="C41V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:12</font></a> There was with us
there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we
told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to
his dream he interpreted.  <a name="C41V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:13</font></a> It happened, as he interpreted
to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:14</font></a> Then Pharaoh sent and
called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved
himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.  <a name="C41V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:15</font></a> Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I
have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have
heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:16</font></a> Joseph answered
Pharaoh, saying, &quot;It isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of
peace.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:17</font></a> Pharaoh spoke to
Joseph, &quot;In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:
 <a name="C41V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:18</font></a> and behold, there came
up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh
grass,  <a name="C41V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:19</font></a> and behold, seven
other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I
never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.  <a name="C41V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:20</font></a> The thin and ugly cattle ate up
the first seven fat cattle,  <a name="C41V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:21</font></a> and when they had eaten them up,
it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly,
as at the beginning. So I awoke.  <a name="C41V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:22</font></a> I saw in my dream, and behold,
seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:  <a name="C41V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:23</font></a> and behold, seven heads of
grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after
them.  <a name="C41V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:24</font></a> The thin heads of
grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the
magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:25</font></a> Joseph said to
Pharaoh, &quot;The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has
declared to Pharaoh.  <a name="C41V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:26</font></a> The
seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are
seven years. The dream is one.  <a name="C41V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:27</font></a> The seven thin and ugly cattle
that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of
grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
 <a name="C41V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:28</font></a> That is the thing which
I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.
 <a name="C41V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:29</font></a> Behold, there come seven
years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.  <a name="C41V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:30</font></a> There will arise after them
seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of
Egypt. The famine will consume the land,  <a name="C41V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:31</font></a> and the plenty will not be known
in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very
grievous.  <a name="C41V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:32</font></a> The dream was
doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will
shortly bring it to pass.
<p> <a name="C41V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:33</font></a> &quot;Now therefore
let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of
Egypt.  <a name="C41V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:34</font></a> Let Pharaoh do
this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth
part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years.  <a name="C41V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:35</font></a> Let them gather all the food of
these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for
food in the cities, and let them keep it.  <a name="C41V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:36</font></a> The food will be for a store to
the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of
Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:37</font></a> The thing was good in
the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.  <a name="C41V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:38</font></a> Pharaoh said to his servants,
&quot;Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of
God?&quot;  <a name="C41V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:39</font></a> Pharaoh said
to Joseph, &quot;Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so
discreet and wise as you.  <a name="C41V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:40</font></a> You shall be over my house, and
according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I
will be greater than you.&quot;  <a name="C41V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:41</font></a> Pharaoh said to Joseph,
&quot;Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&quot;  <a name="C41V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:42</font></a> Pharaoh took off his signet ring
from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of
fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,  <a name="C41V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:43</font></a> and he made him to ride in the
second chariot which he had. They cried before him, &quot;Bow the
knee!&quot; He set him over all the land of Egypt.  <a name="C41V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:44</font></a> Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I
am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in
all the land of Egypt.&quot;  <a name="C41V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:45</font></a> Pharaoh called Joseph's name
Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera
priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
<p> <a name="C41V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:46</font></a> Joseph was thirty
years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from
the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
 <a name="C41V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:47</font></a> In the seven plenteous
years the earth brought forth abundantly.  <a name="C41V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:48</font></a> He gathered up all the food of
the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in
the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up
in the same.  <a name="C41V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:49</font></a> Joseph laid
up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for
it was without number.  <a name="C41V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:50</font></a> To Joseph were born two sons
before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera
priest of On, bore to him.  <a name="C41V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:51</font></a> Joseph called the name of the
firstborn <a href="#N26">Manasseh,</a> &quot;For,&quot; he said, &quot;God
has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.&quot;  <a name="C41V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:52</font></a> The name of the second, he
called <a href="#N27">Ephraim</a>: &quot;For God has made me fruitful in
the land of my affliction.&quot;
<p> <a name="C41V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:53</font></a> The seven years of
plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.  <a name="C41V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:54</font></a> The seven years of famine began
to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in
all the land of Egypt there was bread.  <a name="C41V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:55</font></a> When all the land of Egypt was
famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all
the Egyptians, &quot;Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.&quot;  <a name="C41V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:56</font></a> The famine was over all the
surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the
Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.  <a name="C41V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:57</font></a> All countries came into Egypt,
to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
<p> <a name="C42V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:1</font></a> Now Jacob saw that
there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, &quot;Why do you
look at one another?&quot;  <a name="C42V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:2</font></a> He said, &quot;Behold, I have
heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from
there, so that we may live, and not die.&quot;  <a name="C42V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:3</font></a> Joseph's ten brothers went down
to buy grain from Egypt.  <a name="C42V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:4</font></a> But Jacob didn't send Benjamin,
Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said, &quot;Lest perhaps harm
happen to him.&quot;  <a name="C42V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:5</font></a> The
sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the
land of Canaan.  <a name="C42V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:6</font></a> Joseph
was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of
the land. Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with
their faces to the earth.  <a name="C42V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:7</font></a> Joseph saw his brothers, and he
recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with
them. He said to them, &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;From the land of Canaan to buy food.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:8</font></a> Joseph recognized his
brothers, but they didn't recognize him.  <a name="C42V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:9</font></a> Joseph remembered the dreams
which he dreamed about them, and said to them, &quot;You are spies! You
have come to see the nakedness of the land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:10</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.  <a name="C42V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:11</font></a> We are all one man's sons; we
are honest men. Your servants are not spies.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:12</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:13</font></a> They said, &quot;We,
your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of
Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is
no more.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:14</font></a> Joseph said to them,
&quot;It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies.'  <a name="C42V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:15</font></a> By this you shall be tested. By
the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go forth from here, unless your
youngest brother comes here.  <a name="C42V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:16</font></a> Send one of you, and let him get
your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested,
whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you
are spies.&quot;  <a name="C42V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:17</font></a> He put
them all together into custody for three days.
<p> <a name="C42V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:18</font></a> Joseph said to them
the third day, &quot;Do this, and live, for I fear God.  <a name="C42V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:19</font></a> If you are honest men, then let
one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for
the famine of your houses.  <a name="C42V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:20</font></a> Bring your youngest brother to
me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die.&quot;
<p>They did so.  <a name="C42V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:21</font></a> They
said one to another, &quot;We are certainly guilty concerning our brother,
in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we
wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.&quot;  <a name="C42V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:22</font></a> Reuben answered them, saying,
&quot;Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against the child,' and you
wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.&quot;
 <a name="C42V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:23</font></a> They didn't know that
Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.  <a name="C42V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:24</font></a> He turned himself away from
them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took
Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.  <a name="C42V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:25</font></a> Then Joseph gave a command to
fill their bags with grain, and to restore every man's money into his
sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
<p> <a name="C42V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:26</font></a> They loaded their
donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.  <a name="C42V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:27</font></a> As one of them opened his sack
to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it
was in the mouth of his sack.  <a name="C42V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:28</font></a> He said to his brothers,
&quot;My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!&quot; Their hearts
failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, &quot;What
is this that God has done to us?&quot;  <a name="C42V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:29</font></a> They came to Jacob their father,
to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
 <a name="C42V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:30</font></a> &quot;The man, the lord
of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
 <a name="C42V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:31</font></a> We said to him, 'We are
honest men. We are no spies.  <a name="C42V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:32</font></a> We are twelve brothers, sons of
our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father
in the land of Canaan.'  <a name="C42V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:33</font></a> The man, the lord of the land,
said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of
your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and
go your way.  <a name="C42V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:34</font></a> Bring your
youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that
you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall
trade in the land.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:35</font></a> It happened as they
emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his
sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were
afraid.  <a name="C42V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:36</font></a> Jacob, their
father, said to them, &quot;You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is
no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these
things are against me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:37</font></a> Reuben spoke to his
father, saying, &quot;Kill my two sons, if I don't bring him to you.
Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:38</font></a> He said, &quot;My son
shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left.
If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring
down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:1</font></a> The famine was severe
in the land.  <a name="C43V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:2</font></a> It happened,
when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt,
their father said to them, &quot;Go again, buy us a little more food.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:3</font></a> Judah spoke to him,
saying, &quot;The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my
face, unless your brother is with you.'  <a name="C43V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:4</font></a> If you'll send our brother with
us, we'll go down and buy you food,  <a name="C43V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:5</font></a> but if you'll not send him, we'll
not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless
your brother is with you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:6</font></a> Israel said, &quot;Why
did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another
brother?&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:7</font></a> They said, &quot;The
man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives,
saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just
answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say,
'Bring your brother down?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:8</font></a> Judah said to Israel,
his father, &quot;Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that
we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
 <a name="C43V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:9</font></a> I'll be collateral for
him. From my hand will you require him. If I don't bring him to you, and
set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,  <a name="C43V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:10</font></a> for if we hadn't delayed, surely
we would have returned a second time by now.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:11</font></a> Their father, Israel,
said to them, &quot;If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice
fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a
little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;  <a name="C43V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:12</font></a> and take double money in your
hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your
sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.  <a name="C43V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:13</font></a> Take your brother also, get up,
and return to the man.  <a name="C43V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:14</font></a> May God Almighty give you mercy
before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and
Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:15</font></a> The men took that
present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got
up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  <a name="C43V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:16</font></a> When Joseph saw Benjamin with
them, he said to the steward of his house, &quot;Bring the men into the
house, and butcher an animal, and make ready; for the men will dine with
me at noon.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:17</font></a> The man did as Joseph
commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.  <a name="C43V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:18</font></a> The men were afraid, because
they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, &quot;Because of the
money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in;
that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves,
along with our donkeys.&quot;  <a name="C43V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:19</font></a> They came near to the steward of
Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,  <a name="C43V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:20</font></a> and said, &quot;Oh, my lord, we
indeed came down the first time to buy food.  <a name="C43V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:21</font></a> When we came to the lodging
place, we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth
of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our
hand.  <a name="C43V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:22</font></a> We have brought
down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money
in our sacks.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:23</font></a> He said, &quot;Peace
be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has
given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.&quot; He brought
Simeon out to them.  <a name="C43V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:24</font></a> The
man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they
washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.  <a name="C43V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:25</font></a> They made ready the present for
Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
<p> <a name="C43V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:26</font></a> When Joseph came
home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house,
and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.  <a name="C43V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:27</font></a> He asked them of their welfare,
and said, &quot;Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he
yet alive?&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:28</font></a> They said, &quot;Your
servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.&quot; They bowed the
head, and did homage.  <a name="C43V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:29</font></a> He
lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and
said, &quot;Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?&quot;
He said, &quot;God be gracious to you, my son.&quot;  <a name="C43V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:30</font></a> Joseph hurried, for his heart
yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into
his room, and wept there.  <a name="C43V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:31</font></a> He washed his face, and came
out. He controlled himself, and said, &quot;Serve the meal.&quot;
<p> <a name="C43V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:32</font></a> They served him by
himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by
themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for
that is an abomination to the Egyptians.  <a name="C43V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:33</font></a> They sat before him, the
firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his
youth, and the men marveled one with another.  <a name="C43V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">43:34</font></a> He sent portions to them from
before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of
theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
<p> <a name="C44V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:1</font></a> He commanded the
steward of his house, saying, &quot;Fill the men's sacks with food, as
much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
 <a name="C44V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:2</font></a> Put my cup, the silver
cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.&quot; He
did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  <a name="C44V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:3</font></a> As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.  <a name="C44V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:4</font></a> When they had gone out of the
city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, &quot;Up,
follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you
rewarded evil for good?  <a name="C44V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:5</font></a> Isn't this that from which my
lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so
doing.'&quot;  <a name="C44V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:6</font></a> He overtook
them, and he spoke these words to them.
<p> <a name="C44V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:7</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your
servants that they should do such a thing!  <a name="C44V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:8</font></a> Behold, the money, which we found
in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan.
How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?  <a name="C44V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:9</font></a> With whoever of your servants it
be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants.&quot;
<p> <a name="C44V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:10</font></a> He said, &quot;Now
also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be
my bondservant; and you will be blameless.&quot;
<p> <a name="C44V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:11</font></a> Then they hurried,
and every man took his sack down to the ground, and every man opened his
sack.  <a name="C44V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:12</font></a> He searched,
beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found
in Benjamin's sack.  <a name="C44V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:13</font></a> Then
they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to
the city.
<p> <a name="C44V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:14</font></a> Judah and his
brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the
ground before him.  <a name="C44V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:15</font></a> Joseph said to them, &quot;What
deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can
indeed divine?&quot;
<p> <a name="C44V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:16</font></a> Judah said,
&quot;What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear
ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are
my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is
found.&quot;
<p> <a name="C44V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:17</font></a> He said, &quot;Far be
it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he
will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your
father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C44V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:18</font></a> Then Judah came near
to him, and said, &quot;Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word
in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for
you are even as Pharaoh.  <a name="C44V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:19</font></a> My lord asked his servants,
saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'  <a name="C44V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:20</font></a> We said to my lord, 'We have a
father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his
brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves
him.'  <a name="C44V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:21</font></a> You said to your
servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'  <a name="C44V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:22</font></a> We said to my lord, 'The boy
can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father
would die.'  <a name="C44V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:23</font></a> You said to
your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will
see my face no more.'  <a name="C44V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:24</font></a> It
happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words
of my lord.  <a name="C44V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:25</font></a> Our father
said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'  <a name="C44V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:26</font></a> We said, 'We can't go down. If
our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see
the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.'  <a name="C44V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:27</font></a> Your servant, my father, said to
us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons:  <a name="C44V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:28</font></a> and the one went out from me,
and I said, &quot;Surely he is torn in pieces;&quot; and I haven't seen
him since.  <a name="C44V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:29</font></a> If you take
this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my
gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'  <a name="C44V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:30</font></a> Now therefore when I come to
your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; seeing that his life
is bound up in the boy's life;  <a name="C44V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:31</font></a> it will happen, when he sees
that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down
the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.  <a name="C44V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:32</font></a> For your servant became
collateral for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I don't bring him to you,
then I will bear the blame to my father forever.'  <a name="C44V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:33</font></a> Now therefore, please let your
servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy
go up with his brothers.  <a name="C44V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">44:34</font></a> For how will I go up to my
father, if the boy isn't with me?--lest I see the evil that will come on
my father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C45V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:1</font></a> Then Joseph couldn't
control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried,
&quot;Cause every man to go out from me!&quot; No one else stood with him,
while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.  <a name="C45V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:2</font></a> He wept aloud. The Egyptians
heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.  <a name="C45V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:3</font></a> Joseph said to his brothers,
&quot;I am Joseph! Does my father still live?&quot;
<p>His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his
presence.  <a name="C45V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:4</font></a> Joseph said to
his brothers, &quot;Come near to me, please.&quot;
<p>They came near. &quot;He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold
into Egypt.  <a name="C45V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:5</font></a> Now don't be
grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me
before you to preserve life.  <a name="C45V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:6</font></a> For these two years the famine
has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be
neither plowing nor harvest.  <a name="C45V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:7</font></a> God sent me before you to
preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great
deliverance.  <a name="C45V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:8</font></a> So now it
wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to
Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
 <a name="C45V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:9</font></a> Hurry, and go up to my
father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, &quot;God has
made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't wait.  <a name="C45V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:10</font></a> You shall dwell in the land of
Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children's
children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.  <a name="C45V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:11</font></a> There I will nourish you; for
there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and
your household, and all that you have.&quot;'  <a name="C45V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:12</font></a> Behold, your eyes see, and the
eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
 <a name="C45V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:13</font></a> You shall tell my father
of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry
and bring my father down here.&quot;  <a name="C45V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:14</font></a> He fell on his brother
Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.  <a name="C45V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:15</font></a> He kissed all his brothers, and
wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
<p> <a name="C45V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:16</font></a> The report of it was
heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, &quot;Joseph's brothers have come.&quot;
It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.  <a name="C45V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:17</font></a> Pharaoh said to Joseph,
&quot;Tell your brothers, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to
the land of Canaan.  <a name="C45V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:18</font></a> Take
your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the
good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.'  <a name="C45V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:19</font></a> Now you are commanded: do this.
Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your
wives, and bring your father, and come.  <a name="C45V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:20</font></a> Also, don't concern yourselves
about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is
yours.&quot;
<p> <a name="C45V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:21</font></a> The sons of Israel
did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
and gave them provision for the way.  <a name="C45V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:22</font></a> He gave each one of them changes
of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and
five changes of clothing.  <a name="C45V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:23</font></a> To his father, he sent after
this manner: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten
female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by
the way.  <a name="C45V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:24</font></a> So he sent his
brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, &quot;See that you
don't quarrel on the way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C45V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:25</font></a> They went up out of
Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.  <a name="C45V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:26</font></a> They told him, saying,
&quot;Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of
Egypt.&quot; His heart fainted, for he didn't believe them.  <a name="C45V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:27</font></a> They told him all the words of
Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had
sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.  <a name="C45V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">45:28</font></a> Israel said, &quot;It is enough.
Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C46V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:1</font></a> Israel traveled with
all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God
of his father, Isaac.  <a name="C46V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:2</font></a> God
spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, &quot;Jacob,
Jacob!&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;
<p> <a name="C46V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:3</font></a> He said, &quot;I am
God, the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go down into Egypt, for
there I will make of you a great nation.  <a name="C46V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:4</font></a> I will go down with you into
Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your
eyes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C46V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:5</font></a> Jacob rose up from
Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their
little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to
carry him.  <a name="C46V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:6</font></a> They took
their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of
Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacob, and all his seed with him,  <a name="C46V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:7</font></a> his sons, and his sons' sons with
him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed
with him into Egypt.
<p> <a name="C46V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:8</font></a> These are the names of
the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben,
Jacob's firstborn.  <a name="C46V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:9</font></a> The
sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.  <a name="C46V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:10</font></a> The sons of Simeon: Jemuel,
Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
 <a name="C46V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:11</font></a> The sons of Levi:
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  <a name="C46V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:12</font></a> The sons of Judah: Er, Onan,
Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The
sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.  <a name="C46V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:13</font></a> The sons of Issachar: Tola,
Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.  <a name="C46V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:14</font></a> The sons of Zebulun: Sered,
Elon, and Jahleel.  <a name="C46V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:15</font></a> These
are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his
daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were
thirty-three.  <a name="C46V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:16</font></a> The sons
of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.  <a name="C46V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:17</font></a> The sons of Asher: Imnah,
Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber
and Malchiel.  <a name="C46V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:18</font></a> These are
the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she
bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.  <a name="C46V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:19</font></a> The sons of Rachel, Jacob's
wife: Joseph and Benjamin.  <a name="C46V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:20</font></a> To Joseph in the land of Egypt
were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera,
priest of On, bore to him.  <a name="C46V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:21</font></a> The sons of Benjamin: Bela,
Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.  <a name="C46V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:22</font></a> These are the sons of Rachel,
who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.  <a name="C46V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:23</font></a> The son of Dan: Hushim.  <a name="C46V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:24</font></a> The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel,
Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.  <a name="C46V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:25</font></a> These are the sons of Bilhah,
whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all
the souls were seven.  <a name="C46V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:26</font></a> All the souls who came with
Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct descendants, besides Jacob's sons'
wives, all the souls were sixty-six.  <a name="C46V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:27</font></a> The sons of Joseph, who were
born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob,
who came into Egypt, were seventy.
<p> <a name="C46V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:28</font></a> He sent Judah before
him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into
the land of Goshen.  <a name="C46V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:29</font></a> Joseph made ready his chariot,
and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to
him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.  <a name="C46V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:30</font></a> Israel said to Joseph, &quot;Now
let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.&quot;
<p> <a name="C46V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:31</font></a> Joseph said to his
brothers, and to his father's house, &quot;I will go up, and speak with
Pharaoh, and will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house, who were
in the land of Canaan, have come to me.  <a name="C46V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:32</font></a> These men are shepherds, for
they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks,
and their herds, and all that they have.'  <a name="C46V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:33</font></a> It will happen, when Pharaoh
summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?'  <a name="C46V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">46:34</font></a> that you shall say, 'Your
servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now,
both we, and our fathers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for
every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:1</font></a> Then Joseph went in
and told Pharaoh, and said, &quot;My father and my brothers, with their
flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of
Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.&quot;  <a name="C47V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:2</font></a> From among his brothers he took
five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.  <a name="C47V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:3</font></a> Pharaoh said to his brothers,
&quot;What is your occupation?&quot;
<p>They said to Pharaoh, &quot;Your servants are shepherds, both we, and
our fathers.&quot;  <a name="C47V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:4</font></a> They
said to Pharaoh, &quot;We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for
there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in
the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the
land of Goshen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:5</font></a> Pharaoh spoke to
Joseph, saying, &quot;Your father and your brothers have come to you.
 <a name="C47V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:6</font></a> The land of Egypt is
before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the
land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among
them, then put them in charge of my livestock.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:7</font></a> Joseph brought in
Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
 <a name="C47V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:8</font></a> Pharaoh said to Jacob,
&quot;How many are the days of the years of your life?&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:9</font></a> Jacob said to Pharaoh,
&quot;The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years.
Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not
attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of
their pilgrimage.&quot;  <a name="C47V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:10</font></a> Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went
out from the presence of Pharaoh.
<p> <a name="C47V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:11</font></a> Joseph placed his
father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt,
in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
 <a name="C47V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:12</font></a> Joseph nourished his
father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, with bread,
according to their families.
<p> <a name="C47V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:13</font></a> There was no bread in
all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt
and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.  <a name="C47V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:14</font></a> Joseph gathered up all the money
that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the
grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
house.  <a name="C47V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:15</font></a> When the money
was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the
Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, &quot;Give us bread, for why should we
die in your presence? For our money fails.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:16</font></a> Joseph said,
&quot;Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock,
if your money is gone.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:17</font></a> They brought their
livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the
horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he
fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.
 <a name="C47V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:18</font></a> When that year was
ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, &quot;We will
not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of
livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord,
but our bodies, and our lands.  <a name="C47V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:19</font></a> Why should we die before your
eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our
land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not
die, and that the land won't be desolate.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:20</font></a> So Joseph bought all
the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field,
because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's.
 <a name="C47V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:21</font></a> As for the people, he
moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the
other end of it.  <a name="C47V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:22</font></a> Only he
didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from
Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they
didn't sell their land.  <a name="C47V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:23</font></a> Then Joseph said to the people,
&quot;Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold,
here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.  <a name="C47V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:24</font></a> It will happen at the harvests,
that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own,
for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for
food for your little ones.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:25</font></a> They said, &quot;You
have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we
will be Pharaoh's servants.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:26</font></a> Joseph made it a
statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have
the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.
<p> <a name="C47V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:27</font></a> Israel lived in the
land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions
therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.  <a name="C47V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:28</font></a> Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one
hundred forty-seven years.  <a name="C47V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:29</font></a> The time drew near that Israel
must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, &quot;If now I
have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and
deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury me in Egypt,  <a name="C47V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:30</font></a> but when I sleep with my
fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying
place.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;I will do as you have said.&quot;
<p> <a name="C47V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">47:31</font></a> He said, &quot;Swear
to me,&quot; and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.
<p> <a name="C48V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:1</font></a> It happened after
these things, that someone said to Joseph, &quot;Behold, your father is
sick.&quot; He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.  <a name="C48V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:2</font></a> Someone told Jacob, and said,
&quot;Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,&quot; and Israel strengthened
himself, and sat on the bed.  <a name="C48V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:3</font></a> Jacob said to Joseph, &quot;God
Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
 <a name="C48V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:4</font></a> and said to me, 'Behold,
I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a
company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an
everlasting possession.'  <a name="C48V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:5</font></a> Now your two sons, who were born
to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine;
Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.  <a name="C48V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:6</font></a> Your issue, who you become the
father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of
their brothers in their inheritance.  <a name="C48V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:7</font></a> As for me, when I came from
Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was
still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way
to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).&quot;
<p> <a name="C48V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:8</font></a> Israel saw Joseph's
sons, and said, &quot;Who are these?&quot;
<p> <a name="C48V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:9</font></a> Joseph said to his
father, &quot;They are my sons, whom God has given me here.&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.&quot;
 <a name="C48V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:10</font></a> Now the eyes of Israel
were dim for age, so that he couldn't see. He brought them near to him;
and he kissed them, and embraced them.  <a name="C48V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:11</font></a> Israel said to Joseph, &quot;I
didn't think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your
seed also.&quot;  <a name="C48V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:12</font></a> Joseph
brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his
face to the earth.  <a name="C48V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:13</font></a> Joseph took them both, Ephraim
in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand
toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.  <a name="C48V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:14</font></a> Israel stretched out his right
hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left
hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the
firstborn.  <a name="C48V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:15</font></a> He blessed
Joseph, and said, &quot;The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac
did walk, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,  <a name="C48V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:16</font></a> the angel who has redeemed me
from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the
name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in
the midst of the earth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C48V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:17</font></a> When Joseph saw that
his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.
He held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to
Manasseh's head.  <a name="C48V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:18</font></a> Joseph
said to his father, &quot;Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn;
put your right hand on his head.&quot;
<p> <a name="C48V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:19</font></a> His father refused,
and said, &quot;I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and
he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than
he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.&quot;  <a name="C48V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:20</font></a> He blessed them that day,
saying, &quot;In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim
and as Manasseh'&quot; He set Ephraim before Manasseh.  <a name="C48V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:21</font></a> Israel said to Joseph,
&quot;Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to
the land of your fathers.  <a name="C48V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">48:22</font></a> Moreover I have given to you one
portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite
with my sword and with my bow.&quot;
<p> <a name="C49V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:1</font></a> Jacob called to his
sons, and said: &quot;Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that
which will happen to you in the days to come.

<p> <a name="C49V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:28</font></a> All these are the
twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them and
blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing.  <a name="C49V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:29</font></a> He instructed them, and said to
them, &quot;I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in
the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  <a name="C49V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:30</font></a> in the cave that is in the field
of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.  <a name="C49V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:31</font></a> There they buried Abraham and
Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there
I buried Leah:  <a name="C49V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:32</font></a> the field
and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of
Heth.&quot;  <a name="C49V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">49:33</font></a> When Jacob
made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed,
and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.
<p> <a name="C50V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:1</font></a> Joseph fell on his
father's face, wept on him, and kissed him.  <a name="C50V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:2</font></a> Joseph commanded his servants,
the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
 <a name="C50V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:3</font></a> Forty days were fulfilled
for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians
wept for him for seventy days.
<p> <a name="C50V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:4</font></a> When the days of
weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying,
&quot;If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of
Pharaoh, saying,  <a name="C50V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:5</font></a> 'My
father made me swear, saying, &quot;Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my
grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&quot; Now
therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come
again.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C50V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:6</font></a> Pharaoh said, &quot;Go
up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C50V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:7</font></a> Joseph went up to bury
his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders
of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,  <a name="C50V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:8</font></a> all the house of Joseph, his
brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks,
and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.  <a name="C50V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:9</font></a> There went up with him both
chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.  <a name="C50V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:10</font></a> They came to the threshing floor
of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very
great and sore lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.  <a name="C50V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:11</font></a> When the inhabitants of the
land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said,
&quot;This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.&quot; Therefore, its
name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.  <a name="C50V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:12</font></a> His sons did to him just as he
commanded them,  <a name="C50V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:13</font></a> for his
sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of
the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a
possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
 <a name="C50V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:14</font></a> Joseph returned into
Egypt--he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his
father, after he had buried his father.
<p> <a name="C50V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:15</font></a> When Joseph's
brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &quot;It may be that
Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which
we did to him.&quot;  <a name="C50V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:16</font></a> They sent a message to Joseph,
saying, &quot;Your father commanded before he died, saying,  <a name="C50V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:17</font></a> 'You shall tell Joseph,
&quot;Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin,
because they did evil to you.&quot;' Now, please forgive the disobedience
of the servants of the God of your father.&quot; Joseph wept when they
spoke to him.  <a name="C50V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:18</font></a> His
brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said,
&quot;Behold, we are your servants.&quot;  <a name="C50V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:19</font></a> Joseph said to them, &quot;Don't
be afraid, for am I in the place of God?  <a name="C50V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:20</font></a> As for you, you meant evil
against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this
day, to save many people alive.  <a name="C50V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:21</font></a> Now therefore don't be afraid. I
will nourish you and your little ones.&quot; He comforted them, and spoke
kindly to them.
<p> <a name="C50V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:22</font></a> Joseph lived in
Egypt, he, and his father's house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.
 <a name="C50V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:23</font></a> Joseph saw Ephraim's
children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees.  <a name="C50V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:24</font></a> Joseph said to his brothers,
&quot;I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of
this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob.&quot;  <a name="C50V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:25</font></a> Joseph took
an oath of the children of Israel, saying, &quot;God will surely visit
you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.&quot;  <a name="C50V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">50:26</font></a> So Joseph died, being one
hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin
in Egypt.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Genesis ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web0110h.htm or web0110h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web0111h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web0110ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are<br>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK<br>
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br>
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
