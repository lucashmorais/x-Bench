<h1>
The Good News According to Mark
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The beginning of the Good
News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> As it is written in the prophets,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> The voice of one
crying in the wilderness,
<dd>'Make ready the way of the Lord!
<dd>Make his paths straight!'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> John came <a
href="#N3">baptizing</a> in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
repentance for forgiveness of sins.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> All the country of Judea and all
those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> John was clothed with camel's hair
and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
 <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> He preached, saying,
&quot;After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals
I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> I baptized you <a
href="#N4">in</a> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> It happened in those
days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John
in the Jordan.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Immediately coming up from the
water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a
dove.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> A voice came out of
the sky, &quot;You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Immediately the Spirit
drove him out into the wilderness.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> He was there in the wilderness
forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels
were serving him.
<p> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Now after John was
taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of
the Kingdom of God,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> and
saying, &quot;The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of
God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Passing along by the
sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Jesus said to them, &quot;Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for
men.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Immediately they left
their nets, and followed him.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> Going on a little further from
there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Immediately he called them, and
they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and
went after him.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> They went
into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the
synagogue and taught.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> They were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
 <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> Immediately there was in
their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> saying, &quot;Ha! What do we have
to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know
you who you are: the Holy One of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> Jesus rebuked him,
saying, &quot;Be quiet, and come out of him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> The unclean spirit,
convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> They were all amazed, so that
they questioned among themselves, saying, &quot;What is this? A new
teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and
they obey him!&quot;  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> The
report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of
Galilee and its surrounding area.
<p> <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> Immediately, when they
had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and
Andrew, with James and John.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> Now Simon's wife's mother lay
sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> He came and took her by the hand,
and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.  <a name="C1V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:32</font></a> At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by
demons.  <a name="C1V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:33</font></a> All the city was
gathered together at the door.  <a name="C1V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:34</font></a> He healed many who were sick with
various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to
speak, because they knew him.
<p> <a name="C1V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:35</font></a> Early in the morning,
while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a
deserted place, and prayed there.  <a name="C1V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:36</font></a> Simon and those who were with him
followed after him;  <a name="C1V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:37</font></a> and
they found him, and told him, &quot;Everyone is looking for you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:38</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach
there also, because I came out for this reason.&quot;  <a name="C1V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:39</font></a> He went into their synagogues
throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
<p> <a name="C1V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:40</font></a> A leper came to him,
begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, &quot;If you want
to, you can make me clean.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:41</font></a> Being moved with
compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
&quot;I want to. Be made clean.&quot;  <a name="C1V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:42</font></a> When he had said this,
immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.  <a name="C1V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:43</font></a> He strictly warned him, and
immediately sent him out,  <a name="C1V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:44</font></a> and said to him, &quot;See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to
the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded,
for a testimony to them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:45</font></a> But he went out, and
began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus
could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places:
and they came to him from everywhere.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> When he entered again
into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
 <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Immediately many were
gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the
door; and he spoke the word to them.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Four people came, carrying a
paralytic to him.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> When
they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where
he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the
paralytic was lying on.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Jesus, seeing their faith, said to
the paralytic, &quot;Son, your sins are forgiven
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But there were some of
the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> &quot;Why does this man speak
blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to
them, &quot;Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Which is easier, to tell
the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up
your bed, and walk?'  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> But
that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins&quot;--he said to the paralytic-- <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> &quot;I tell you,
arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> He arose, and
immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that
they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, &quot;We never saw
anything like this!&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> He went out again by
the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> As he passed by, he saw Levi, the
son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot; And he arose and followed him.
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> It happened, that he
was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and
sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and
they followed him.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the
sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, &quot;Why is it that he
eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, &quot;Those who are healthy have no need
for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> John's disciples and
the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, &quot;Why do
John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples don't fast?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with
them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.
 <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> But the days will come
when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast
in that day.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> No one sews
a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and
the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours
out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh
wineskins.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> It happened that he
was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples
began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> The Pharisees said to him,
&quot;Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath
day?&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and
was hungry--he, and those who were with him?  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> How he entered into the house of
God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not
lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with
him?&quot;  <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> He said
to them, &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for
the Sabbath.  <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> Therefore
the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> He entered again into
the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> They watched him, whether
he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> He said to the man who had his
hand withered, &quot;Stand up.&quot;  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm?
To save a life, or to kill?&quot; But they were silent.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> When he had looked around at them
with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the
man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; He
stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.
 <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> The Pharisees went out,
and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might
destroy him.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Jesus withdrew to the
sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee,
from Judea,  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> from
Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and
Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> He spoke to his disciples
that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they
wouldn't press on him.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> For he had healed many, so that
as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> The unclean spirits, whenever
they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, &quot;You are the Son of
God!&quot;  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> He sternly
warned them that they should not make him known.
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> He went up into the
mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to
him.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> He appointed twelve,
that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
 <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> and to have authority to
heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Simon, to whom he gave the name
Peter;  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> James the son of
Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which
means, Sons of Thunder;  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew;
Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
 <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> and Judas Iscariot, who
also betrayed him.
<p>He came into a house.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> The multitude came together
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> When his friends heard it, they
went out to seize him: for they said, &quot;He is insane.&quot;  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> The scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said, &quot;He has Beelzebul,&quot; and, &quot;By the prince of
the demons he casts out the demons.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> He summoned them, and
said to them in parables, &quot;How can Satan cast out
Satan?  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> If a kingdom is
divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> If a house is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> If Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> But no one can enter into the
house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man;
and then he will plunder his house.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, all
sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their
blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> but whoever may blaspheme against
the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal
sin&quot; <a name="C3V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:30</font></a> --because
they said, &quot;He has an unclean spirit.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:31</font></a> His mother and his
brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
 <a name="C3V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:32</font></a> A multitude was sitting
around him, and they told him, &quot;Behold, your mother, your brothers,
and <a href="#N5">your sisters</a> are outside looking for you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:33</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;Who are my mother and my brothers?&quot;
 <a name="C3V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:34</font></a> Looking around at those
who sat around him, he said, &quot;Behold, my mother and
my brothers!  <a name="C3V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:35</font></a> For whoever
does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and
mother.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Again he began to teach
by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered
into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land
by the sea.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> He taught them
many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> &quot;Listen!
Behold, the farmer went out to sow,  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> and it happened, as he sowed, some
seed fell by the road, and the birds<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font> came and devoured it.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Others fell on the rocky ground,
where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no
depth of soil.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> When the
sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered
away.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Others fell among
the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no
fruit.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Others fell into
the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some
brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times
as much.&quot; <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> He
said, &quot;Whoever has ears to hear, let him
hear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> When he was alone,
those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
 <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> He said to them, &quot;To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to
those who are outside, all things are done in parables,  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> that 'seeing they may see, and
not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven
them.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand
all of the parables?  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> The
farmer sows the word.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> The
ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have
heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been
sown in them.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> These in
like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they
have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> They have no root in themselves,
but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the
word, immediately they stumble.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Others are those who are sown
among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> and the cares of this age, and
the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in
choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Those which were sown on the good
ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some
thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Is the lamp brought to be put under a <a
href="#N8">basket</a> or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> For there is nothing hidden,
except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but
that it should come to light.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> If any man has ears to hear, let
him hear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you
measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who
hear.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> For whoever has, to
him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has
will be taken away from him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> He said, &quot;The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the
earth,  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> and should sleep
and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't
know how.  <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> For the earth
bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the
ear.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> But when the fruit
is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has
come.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> He said, &quot;How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable
will we illustrate it?  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> It's like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the
seeds that are on the earth,  <a name="C4V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:32</font></a> yet when it is sown, grows up,
and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so
that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:33</font></a> With many such
parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.  <a name="C4V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:34</font></a> Without a parable he didn't speak
to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
<p> <a name="C4V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:35</font></a> On that day, when
evening had come, he said to them, &quot;Let's go over to
the other side.&quot;  <a name="C4V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:36</font></a> Leaving the multitude, they took
him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also
with him.  <a name="C4V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:37</font></a> A big wind
storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was
already filled.  <a name="C4V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:38</font></a> He
himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and
told him, &quot;Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:39</font></a> He awoke, and rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, &quot;Peace! Be
still!&quot; The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.  <a name="C4V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:40</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no
faith?&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:41</font></a> They were greatly
afraid, and said to one another, &quot;Who then is this, that even the
wind and the sea obey him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> They came to the other
side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> When he had come out of the boat,
immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
 <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> who had his dwelling in
the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> because he had been often bound
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and
the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Always, night and day, in the
tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with
stones.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> When he saw Jesus
from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> and crying out with a loud voice,
he said, &quot;What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High
God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me.&quot;  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> For he said to him, &quot;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> He asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;My name is Legion, for we are many.&quot;  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> He begged him much that he would
not send them away out of the country.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> Now there was on the mountainside
a great herd of pigs feeding.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> All the demons begged him,
saying, &quot;Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> At once Jesus gave
them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs.
The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
and they were drowned in the sea.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Those who fed them fled, and told
it in the city and in the country.
<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> They came to Jesus, and saw him
who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind,
even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Those who saw it declared to them
how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
 <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> They began to beg him to
depart from their region.
<p> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> As he was entering
into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he
might be with him.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> He
didn't allow him, but said to him, &quot;Go to your house,
to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for
you, and how he had mercy on you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> He went his way, and
began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him,
and everyone marveled.
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> When Jesus had crossed
back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to
him; and he was by the sea.  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> Behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
 <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> and begged him much,
saying, &quot;My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> He went with him, and
a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
 <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> A certain woman, who had
an issue of blood for twelve years,  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> and had suffered many things by
many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse,  <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> having
heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and
touched his clothes.  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> For
she said, &quot;If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.&quot;
 <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> Immediately the flow of
her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of
her affliction.
<p> <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around
in the crowd, and asked, &quot;Who touched my
clothes?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> His disciples said to
him, &quot;You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who
touched me?'&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> He looked around to
see her who had done this thing.  <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> But the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before
him, and told him all the truth.
<p> <a name="C5V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:34</font></a> He said to her, &quot;Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and
be cured of your disease.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:35</font></a> While he was still
speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, &quot;Your
daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:36</font></a> But Jesus, when he
heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
&quot;Don't be afraid, only believe.&quot;  <a name="C5V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:37</font></a> He allowed no one to follow him,
except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.  <a name="C5V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:38</font></a> He came to the synagogue ruler's
house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.  <a name="C5V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:39</font></a> When he had entered in, he said
to them, &quot;Why do you make an uproar and weep? The
child is not dead, but is asleep.&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:40</font></a> They ridiculed him.
But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her
mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
 <a name="C5V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:41</font></a> Taking the child by the
hand, he said to her, &quot;Talitha cumi;&quot;
which means, being interpreted, &quot;Girl, I tell you,
get up.&quot;  <a name="C5V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:42</font></a> Immediately the girl rose up, and
walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great
amazement.  <a name="C5V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:43</font></a> He strictly
ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something
should be given to her to eat.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> He went out from there.
He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> When the Sabbath had come, he
began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished,
saying, &quot;Where did this man get these things?&quot; and, &quot;What
is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about
by his hands?  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Isn't this
the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and
Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?&quot; They were offended at him.
<p> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;A prophet is not without honor, except in his own
country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.&quot;
 <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> He could do no mighty work
there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed
them.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> He marveled because
of their unbelief.
<p>He went around the villages teaching.  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> He called to himself the twelve,
and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the
unclean spirits.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> He
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a
staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> but to wear sandals, and not put
on two tunics.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> He said to
them, &quot;Wherever you enter into a house, stay there
until you depart from there.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Whoever will not receive you nor
hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your
feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that
city!&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> They went out and
preached that people should repent.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> They cast out many demons, and
anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> King Herod heard this, for his
name had become known, and he said, &quot;John the Baptizer has risen from
the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.&quot;  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> But others said, &quot;He is
Elijah.&quot; Others said, &quot;He is a prophet, or like one of the
prophets.&quot;  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> But
Herod, when he heard this, said, &quot;This is John, whom I beheaded. He
has risen from the dead.&quot;  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> For Herod himself had sent out
and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> For John said to Herod, &quot;It
is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.&quot;  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Herodias set herself against him,
and desired to kill him, but she couldn't,  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> for Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard
him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
<p> <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> Then a convenient day
came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high
officers, and the chief men of Galilee.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> When the daughter of Herodias
herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him.
The king said to the young lady, &quot;Ask me whatever you want, and I
will give it to you.&quot;  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> He swore to her, &quot;Whatever
you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> She went out, and said
to her mother, &quot;What shall I ask?&quot;
<p>She said, &quot;The head of John the Baptizer.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> She came in
immediately with haste to the king, and asked, &quot;I want you to give me
right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> The king was
exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner
guests, he didn't wish to refuse her.  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> Immediately the king sent out a
soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and
beheaded him in the prison,  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> and brought his head on a
platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her
mother.
<p> <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> When his disciples
heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
<p> <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> The apostles gathered
themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they
had done, and whatever they had taught.  <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> He said to them, &quot;You come apart into a deserted place, and rest
awhile.&quot; For there were many coming and going, and they had no
leisure so much as to eat.  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves.  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> <a href="#N9">They</a> saw them
going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities.
They arrived before them and came together to him.  <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> Jesus came out, saw a great
multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep
without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.  <a name="C6V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:35</font></a> When it was late in the day, his
disciples came to him, and said, &quot;This place is deserted, and it is
late in the day.  <a name="C6V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:36</font></a> Send
them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and
buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:37</font></a> But he answered them,
&quot;You give them something to eat.&quot;
<p>They asked him, &quot;Shall we go and buy <a href="#N10">two hundred
denarii</a> worth of bread, and give them something to eat?&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:38</font></a> He said to them, &quot;How many loaves do you have? Go see.&quot;
<p>When they knew, they said, &quot;Five, and two fish.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:39</font></a> He commanded them that
everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.  <a name="C6V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:40</font></a> They sat down in ranks, by
hundreds and by fifties.  <a name="C6V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:41</font></a> He took the five loaves and the
two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and
he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish
among them all.  <a name="C6V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:42</font></a> They all
ate, and were filled.  <a name="C6V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:43</font></a> They took up twelve baskets full
of broken pieces and also of the fish.  <a name="C6V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:44</font></a> Those who ate the loaves
were<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>
five thousand men.
<p> <a name="C6V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:45</font></a> Immediately he made
his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to
Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.  <a name="C6V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:46</font></a> After he had taken leave of them,
he went up the mountain to pray.
<p> <a name="C6V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:47</font></a> When evening had come,
the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
 <a name="C6V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:48</font></a> Seeing them distressed in
rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the
night he came to them, walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> and he would have passed by
them,  <a name="C6V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:49</font></a> but they, when they
saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
 <a name="C6V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:50</font></a> for they all saw him, and
were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, &quot;Cheer up! <a href="#N13">It is I!</a> Don't be
afraid.&quot;  <a name="C6V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:51</font></a> He
got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very
amazed among themselves, and marveled;  <a name="C6V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:52</font></a> for they hadn't understood about
the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
<p> <a name="C6V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:53</font></a> When they had crossed
over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.  <a name="C6V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:54</font></a> When they had come out of the
boat, immediately the people recognized him,  <a name="C6V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:55</font></a> and ran around that whole region,
and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard
he was.  <a name="C6V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:56</font></a> Wherever he
entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the
sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the <a
href="#N14">fringe</a> of his garment; and as many as touched him were
made well.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Then the Pharisees, and
some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
 <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Now when they saw some of
his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they
found fault.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> (For the
Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they wash their hands and
forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> They don't eat when they come from
the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other
things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers,
bronze vessels, and couches.)  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> The Pharisees and the scribes
asked him, &quot;Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition
of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> He answered them, &quot;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is
written,
<dl>
<dt>'This people honors me with their lips,
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt> <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> But in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> &quot;For you set aside the
commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing
of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.&quot;
 <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you
may keep your tradition.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> For Moses said, 'Honor your
father and your mother;'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N16">*</a></sup></font> and, 'He who speaks evil of father or
mother, let him be put to death.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> But you say, 'If a man tells his
father or his mother, &quot;Whatever profit you might have received from
me is <a href="#N18">Corban</a>, that is to say, given to God;&quot;'
 <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> then you no longer allow
him to do anything for his father or his mother,  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> making void the word of God by
your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like
this.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> He called all the
multitude to himself, and said to them, &quot;Hear me, all
of you, and understand.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> There is nothing from outside of
the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed
out of the man are those that defile the man.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear!&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> When he had entered
into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the
parable.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Are you thus without understanding also? Don't you
perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him,
 <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> because it doesn't go
into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus making
all foods clean?&quot;  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> He said, &quot;That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
 <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> For from within, out of
the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins,
murders, thefts,  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> covetings, wickedness, deceit,
lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> All these evil things come from
within, and defile the man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> From there he arose,
and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house,
and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> For a woman, whose little
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at
his feet.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> Now the woman
was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast
the demon out of her daughter.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> But Jesus said to her, &quot;Let the children be filled first, for it is not
appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the
dogs.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> But she answered him,
&quot;Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's
crumbs.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> He said to her, &quot;For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of
your daughter.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> She went away to her
house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon
gone out.
<p> <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> Again he departed from
the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the region of Decapolis.  <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> They brought to him one who was
deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand
on him.  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> He took him aside
from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he
spat, and touched his tongue.  <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> Looking up to heaven, he sighed,
and said to him, &quot;Ephphatha!&quot; that is,
&quot;Be opened!&quot;  <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> Immediately his ears were opened,
and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
 <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> He commanded them that
they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more
widely they proclaimed it.  <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> They were astonished beyond
measure, saying, &quot;He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf
hear, and the mute speak!&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> In those days, when
there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus
called his disciples to himself, and said to them,  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> &quot;I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> If I send them away fasting to
their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long
way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> His disciples answered
him, &quot;From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a
deserted place?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> He asked them, &quot;How many loaves do you have?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Seven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having
given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and
they served the multitude.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> They had a few small fish. Having
blessed them, he said to serve these also.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> They ate, and were filled. They
took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Those who had eaten were about
four thousand. Then he sent them away.
<p> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Immediately he entered
into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
 <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> The Pharisees came out
and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and
testing him.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> He sighed
deeply in his spirit, and said, &quot;Why does this <a
href="#N19">generation</a> seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign
will be given to this generation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> He left them, and
again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> They forgot to take bread; and
they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> He warned them, saying, &quot;Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the
yeast of Herod.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> They reasoned with one
another, saying, &quot;It's because we have no bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> Jesus, perceiving it,
said to them, &quot;Why do you reason that it's because
you have no bread? Don't you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your
heart still hardened?  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Having eyes, don't you see?
Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember?  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> When I broke the five loaves
among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you
take up?&quot;
<p>They told him, &quot;Twelve.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> &quot;When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many
baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?&quot;
<p>They told him, &quot;Seven.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> He asked them, &quot;Don't you understand, yet?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> He came to Bethsaida.
They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> He took hold of the blind man by
the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his
eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
<p> <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> He looked up, and
said, &quot;I see men; for I see them like trees walking.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> Then again he laid his
hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone
clearly.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> He sent him away
to his house, saying, &quot;Don't enter into the village,
nor tell anyone in the village.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> Jesus went out, with
his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked
his disciples, &quot;Who do men say that I am?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> They told him,
&quot;John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the
prophets.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> He said to them, &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot;
<p>Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> He commanded them that
they should tell no one about him.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> He began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the
chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
again.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> He spoke to them
openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> But he, turning around, and
seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, &quot;Get
behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the
things of men.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> He called the
multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, &quot;Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me.  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> For whoever wants to save his
life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake
of the Good News will save it.  <a name="C8V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:36</font></a> For what does it profit a man, to
gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?  <a name="C8V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:37</font></a> For what will a man give in
exchange for his life?  <a name="C8V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:38</font></a> For whoever will be ashamed of me
and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man
also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here
who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with
power.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> After six days Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high
mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in
front of them.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> His
clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no
launderer on earth can whiten them.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Elijah and Moses appeared to them,
and they were talking with Jesus.
<p> <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Peter answered Jesus,
&quot;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for
you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot;  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> For he didn't know what to say,
for they were very afraid.
<p> <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> A cloud came,
overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &quot;This is my
beloved Son. Listen to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Suddenly looking
around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
<p> <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> As they were coming
down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one
what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the
dead.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> They kept this
saying to themselves, questioning what the &quot;rising from the
dead&quot; meant.
<p> <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> They asked him,
saying, &quot;Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is
it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be
despised?  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> But I tell you
that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted
to, even as it is written about him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Coming to the
disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning
them.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Immediately all the
multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him
greeted him.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> He asked the
scribes, &quot;What are you asking them?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> One of the multitude
answered, &quot;Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
 <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> and wherever it seizes
him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth,
and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't
able.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> He answered him, &quot;Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How
long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> They brought him to
him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he
fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
<p> <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> He asked his father,
&quot;How long has it been since this has come to
him?&quot;
<p>He said, &quot;From childhood.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Often it has cast him both into
the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;If you can believe, all things are possible to him
who believes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> Immediately the father
of the child cried out with tears, &quot;I believe. Help my unbelief!&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> When Jesus saw that a
multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to
him, &quot;You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come
out of him, and never enter him again!&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> Having cried out, and
convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so
much that most of them said, &quot;He is dead.&quot;  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> But Jesus took him by the hand,
and raised him up; and he arose.
<p> <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> When he had come into
the house, his disciples asked him privately, &quot;Why couldn't we cast
it out?&quot;  <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> He said to
them, &quot;This kind can come out by nothing, except by
prayer and fasting.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> They went out from
there, and passed through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it.
 <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> For he was teaching his
disciples, and said to them, &quot;The Son of Man is being
handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is
killed, on the third day he will rise again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> But they didn't
understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
<p> <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> He came to Capernaum,
and when he was in the house he asked them, &quot;What
were you arguing among yourselves on the way?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> But they were silent,
for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the
greatest.
<p> <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> He sat down, and
called the twelve; and he said to them, &quot;If any man
wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of
all.&quot;  <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> He took
a little child, and set him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms,
he said to them,  <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> &quot;Whoever receives one such little child in my name,
receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me, but him who sent
me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> John said to him,
&quot;Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in
your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:39</font></a> But Jesus said, &quot;Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty
work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.  <a name="C9V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:40</font></a> For whoever is not against us is
on our side.  <a name="C9V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:41</font></a> For whoever
will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are
Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
 <a name="C9V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:42</font></a> Whoever will cause one of
these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him
if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
 <a name="C9V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:43</font></a> If your hand causes you
to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed,
rather than having your two hands to go into <a href="#N20">Gehenna,</a>
into the unquenchable fire,  <a name="C9V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:44</font></a> 'where their worm doesn't die,
and the fire is not quenched.'  <a name="C9V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:45</font></a> If your foot causes you to
stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather
than having your two feet to be cast into <a href="#N21">Gehenna,</a> into
the fire that will never be quenched-- <a name="C9V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:46</font></a> 'where their worm doesn't die,
and the fire is not quenched.'  <a name="C9V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:47</font></a> If your eye causes you to
stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of
God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N22">Gehenna</a> of fire,  <a name="C9V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:48</font></a> 'where their worm doesn't die,
and the fire is not quenched.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C9V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:49</font></a> For everyone will be salted with
fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.  <a name="C9V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:50</font></a> Salt is good, but if the salt has
lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves,
and be at peace with one another.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> He arose from there
and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came
together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
 <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Pharisees came to him
testing him, and asked him, &quot;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
wife?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> He answered, &quot;What did Moses command you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> They said, &quot;Moses
allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> But Jesus said to
them, &quot;For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this
commandment.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> But from the
beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N24">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> For this cause a man will leave
his father and mother, and will join to his wife,  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> and the two will become one
flesh,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N25">*</a></sup></font>
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> What therefore God has joined
together, let no man separate.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> In the house, his
disciples asked him again about the same matter.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits
adultery against her.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> If
a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits
adultery.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> They were bringing to
him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked
those who were bringing them.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> But when Jesus saw it, he was
moved with indignation, and said to them, &quot;Allow the
little children to come to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God
belongs to such as these.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Most certainly I tell you,
whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.&quot;  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> He took them in his arms, and
blessed them, laying his hands on them.
<p> <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> As he was going out
into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, &quot;Good
Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Why do you call me good? No one is good except
one--God.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> You know the
commandments: 'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,'
'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and
mother.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> Jesus looking at him
loved him, and said to him, &quot;One thing you lack. Go,
sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> But his face fell at
that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great
possessions.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> Jesus
looked around, and said to his disciples, &quot;How
difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of
God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> The disciples were
amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, &quot;Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to
enter into the Kingdom of God!  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> It is easier for a camel to go
through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> They were exceedingly
astonished, saying to him, &quot;Then who can be saved?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> Jesus, looking at
them, said, &quot;With men it is impossible, but not with
God, for all things are possible with God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Peter began to tell
him, &quot;Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> but he will receive one hundred
times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children,
and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> But many who are first will be
last; and the last first.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> They were on the way,
going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were
amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and
began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> &quot;Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief
priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver
him to the Gentiles.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> They will mock him, spit on him,
scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise
again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, &quot;Teacher, we want you to
do for us whatever we will ask.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your
left hand, in your glory.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> But Jesus said to
them, &quot;You don't know what you are asking. Are you
able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;We are able.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;You shall indeed drink the
cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with;  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> but to
sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom
it has been prepared.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> When the ten heard
it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.
<p> <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> Jesus summoned them,
and said to them, &quot;You know that they who are
recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great
ones exercise authority over them.  <a name="C10V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:43</font></a> But it shall not be so among
you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
 <a name="C10V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:44</font></a> Whoever of you wants to
become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.  <a name="C10V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:45</font></a> For the Son of Man also came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:46</font></a> They came to Jericho.
As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the
son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
 <a name="C10V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:47</font></a> When he heard that it
was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, &quot;Jesus, you son
of David, have mercy on me!&quot;  <a name="C10V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:48</font></a> Many rebuked him, that he should
be quiet, but he cried out much more, &quot;You son of David, have mercy
on me!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:49</font></a> Jesus stood still,
and said, &quot;Call him.&quot;
<p>They called the blind man, saying to him, &quot;Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:50</font></a> He, casting away his
cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
<p> <a name="C10V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:51</font></a> Jesus asked him,
&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot;
<p>The blind man said to him, &quot;<a href="#N27">Rhabboni,</a> that I
may see again.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:52</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Go your way. Your faith has made you
well.&quot; Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus
in the way.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> When they drew near to
Jerusalem, to <a href="#N28">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples,  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> and said to them, &quot;Go your way into the village that is opposite you.
Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on
which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> If anyone asks you, 'Why are you
doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him
back here.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> They went away, and
found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they
untied him.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> Some of those
who stood there asked them, &quot;What are you doing, untying the young
donkey?&quot;  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> They said
to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
<p> <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> They brought the young
donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.
 <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> Many spread their
garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees,
and spreading them on the road.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Those who went in front, and
those who followed, cried out, &quot;<a href="#N29">Hosanna</a>! Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N30">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Blessed is the kingdom of our
father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the
highest!&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Jesus entered into
the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being
now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
<p> <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> The next day, when
they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Seeing a fig tree afar off
having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it.
When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season
for figs.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Jesus told it,
&quot;May no one ever eat fruit from you
again!&quot; and his disciples heard it.
<p> <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> They came to
Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those
who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of
the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> He would not allow anyone to
carry a container through the temple.  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> He taught, saying to them, &quot;Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of
prayer for all the nations?'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N31">*</a></sup></font> But you have made it a den of
robbers!&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N32">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> The chief priests and
the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they
feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
<p> <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> When evening came, he
went out of the city.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> As
they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from
the roots.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Peter,
remembering, said to him, &quot;Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed
has withered away.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Have faith in God.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> For most certainly I tell you,
whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and
doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening;
he shall have whatever he says.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> Therefore I tell you, all things
whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and
you shall have them.  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> Whenever you stand praying,
forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is
in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> But if you do not forgive,
neither will your Father in heaven forgive your
transgressions.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> They came again to
Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the
scribes, and the elders came to him,  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> and they began saying to him,
&quot;By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this
authority to do these things?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will
tell you by what authority I do these things.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> The baptism of John--was it from
heaven, or from men? Answer me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> They reasoned with
themselves, saying, &quot;If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say,
'Why then did you not believe him?'  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> If we should say, 'From
men'&quot;--they feared the people, for all held John to really be a
prophet.  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> They answered
Jesus, &quot;We don't know.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;Neither do I tell you by what
authority I do these things.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> He began to speak to
them in parables. &quot;A man planted a vineyard, put a
hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out
to a farmer, and went into another country.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> When it was time, he sent a
servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the
vineyard.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> They took him,
beat him, and sent him away empty.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Again, he sent another servant to
them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him
away shamefully treated.  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Again he sent another; and they
killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Therefore still having one, his
beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
 <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> But those farmers said
among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.'  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> They took him, killed him, and
cast him out of the vineyard.  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> What therefore will the lord of
the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> Haven't you even read this
Scripture:
<dl>
<dt>'The stone which the builders rejected,
<dd>the same was made the head of the corner.
<dt> <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> This was from the
Lord,
<dd>it is marvelous in our eyes'?&quot;
</dl><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N33">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> They tried to seize
him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the
parable against them. They left him, and went away.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> They sent some of the Pharisees
and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> When they had come, they asked
him, &quot;Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to
anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Shall we give, or shall we not
give?&quot;
<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, &quot;Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see
it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> They brought it.
<p>He said to them, &quot;Whose is this image and
inscription?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;Caesar's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and
to God the things that are God's.&quot;
<p>They marveled greatly at him.
<p> <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> There came to him
Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
 <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> &quot;Teacher, Moses
wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and
leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
offspring for his brother.'  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> There were seven brothers. The
first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> The second took her, and died,
leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> and the seven took her and left
no children. Last of all the woman also died.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> In the resurrection, when they
rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a
wife.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God?  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> For when they will rise from the
dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
in heaven.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> But about the
dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about
the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N34">*</a></sup></font>?  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> One of the scribes
came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered
them well, asked him, &quot;Which commandment is the greatest of all?&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is one:  <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind, and with all your strength.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N35">*</a></sup></font> This is the first
commandment.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> The second
is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N36">*</a></sup></font> There is no
other commandment greater than these.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> The scribe said to
him, &quot;Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is
none other but he,  <a name="C12V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:33</font></a> and
to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all
the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself,
is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> When Jesus saw that
he answered wisely, he said to him, &quot;You are not far
from the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p>No one dared ask him any question after that.  <a name="C12V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:35</font></a> Jesus responded, as he taught in
the temple, &quot;How is it that the scribes say that the
Christ is the son of David?  <a name="C12V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:36</font></a> For David himself said in the
Holy Spirit,
<dl>
<dt>'The Lord said to my Lord,
<dd>&quot;Sit at my right hand,
<dd>until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.&quot;'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N37">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> Therefore David himself calls
him Lord, so how can he be his son?&quot;
<p>The common people heard him gladly.  <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> In his teaching he said to them,
&quot;Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long
robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,  <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> and the best seats in the
synagogues, and the best places at feasts:  <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> those who devour widows' houses,
and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> Jesus sat down
opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the
treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.  <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> A poor widow came, and she cast
in two <a href="#N38">small brass coins,</a> which equal a <a
href="#N39">quadrans coin.</a>  <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> He called his disciples to
himself, and said to them, &quot;Most certainly I tell
you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the
treasury,  <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> for they all
gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that
she had to live on.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> As he went out of the
temple, one of his disciples said to him, &quot;Teacher, see what kind of
stones and what kind of buildings!&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Do you see these great buildings? There will not be
left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> As he sat on the Mount
of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him
privately,  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> &quot;Tell us,
when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all
about to be fulfilled?&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Jesus, answering,
began to tell them, &quot;Be careful that no one leads you
astray.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> For many will
come in my name, saying, '<a href="#N40">I am he!</a>' and will lead many
astray.
<p> <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> &quot;When you hear of wars and
rumors of wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is
not yet.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> For nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These
things are the beginning of birth pains.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> But watch yourselves, for they
will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
 <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> The Good News must first
be preached to all the nations.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> When they lead you away and
deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will
say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you
who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
<p> <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> &quot;Brother will deliver up
brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against
parents, and cause them to be put to death.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> You will be hated by all men for
my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
 <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> But when you see the
abomination of desolation,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N41">*</a></sup></font> spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing
where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in
Judea flee to the mountains,  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> and let him who is on the
housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.
 <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Let him who is in the
field not return back to take his cloak.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> But woe to those who are with
child and to those who nurse babies in those days!  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> Pray that your flight won't be
in the winter.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> For in
those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like
from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never
will be.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> Unless the Lord
had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake
of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> Then if anyone tells you, 'Look,
here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> For there will arise false
christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may
lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> But you watch.
<p>&quot;Behold, I have told you all things
beforehand.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> But in those
days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not
give its light,  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> the
stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens
will be shaken.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N42">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> Then they will see the Son of
Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> Then he will send out his
angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from
the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.
<p> <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> &quot;Now from the fig tree,
learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth
its leaves, you know that the summer is near;  <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> even so you also, when you see
these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Most certainly I say to you,
this <a href="#N43">generation</a> will not pass away until all these
things happen.  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> But of that day or that hour no
one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> Watch, keep
alert, and pray; for you don't know when the time is.
<p> <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> &quot;It is like a man,
traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority
to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the
doorkeeper to keep watch.  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> Watch therefore, for you don't
know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at
midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;  <a name="C13V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:36</font></a> lest coming suddenly he might
find you sleeping.  <a name="C13V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:37</font></a> What
I tell you, I tell all: Watch.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> It was now two days
before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief
priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and
kill him.  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> For they said,
&quot;Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the
people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> While he was at
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman
came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She
broke the jar, and poured it over his head.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> But there were some who were
indignant among themselves, saying, &quot;Why has this ointment been
wasted?  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> For this might
have been sold for more than <a href="#N44">three hundred denarii,</a> and
given to the poor.&quot; They grumbled against her.
<p> <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> But Jesus said, &quot;Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a
good work for me.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> For you
always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them
good; but you will not always have me.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> She has done what she could. She
has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that
which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of
her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Judas Iscariot, who
was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might
deliver him to them.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> They, when they heard it, were
glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently
deliver him.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> On the
first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his
disciples asked him, &quot;Where do you want us to go and make ready that
you may eat the Passover?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> He sent two of his
disciples, and said to them, &quot;Go into the city, and
there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> and wherever he enters in, tell
the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, &quot;Where is the guest room,
where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&quot;'  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> He will himself show you a large
upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> His disciples went
out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and
they prepared the Passover.
<p> <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> When it was evening
he came with the twelve.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> As they sat and were eating,
Jesus said, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, one of you
will betray me--he who eats with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> They began to be
sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, &quot;Surely not I?&quot; And
another said, &quot;Surely not I?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the
dish.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> For the Son of Man
goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son
of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been
born.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them,
and said, &quot;Take, eat. This is my body.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> He took the cup, and
when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> He said to them, &quot;This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out
for many.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> Most certainly
I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day
when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God.&quot;  <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p> <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;All of you will be made to stumble because of me
tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
will be scattered.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> However, after I am raised up, I
will go before you into Galilee.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> But Peter said to
him, &quot;Although all will be offended, yet I will not.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this
night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> But he spoke all the
more, &quot;If I must die with you, I will not deny you.&quot; They all
said the same thing.
<p> <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> They came to a place
which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, &quot;Sit here, while I pray.&quot;  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> He took with him Peter, James,
and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.  <a name="C14V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:34</font></a> He said to them, &quot;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay
here, and watch.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:35</font></a> He went forward a
little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the
hour might pass away from him.  <a name="C14V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:36</font></a> He said, &quot;Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please
remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you
desire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:37</font></a> He came and found
them sleeping, and said to Peter, &quot;Simon, are you
sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour?  <a name="C14V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:38</font></a> Watch and pray, that you may not
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:39</font></a> Again he went away,
and prayed, saying the same words.  <a name="C14V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:40</font></a> Again he returned, and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what
to answer him.  <a name="C14V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:41</font></a> He came
the third time, and said to them, &quot;Sleep on now, and
take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <a name="C14V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:42</font></a> Arise, let us be going. Behold,
he who betrays me is at hand.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:43</font></a> Immediately, while he
was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and
the elders.  <a name="C14V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:44</font></a> Now he who
betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, &quot;Whoever I will kiss,
that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.&quot;  <a name="C14V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:45</font></a> When he had come, immediately he
came to him, and said, &quot;Rabbi! Rabbi!&quot; and kissed him.  <a name="C14V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:46</font></a> They laid their hands on him,
and seized him.  <a name="C14V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:47</font></a> But a
certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<p> <a name="C14V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:48</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords
and clubs to seize me?  <a name="C14V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:49</font></a> I
was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But
this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:50</font></a> They all left him,
and fled.  <a name="C14V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:51</font></a> A certain
young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over
his naked body. The young men grabbed him,  <a name="C14V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:52</font></a> but he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked.  <a name="C14V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:53</font></a> They led Jesus away to the high
priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together
with him.
<p> <a name="C14V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:54</font></a> Peter had followed
him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He
was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the
fire.  <a name="C14V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:55</font></a> Now the chief
priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to
death, and found none.  <a name="C14V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:56</font></a> For many gave false testimony
against him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other.  <a name="C14V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:57</font></a> Some stood up, and gave false
testimony against him, saying,  <a name="C14V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:58</font></a> &quot;We heard him say, 'I will
destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will
build another made without hands.'&quot;  <a name="C14V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:59</font></a> Even so, their testimony did not
agree.
<p> <a name="C14V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:60</font></a> The high priest stood
up in the midst, and asked Jesus, &quot;Have you no answer? What is it
which these testify against you?&quot;  <a name="C14V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:61</font></a> But he stayed quiet, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, &quot;Are you the
Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:62</font></a> Jesus said, &quot;I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right
hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:63</font></a> The high priest tore
his clothes, and said, &quot;What further need have we of witnesses?
 <a name="C14V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:64</font></a> You have heard the
blasphemy! What do you think?&quot; They all condemned him to be worthy of
death.  <a name="C14V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:65</font></a> Some began to
spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to
tell him, &quot;Prophesy!&quot; The officers struck him with the palms of
their hands.
<p> <a name="C14V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:66</font></a> As Peter was in the
courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,  <a name="C14V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:67</font></a> and seeing Peter warming
himself, she looked at him, and said, &quot;You were also with the
Nazarene, Jesus!&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:68</font></a> But he denied it,
saying, &quot;I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.&quot; He
went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
<p> <a name="C14V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:69</font></a> The maid saw him, and
began again to tell those who stood by, &quot;This is one of them.&quot;
 <a name="C14V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:70</font></a> But he again denied it.
After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, &quot;You
truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows
it.&quot;  <a name="C14V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:71</font></a> But he began
to curse, and to swear, &quot;I don't know this man of whom you
speak!&quot;  <a name="C14V72"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:72</font></a> The rooster
crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to
him, &quot;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny
me three times.&quot; When he thought about that, he wept.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Immediately in the
morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole
council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and
delivered him up to Pilate.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Pilate asked him, &quot;Are you
the King of the Jews?&quot;
<p>He answered, &quot;So you say.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> The chief priests
accused him of many things.  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> Pilate again asked him,
&quot;Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against
you!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> But Jesus made no
further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
<p> <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Now at the feast he
used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> There was one called Barabbas,
bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection
had committed murder.  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> The
multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
 <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> Pilate answered them,
saying, &quot;Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&quot;
 <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> For he perceived that
for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> But the chief priests stirred up
the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> Pilate again asked them,
&quot;What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the
Jews?&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> They cried out again,
&quot;Crucify him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> Pilate said to them,
&quot;Why, what evil has he done?&quot;
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> Pilate, wishing to
please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus,
when he had flogged him, to be crucified.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> The soldiers led him away within
the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> They clothed him
with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> They began to salute him,
&quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot;  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> They struck his head with a
reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> When they had mocked him, they
took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him
out to crucify him.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> They
compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the
father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his
cross.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> They brought him
to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, &quot;The place
of a skull.&quot;  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> They
offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it.
<p> <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Crucifying him, they
parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should
take.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> It was <a
href="#N46">the third hour,</a> and they crucified him.  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> The superscription of his
accusation was written over him, &quot;THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> With him they crucified two
robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> The Scripture was fulfilled,
which says, &quot;He was numbered with transgressors.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, &quot;Ha! You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days,  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> save yourself, and come down
from the cross!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> Likewise, also the
chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, &quot;He
saved others. He can't save himself.  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> Let the Christ, the King of
Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe <a
href="#N47">him.</a>&quot; Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
<p> <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> When the <a
href="#N48">sixth hour</a> had come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the <a href="#N49">ninth hour.</a>  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> At the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?&quot; which is, being interpreted, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N50">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> Some of those who
stood by, when they heard it, said, &quot;Behold, he is calling
Elijah.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> One ran, and filling
a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink,
saying, &quot;Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him
down.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> Jesus cried out with
a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.  <a name="C15V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:38</font></a> The veil of the temple was torn
in two from the top to the bottom.  <a name="C15V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:39</font></a> When the centurion, who stood by
opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he
said, &quot;Truly this man was the Son of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:40</font></a> There were also women
watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  <a name="C15V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:41</font></a> who, when he was in Galilee,
followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.
<p> <a name="C15V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:42</font></a> When evening had now
come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the
Sabbath,  <a name="C15V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:43</font></a> Joseph of
Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for
the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus' body.  <a name="C15V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:44</font></a> Pilate
marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked
him whether he had been dead long.  <a name="C15V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:45</font></a> When he found out from the
centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.  <a name="C15V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:46</font></a> He bought a linen cloth, and
taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb
which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of
the tomb.  <a name="C15V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:47</font></a> Mary Magdalene
and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> When the Sabbath was
past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
spices, that they might come and anoint him.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> Very early on the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> They were saying among
themselves, &quot;Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb
for us?&quot;  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> for it was
very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
<p> <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> Entering into the
tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white
robe, and they were amazed.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Don't be
amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has
risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> But go, tell his disciples and
Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he
said to you.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> They went out,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N51">*</a></sup></font> and fled
from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said
nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Now when he had risen early on
the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom
he had cast out seven demons.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> She went and told those who had
been with him, as they mourned and wept.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> When they heard that he was
alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.  <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> After these things he was
revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into
the country.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> They went
away and told it to the rest. They didn't believe them, either.
<p> <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Afterward he was
revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe
those who had seen him after he had risen.  <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the
whole creation.  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> He who
believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be
condemned.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> These signs
will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons;
they will speak with new languages;  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> they will take up serpents; and
if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay
hands on the sick, and they will recover.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> So then the Lord
Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat
down at the right hand of God.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> They went out, and preached
everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the
signs that followed. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,<br>
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,<br>

Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>
Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>


<p>Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment<br>
method other than by check or money order.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by<br>
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be<br>
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
