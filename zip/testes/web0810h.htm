<h1>
Ruth
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> It happened in the days
when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. A certain man
of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his
wife, and his two sons.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> The name of the man was Elimelech,
and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and
Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of
Moab, and continued there.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died;
and she was left, and her two sons.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> They took them wives of the women
of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth:
and they lived there about ten years.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Mahlon and Chilion died both of
them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Then she arose with her
daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she
had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in
giving them bread.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> She
went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law
with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Naomi said to her two
daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: Yahweh
deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
 <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Yahweh grant you that you
may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed
them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> They said to her, No, but we will
return with you to your people.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Naomi said, Turn again, my
daughters: why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they
may be your husbands?  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Turn again, my daughters, go your
way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if
I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> would you therefore wait until
they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my
daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh
is gone forth against me.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> They lifted up their voice, and
wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> She said, Behold, your
sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god: return you after
your sister-in-law.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Ruth
said, &quot;Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following
after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge;
your people shall be my people, and your God my God;  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> where you die, will I die, and
there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but
death part you and me.&quot;  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> When she saw that she was
steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> So they two went until they came
to Bethlehem. It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the
city was moved about them, and <I>the women</I> said, Is this Naomi?
 <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> She said to them,
&quot;Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very
bitterly with me.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> I went
out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me
Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has
afflicted me?&quot;  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> So
Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who
returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the
beginning of barley harvest.
<p>  <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Naomi had a kinsman of
her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his
name was Boaz.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Ruth the
Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the
ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. She said to
her, Go, my daughter.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> She
went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she
happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of
the family of Elimelech.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem,
and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you. They answered him, Yahweh
bless you.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Then said Boaz
to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?
 <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The servant who was set
over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi
out of the country of Moab:  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> She said, Please let me glean and
gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued
even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the
house.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Then said Boaz to
Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field,
neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Let your eyes be on the field that
they reap, and go after them: haven't I commanded the young men not to
touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that
which the young men have drawn.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Then she fell on her face, and
bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in
your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
 <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Boaz answered her, It has
fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since
the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your
mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you
didn't know before.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Yahweh recompense your work, and
a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings
you are come to take refuge.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Then she said, Let me find favor
in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you
have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your
handmaidens.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> At meal time
Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in
the vinegar. She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched
grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> When she was risen up to glean,
Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the
sheaves, and don't reproach her.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Also pull out some for her from
the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
 <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> So she gleaned in the
field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was
about an ephah of barley.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> She took it up, and went into the
city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought
forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
 <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Her mother-in-law said to
her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be
he who did take knowledge of you. She showed her mother-in-law with whom
she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
 <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Naomi said to her
daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his
kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a
close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he
said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all
my harvest.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Naomi said to
Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with
his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> So she kept fast by the maidens
of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and
she lived with her mother-in-law.
<p>  <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Naomi her
mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you,
that it may be well with you?  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with
whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing
floor.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Wash yourself
therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down
to the threshing floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he
shall have done eating and drinking.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> It shall be, when he lies down,
that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and
uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall
do.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> She said to her, All
that you say I will do.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> She went down to the threshing
floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and
his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain:
and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> It happened at midnight, that the
man was afraid, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> He said, Who are you? She
answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your
handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> He said, Blessed are you by
Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than
at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or
rich.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Now, my daughter,
don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my
people does know that you are a worthy woman.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Now it is true that I am a near
kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Stay this night, and it shall be
in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman,
well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh
lives: lie down until the morning.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> She lay at his feet until the
morning. She rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it
not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> He said, Bring the mantle that is
on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six <I>measures</I>
of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> When she came to her
mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? She told her all that
the man had done to her.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> She said, These six
<I>measures</I> of barley gave he me; for he said, &quot;Don't go empty to
your mother-in-law.&quot;  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Then said she, &quot;Sit still,
my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not
rest, until he has finished the thing this day.&quot;
<p>  <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Now Boaz went up to
the gate, and sat him down there: and behold, the near kinsman of whom
Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down
here. He turned aside, and sat down.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> He took ten men of the elders of
the city, and said, Sit you down here. They sat down.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> He said to the near kinsman,
Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel
of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> I thought to disclose it to you,
saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my
people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it,
then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you;
and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Then said Boaz, What day you buy
the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the
Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his
inheritance.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> The near
kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance:
take my right of redemption on you; for I can't redeem it.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Now this was <I>the custom</I> in
former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to
confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor;
and this was the <I>manner of</I> attestation in Israel.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> So the near kinsman said to Boaz,
Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Boaz said to the elders, and to
all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that
was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of
Naomi.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Moreover Ruth the
Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up
the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be
cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are
witnesses this day.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> All
the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.
Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like
Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in
Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> and let your house be like the
house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall
give you of this young woman.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> So Boaz took Ruth, and she became
his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she
bore a son.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> The women
said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a
near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> He shall be to you a restorer of
life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves
you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> Naomi took the child, and laid it
in her bosom, and became nurse to it.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> The women her neighbors gave it a
name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is
the father of Jesse, the father of David.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Now this is the history of the
generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> and Hezron became the father of
Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> and Amminadab became the father
of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> and Salmon became the father of
Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> and Obed became the father of
Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>
Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>


<p>Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment<br>
method other than by check or money order.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by<br>
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be<br>
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
