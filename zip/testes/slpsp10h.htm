<P>
  <HR width="10%">
<P>
Homer, in all probability, knew no rules of rhetoric, and was not tortured
with the consideration of grammatical construction, and yet his verse will
endure through time. If everybody possessed the genius of Homer, rules and
cautions in writing would be unnecessary.
<P>
To-day all men speak, and most men write, but it is observed that those who
most closely follow Homer's method of writing without rules are most unlike
Homer in the results. The ancient bard was a law unto himself; we need rules
for our guidance.
<P>
Rules of writing are the outgrowth of the study of the characteristics and
qualities of style which distinguish the best writers from those of inferior
skill and ability. Grammarians and rhetoricians, according to their several
lines of investigation, set forth the laws and principles governing speech,
and formulate rules whereby we may follow the true, and avoid the false.
<P>
Grammar and rhetoric, as too often presented in the schools, are such uninviting
studies that when
<P>
  <HR>
4
<P align=justify class=full>
school-days are ended, the books are laid aside, and are rarely consulted
afterward. The custom of formally burning the text-books after the final
examinations&#8212; a custom that prevails in some institutions&#8212; is but an emphatic
method of showing how the students regard the subjects treated in the books.
<P>
If all the rules and principles had been thoroughly mastered, the huge bonfire
of text-books in grammar and rhetoric might be regarded a fitting celebration
of the students' victory over the difficulties of "English undefiled." But
too often these rules are merely memorized by the student for the purpose
of recitation, and are not engrafted upon his everyday habit of speech. They
are, therefore, soon forgotten, and the principles involved are subject to
daily violation.
<P>
Hence arises the need of books like SLIPS OF SPEECH, in which the common
faults of speakers and writers are pointed out, and the correct use of words
shown. Brief and informal in treatment, they will be read and consulted when
the more voluminous text-books will be left untouched.
<P>
The copious index appended to this volume will afford a ready reference to
the many subjects discussed, and will contribute greatly to the convenience
and permanent value of the book.

<blockquote>
"We should be as careful of our words as of our
  actions."&#8212; CICERO.</blockquote

    <HR width="10%">
<h3>  CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>  <B>Taste</B></h4>
<P>
Taste is a universal gift. It has been found in some degree in all nations,
races, and ages. It is shown by the savage in his love of personal decoration;
by the civilized man in his love of art.
<P>
But while it is thus universal, it is as different among men as their faces,
complexions, characters, or languages. Even among people of the same nation,
it is as different as the degrees of society. The same individual at different
periods of life, shows this variableness of taste.
<P>
These diversities of taste imply a susceptibility to improvement. Good taste
in writing forms no exception to the rule. While it seems to require some
basis in nature, no degree of inborn aptitude will compensate for the lack
of careful training.
<P>
To give his natural taste firmness and fineness a writer needs to read the
best literature, not merely so
<P>
  <HR>
8
<P align=justify class=full>
as to know it, but so as to feel the beauty, the fitness, the charm, the
strength, the delicacy of a well-chosen word.
<P>
The study of the proper arrangement and the most effective expression of
our thoughts prompts us to think more accurately. So close is the connection
between the thought and its expression that looseness of style in speaking
and writing may nearly always be traced to indistinctness and feebleness
in the grasp of the subject. No degree of polish in expression will compensate
for inadequacy of knowledge. But with the fullest information upon any subject,
there is still room for the highest exercise of judgment and good sense in
the proper choice and arrangement of the thoughts, and of the words with
which to express them.
<P>
The concurrent testimony of those best qualified to render a decision, has
determined what authors reflect the finest literary taste, and these writers
should be carefully studied by all who aspire to elegance, accuracy, and
strength in literary expression.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Fine Writing</B>

<P>
Never hesitate to call a spade a <I>spade.</I> One of the most frequent
violations of good taste consists in the effort to dress a common subject
in high-sounding language. The ass in the fable showed his stupidity
<P>
  <HR>
9
<P align=justify class=full>
when he put on the lion's skin and expected the other animals to declare
him to be the king of beasts. The distinction of a subject lies in its own
inherent character, and no pompous parade of words will serve to exalt a
commonplace theme.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Poetic Terms</B>

<P>
In the expression of homely ideas and the discussion of affairs of every-day
life, avoid such poetic forms as <I>o'er</I> for over, <I>ne'er </I>for never,
<I>'mid</I> for amid, <I>e'en</I> for even, <I>'gan</I> for began,
<I>'twixt</I> for betwixt, <I>'neath</I> for beneath, <I>list</I> for listen,
<I>oft</I> for often, <I>morn</I> for morning, <I>eve</I> for evening,
<I>e'er</I> for ever, <I>ere</I> for before, <I>'tis</I> for it is, <I>'twas
</I>for it was.
<P>
In all prose composition, avoid such poetic forms as <I>swain, wight, mead,
brake, dingle, dell, zephyr.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Foreign Words</B>

<P>
The unrestrained use of foreign words, whether from the ancient or from the
modern languages, savors of pedantry and affectation. The ripest scholars,
in speaking and writing English, make least use of foreign words or phrases.
Persons who indulge in their use incur the risk of being charged with a desire
to exhibit their linguistic attainments.
<P>
On the other hand, occasions arise when the use of words from a foreign tongue
by one who is thoroughly
<P>
  <HR>
10
<P align=justify class=full>
familiar with them, will add both grace and exactness to his style.
<P>
Rarely use a foreign term when your meaning can be as well expressed in English.
Instead of <I>blase,</I> use surfeited, or wearied; for <I>cortege </I>use
procession for <I>couleur de rose,</I> rose-color; for <I>dejeuner,
</I>breakfast; for <I>employe,</I> employee; for <I>en route,</I> on the
way; for <I>entre nous,</I> between ourselves; for <I>fait accompli,</I>
an accomplished fact; for <I>in toto,</I> wholly, entirely; for <I>penchant,
</I>inclination; for <I>raison d'etre,</I> reason for existence; for
<I>recherche,</I> choice, refined; for <I>role,</I> part; for <I>soiree
dansante,</I> an evening dancing party; for <I>sub rosa,</I> secretly, etc.
<P>
The following incident from the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> is in point:
<P>
The gentleman from the West pulled his chair up to the hotel table, tucked
his napkin under his chin, picked up the bill-of-fare and began to study
it intently. Everything was in restaurant French, and he didn't like it.
<P>
"Here, waiter," he said, sternly, "there's nothing on this I want."
<P>
"Ain't there nothin' else you would like for dinner, sir?" inquired the waiter,
politely.
<P>
"Have you got any <I>sine qua non?"</I>
<P>
The waiter gasped.
<P>
"No, sir," he replied.
<P>
  <HR>
11
<P>
"Got any <I>bon mots?"</I>
<P>
"N&#8212; no, sir."
<P>
"Got any <I>semper idem?"</I>
<P>
"No, sir, we hain't."
<P>
"Got any <I>jeu d'esprits?"</I>
<P>
"No, sir; not a one."
<P>
"Got any <I>tempus fugit?"</I>
<P>
"I reckon not, sir."
<P>
"Got any <I>soiree dansante?"</I>
<P>
"No, sir."
<P>
The waiter was edging off.
<P>
"Got any <I>sine die?"</I>
<P>
"We hain't, sir."
<P>
"Got any <I>e pluribus unum?"</I>
<P>
The waiter's face showed some sign of intelligence.
<P>
"Seems like I heard ob dat, sir," and he rushed out to the kitchen, only
to return empty-handed.
<P>
"We ain't got none, sir," he said, in a tone of disappointment.
<P>
"Got any <I>mal de mer?"</I>
<P>
"N&#8212; no, sir."
<P>
The waiter was going to pieces fast.
<P>
The gentleman from the West, was as serene as a May morning.
<P>
"Got any <I>vice versa?"</I> he inquired again.
<P>
The waiter could only shake his head.
<P>
  <HR>
12
<P>
"No? Well, maybe you've got some bacon and cabbage, and a corn dodger?"
<P>
"'Deed we have, sir," exclaimed the waiter, in a tone of the utmost relief,
and he fairly flew out to the kitchen.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Trite Expressions</B>

<P>
Words and phrases which may once have been striking and effective, or witty
and felicitous, but which have become worn out by oft-repeated use, should
be avoided. The following hackneyed phrases will serve to illustrate: "The
staff of life," "gave up the ship," "counterfeit presentment," "the hymeneal
altar," "bold as a lion," "throw cold water upon," "the rose upon the cheek,"
"lords of creation," "the weaker sex," "the better half," "the rising
generation," "tripping the light fantastic toe," "the cup that cheers but
does not inebriate," "in the arms of Morpheus," "the debt of nature," "the
bourne whence no traveler returns," "to shuffle off this mortal coil," "the
devouring element," "a brow of alabaster."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Pet Words</B>

<P>
Avoid pet words, whether individual, provincial, or national in their use.
Few persons are entirely free from the overuse of certain words. Young people
largely employ such words as <I>delightful, delicious,</I>
<P>
  <HR>
13
<P align=justify class=full>
<I>exquisite,</I> and other expressive adjectives, which constitute a kind
of society slang.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Overworked Expressions</B>

<P>
Words and phrases are often taken up by writers and speakers, repeated, and
again taken up by others, and thus their use enlarges in ever-widening circles
until the expressions become threadbare. Drop them before they have reached
that state. <I>Function, environment, trend, the masses, to be in touch with,
to voice the sentiments of&#8212; </I>these are enough to illustrate the kind of
words referred to.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Very Vulgar Vulgarisms</B>

<P>
No one who has any regard for purity of diction and the proprieties of cultivated
society will be guilty of the use of such expressions as <I>yaller</I> for
yellow, <I>feller</I> for fellow, <I>kittle</I> for kettle, <I>kiver</I>
for cover, <I>ingons</I> for onions, <I>cowcumbers</I> for cucumbers,
<I>sparrowgrass</I> for asparagus, <I>yarbs</I> for herbs, <I>taters </I>for
potatoes, <I>tomats</I> for tomatoes, <I>bile</I> for boil, <I>hain't </I>for
ain't or isn't, <I>het</I> for heated, <I>kned</I> for kneaded, <I>sot</I>
for sat or set, <I>teeny</I> for tiny, <I>fooling you</I> for deceiving you,
<I>them</I> for those, <I>shut up</I> for be quiet, or be still, or cease
speaking, <I>went back on me</I> for deceived me or took advantage of me,
a <I>power of people</I> for a great many
<P>
  <HR>
14
<P align=justify class=full>
people, a <I>power of money</I> for great wealth, a <I>heap of houses</I>
for many houses, <I>lots of books</I> for many books, <I>lots of corn</I>
for much corn or large quantities of corn, <I>gents</I> for gentlemen, and
many others of a similar character.
<P>
  <HR>
15
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4><b>Choice of Words</B></h4>
<P>
Our American writers evince much variety in their graces of diction, but
in the accurate choice of words James Russell Lowell and William Cullen Bryant
stand out conspicuous above the rest. So careful and persistent was the latter,
that during the time that he was editor of <I>The Evening Post,</I> of New
York City, he required the various writers upon that paper to avoid the use
of a long list of words and expressions which he had prepared for them, and
which were commonly employed by other papers. This list was not only used,
but enlarged by his successors.
<P>
Strive to cultivate the habit of observing words; trace their delicate shades
of meaning as employed by the most polished writers; note their suggestiveness;
mark the accuracy with which they are chosen. In this way your mind will
be kept on the alert to discover the beauties as well as the blemishes of
all the thought pictures that are presented, and your vocabulary will be
greatly enlarged and enriched.

<p class=center align=center>
  STILTS

<P>
Avoid bombastic language. Work for plain expressions rather than for the
unusual. Use the simplest words that the subject will bear.
<P>
The following clipping, giving an account of the commencement exercises of
a noted female college, strikingly illustrates what to avoid:
<P>
"Like some beacon-light upon a rock-bound coast against which the surges
of the ocean unceasingly roll, and casting its beams far across the waters
warning the mariner from the danger near, the college, like a Gibraltar,
stands upon the high plains of learning, shedding its rays of knowledge,
from the murmurings of the Atlantic to the whirlwinds of the Pacific, guiding
womankind from the dark valley of ignorance, and wooing her with wisdom's
lore, leads creation's fairest, purest, best into flowery dells where she
can pluck the richest food of knowledge, and crowns her brow with a coronet
of gems whose brilliancy can never grow dim: for they glisten with the purest
thought, that seems as a spark struck from the mind of Deity. There is no
need for the daughters of this community to seek colleges of distant climes
whereat to be educated, for right here in their own city, God's paradise
on earth, is situated a noble college, the bright diadem of that paradise,
that has done more for the higher education of woman than any institution
in our land."
<P>
  <HR>
19
<p class=center align=center>
  PURITY

<P>
An author's diction is pure when he uses such words only as belong to the
idiom of the language. The only standard of purity is the practice of the
best writers and speakers. A violation of purity is called a barbarism.
<P>
Unlike the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, the English is a living language, and,
like all living organisms, manifests its life by taking in new material and
casting off old waste continually. Science, art, and philosophy give rise
to new ideas which, in turn, demand new words for their expression. Of these,
some gain a permanent foothold, while others float awhile upon the currents
of conversation and newspaper literature and then disappear.
<P>
Good usage is the only real authority in the choice of reputable words; and
to determine, in every case, what good usage dictates, is not an easy matter.
Authors, like words, must be tested by time before their forms of expression
may become a law for others. Pope, in his <I>Essay on Criticism,</I> laid
down a rule which, for point and brevity, has never been excelled:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

  "In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;<BR>
  &nbsp;Alike fantastic, if too new or old;<BR>
  &nbsp;Be not the first by whom the new are tried,<BR>
  &nbsp;Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  <HR>
20
<p class=center align=center>
  BARBARISMS

<P>
Campbell, in his <I>Philosophy of Rhetoric,</I> says that a word to be legitimate
must have these three signs of authority:
<OL>
  <LI>
    It must be <I>reputable,</I> or that of educated people, as opposed to that
    of the ignorant or vulgar.
  <LI>
    It must be <I>national,</I> as opposed to what is either local or technical.
  <LI>
    It must be <I>present,</I> as opposed to what is obsolete.
</OL>
<P>
Any word that does not have these three qualities may, in general, be styled
a barbarism.
<p class=center align=center>
  ANGLICIZED WORDS

<P>
Many foreign words, in process of time, become so thoroughly domesticated
that their translation, or the use of an awkward equivalent, would be a greater
mark of pedantry than the use of the foreign words. The proper use of such
terms as <I>fiat, palladium, cabal, quorum, omnibus, antique, artiste, coquette,
ennui, physique, regime, tableau, amateur,</I> cannot be censured on the
ground of their foreign character.
<p class=center align=center>
  OBSOLETE WORDS

<P>
Some writers affect an antiquated style by the introduction of such words
as <I>peradventure, perchance,</I>
<P>
  <HR>
21
<p align=justify class=full>
<I>anon, behest, quoth, erewhile.</I> The use of such words gives a strange
sound to the sentence, and generally indicates that the writer is not thoroughly
in earnest. The expression is lowered in tone and is made to sound fantastic.
<p class=center align=center>
  NEW WORDS

<P>
A word should not be condemned because it is new. If it is really needed
it will be welcomed, and soon find a permanent place. Shakespeare, Addison,
and Johnson introduced many new words, to which their names afterward gave
a sanction. Carlyle, Coleridge, Tennyson, and Browning have introduced or
given currency to new words, and made strange ones familiar.
<P>
New words are objectionable when they are employed without proper authority.
The chief sources of supply of the objectionable kind are the current slang
of the street and the sensational newspaper. They are often the result of
a desire to say things in such a manner as to reflect smartness upon the
speaker, or to present things in a humorous or picturesque way. That they
are frequently very effective cannot be gainsaid. Sometimes they are coined
in the heat of political or social discussion, and, for a time, express what
everybody is talking about; but it is impossible to tell whether they will
live beyond
<P>
  <HR>
22
<p align=justify class=full>
the occasion that produced them. So long as their usage is doubtful it is
safer not to employ them.
<p class=center align=center>
  SLANG

<P>
Slang is somewhat like chicken-pox or measles, very catching, and just as
inevitable in its run; and very few of us escape it. It is severest, too,
where the sanitary conditions are most favorable to its development. Where
there is least thought and culture to counteract its influence slang words
crowd out those of a more serious character, until, in time, the young and
inexperienced speaker or writer is unable to distinguish between the counterfeit
and the genuine.
<P>
While most persons condemn slang, there are very few who are entirely free
from its use. It varies greatly in its degrees of coarseness or refinement,
and adapts itself to all classes and conditions. Many know no other language,
and we are unwillingly compelled to admit that while their speech is often
ungrammatical and unrhetorical, it is generally clear, concise, and forcible.
<P>
Strive to acquire a vocabulary so large and to cultivate a taste so fine
that when a slang expression rises to your mind you can use it if you think
it best fits the occasion, or substitute something better in its place. Purity
of diction is a garden of slow growth even under the most favorable conditions,
and the
<P>
  <HR>
23
<p align=justify class=full>
unrestrained indulgence in slang is like scattering seeds of the vilest plants
among the choicest flowers.
<p class=center align=center>
  SOCIETY SLANG

<P>
"This is an <I>elegant</I> day," "that is an <I>elegant</I> view," "Mary
is <I>awfully nice," "</I>Jennie is <I>dreadfully sweet,"</I> "Gertrude is
<I>delicious,"</I> and "Tom is <I>perfectly splendid."</I> The use of such
extravagant phrases tends to weaken the significance of the words when
legitimately employed.
<p class=center align=center>
  COMMERCIAL SLANG

<P>
Commercial terms are employed in the common language of everyday life to
such an extent as to constitute a form of commercial slang. The following
will serve for illustration; "The <I>balance</I> of the journey" for remainder,
"he was <I>well posted."</I> for well informed, "I <I>calculate</I> he will
come to-morrow" for believe or think, "I <I>reckon</I> he is your friend"
for I suppose.
<p class=center align=center>
  COMMON SLANG

<P>
To materialize, to burglarize, to enthuse, to suicide, to wire, to jump upon,
to sit upon, to take in, are a few of the many examples of slang that should
be avoided.

  PROVINCIALISMS

<P>
A word that is used only in a limited part of the country is called a
provincialism. It must be known and recognized for what it is worth, but
not obtruded where it does not belong.
<P>
Whatever may be said of the faults of speech of the American people, it is
doubtful if any other nation, whether it covers a large territory or is limited
in area, speaks the language native to the country with the uniformity that
we do. Yet, there are peculiarities that mark the expression of most of our
people, even among the best informed. The words <I>calculate, reckon,</I>
and <I>guess</I> are not the only words that betray the locality of the speaker.
Any person who has been five hundred miles from home cannot fail to have
observed words that were used differently from the way in which he had been
accustomed to use them, and he probably heard terms of expression that seemed
strange to him. In like manner, his own expressions sounded strange to those
who heard him. That which distinguished his speech from theirs and theirs
from his would, in large part, be covered by the word "provincialism."
<P>
Not only do we have local and sectional peculiarities of speech, but we may
be said to have national mannerisms. Mr. Alexander Melville Bell, the eminent
<P>
  <HR>
25
<p align=justify class=full>
elocutionist, relates that some years ago when residing in Edinburgh, a stranger
called to make some inquiries in regard to professional matters.
<P>
"I have called on you, sir, for the purpose of," etc.
<P>
"When did you cross the Atlantic?" I asked.
<P>
The stranger looked up with surprise amounting almost to consternation.
<P>
"How do you know that I have crossed the Atlantic?"
<P>
"Your manner of using the little word 'sir' is not heard in England or Scotland."
<P>
This gentleman, Mr. Bell says, was one of the most eminent teachers of elocution
in America, and his speech was perfectly free from ordinary local coloring,
in all but the one little element which had escaped observation.
<p class=center align=center>
  WHICH?

<P>
Much diversity of usage exists and some difference of opinion prevails concerning
the proper expression to use when you are addressed, and fail to understand
just what has been said. Such interrogative rejoinders as <I>"What?" "How?"
"Which?" "Hey?"</I> are plainly objectionable. <I>"Sir?" </I>and
<I>"Madam!"</I> once common, are no longer tolerated in society. The English
expression <I>"Beg pardon"</I> has found favor, but it is not wholly acceptable.
<I>"Excuse me"</I>
<P>
  <HR>
26
<p align=justify class=full>
is suggested by a writer on the subject. It has no more syllables than <I>"Beg
pardon,"</I> and is nearly equivalent in signification, but it is also subject
to the objection that it is often used to imply a difference of opinion,
as when a person makes a statement to which you take exception, you begin
your reply with the expression, <I>"Excuse me."</I>
<P>
Whatever is adopted will doubtless be a convenient contraction, like <I>"Beg
pardon,"</I> which is a short way of saying, "I beg your pardon for failing
to understand what you said;" or "<I>Excuse me,"</I> which is a condensation
of "Excuse me for not fully grasping your meaning."
<p class=center align=center>
  WORDS IMPROPERLY USED
  <P>
  <B>Commodious&#8212;Convenient</B>

<P>
A word of caution in the use of the smaller dictionaries is necessary. The
most elaborate definition often fails to give an adequate idea of the
signification of a term unless it is accompanied with one or more quotations
illustrating its use. The small dictionaries give only the briefest definitions,
without illustration, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.
<P>
Some years ago a young man of moderate attainments was very desirous of enlarging
his vocabulary
<P>
  <HR>
27
<p align=justify class=full>
and of using words beyond the ordinary vernacular of his neighborhood. To
this end, he made a small vest-pocket lexicon his constant companion.
<P>
Having consulted it in the course of a conversation with a friend, he remarked,
as he was about to return it to his pocket, "What a commodious book this
is." His friend suggested that he again consult the "commodious" volume.
With a look of the utmost confidence he turned to the word, and exclaimed:
"There! I knew I was right. <I>Commodious</I> means <I>convenient,</I> and
that is just what this little book is."
<P>
It was useless to explain that smallness sometimes renders a thing inconvenient,
and this young man, doubtless, still felicitates himself upon his intimate
acquaintance with that <I>commodious</I> pocket dictionary.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Ability, Capacity</B>

<P>
A fond mother was told by the principal of a boarding-school that her daughter
would not be graduated, as she lacked capacity. "Get her a capacity. Her
father don't stand on the matter of expense. Get her anything she wants.
He'll foot the bill." But for once the indulgent mother was obliged to learn
that there are some things money will not purchase. The father had the financial
<I>ability,</I> but the daughter lacked the necessary intellectual
<I>capacity.</I>
<P>
  <HR>
28
<p align=justify class=full>
But we may have literary as well as financial ability. <I>Ability </I>implies
the power of doing; <I>capacity</I> the faculty of receiving.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>About, Almost</B>

<P>
"This work is <I>about</I> done." Use "<I>almost</I> done."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Acceptance, Acceptation</B>

<P>
These words cannot be used interchangeably. "He wrote signifying his
<I>acceptance</I> of the office." "According to the common <I>acceptation</I>
of this term, he is a knave."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Access, Accession</B>

<P>
"He gained <I>access</I> to the fort." "The only <I>accession,</I> which
the Roman empire received was the province of Britain."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Accident, Injury</B>

<P>
Accident is sometimes used incorrectly for <I>injury.</I> as "His
<I>accident</I> was very painful."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Mutual, Common</B>

<P>
Some men seek to be great by copying great men's faults. Dickens may say
"Our Mutual Friend," but Dickens's strong point was not grammar. If you have
a friend in common with Smith, in speaking of him to Smith, say our <I>common
</I>friend. The word <I>mutual</I> should always convey a sense of reciprocity,
as "Happy in our mutual help and mutual love."
<P>
  <HR>
29
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Myself</B>

<P>
This word is generally used for emphasis, as "I <I>myself</I> will do it,"
"I wrote it <I>myself."</I> It should not be used for the unemphatic pronouns
<I>I</I> and <I>me,</I> as in "James and <I>myself</I> are going to town,"
"He gave the books to James and <I>myself."</I> It is properly used with
a reflexive verb without emphasis, as "I will defend <I>myself."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Negligence, Neglect</B>

<P>
<I>Negligence</I> is the habit, <I>neglect</I> the act, of leaving things
undone. The adjectives <I>negligent</I> and <I>neglectful</I> should, in
like manner, be discriminated.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Never, Not</B>

<P>
The word <I>never</I> is sometimes colloquially used for <I>not, </I>as "I
<I>never</I> remember to have seen Lincoln." Say "I <I>do not </I>remember,"
etc. <I>Never</I> should not be used in reference to events that can take
place but once, as "Warren <I>never</I> died at Lexington."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Love, Like</B>

<P>
We may <I>love</I> our parents, our children, our country, the truth; and
we may <I>like</I> roast turkey and cranberry sauce. "I <I>love </I>cherries,"
"I <I>adore</I> strawberries," are school-girl expressions that should be
avoided. Love is an emotion of the heart, and not of the palate.
<P>
  <HR>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Cheap, Low-priced</B>

<P>
These words are often used synonymously. A picture purchased for ten thousand
dollars may be cheap; another, for which ten dollars was paid, although
low-priced, may be dear.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Mad, Angry</B>

<P>
The frequent use of <I>mad</I> in the sense of angry should be avoided. A
person who is insane is <I>mad.</I> A dog that has hydrophobia is <I>mad.</I>
Figuratively we say <I>mad,</I> with rage, <I>mad</I> with terror, <I>mad</I>
with pain; but to be vexed, or angry, or out of patience, does not justify
the use of so strong a term as <I>mad.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Most, Almost, Very</B>

<P>
Sometimes incorrectly used for <I>almost,</I> as "He writes to me <I>most</I>
every week."
<P>
It is often loosely used in the sense of <I>very,</I> as "This is a <I>most
</I>interesting book." Aim to use <I>most</I> only as the superlative of
<I>much</I>, or <I>many.</I> Do not use the indefinite article before it,
as "This is <I>a most</I> beautiful picture." We may say "This is <I>the
most </I>beautiful picture," for here comparison is implied.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Portion, Part</B>

<P>
"Give me the <I>portion</I> of goods that falleth to me." "We traveled a
<I>part</I> of the distance on foot." <I>Portion</I> is applied to that which
is set aside for a special
<P>
  <HR>
31
<p align=justify class=full>
purpose, often as the share or allotment of an individual, as the wife's
<I>portion,</I> the <I>portion</I> of the oldest son, etc. <I>Part</I> is
a more general term.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Postal</B>

<P>
Bryant would not have said, "I will send you a <I>postal</I> by to-morrow's
mail." <I>Postal card</I> or <I>post card</I> would be better.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Practical, Practicable</B>

<P>
These words are sometimes confounded. <I>Practicable</I> means "that may
be done or accomplished," and implies that the means or resources are available;
as, a <I>practicable</I> road, a <I>practicable</I> aim. <I>Practical</I>
means "capable of being turned to use or account;" as, "The <I>practical</I>
man begins by doing; the theorist often ends by thinking."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Predicate</B>

<P>
This word is sometimes incorrectly used in the sense of <I>form </I>or
<I>base;</I> as, "He <I>predicated</I> his statement on the information he
had just received." Neither should it be used in the sense of <I>predict;
</I>as, "The sky is overcast, and I <I>predicate</I> a storm tomorrow."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Prefer&#8212;than</B>

  <B>Amount, Number</B>

<P>
<I>Amount</I> applies to what is thought of in the mass or bulk, as money,
wheat, coal. <I>Number</I> is used when we think of the individuals composing
the mass, as men, books, horses, vessels.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Answer, Reply</B>

<P>
An <I>answer</I> implies a question. We may <I>reply</I> to a remark or

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Antagonize, Alienate, Oppose</B>

<P>
The word <I>antagonize</I> should not be used in the sense of
<I>alienate;</I> as, "Your proposition will <I>antagonize</I> many supporters
of the measure." "The Senate <I>opposed</I> the bill which passed the House"
is better than "<I>antagonized</I> the bill."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Anticipate, Expect</B>

  <B>Any, At all</B>

what was said."

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Apparent, Evident</B>

<P>
These words are often used interchangeably. That which is <I>apparent</I>
may be what it appears to be, or it may be very different; that which is
<I>evident </I>admits of no doubt. The same is true of <I>apparently</I>
and <I>evidently.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Prejudice</B>

<P>
"He is not the best person for the position, but his many kindnesses to me
<I>prejudice</I> me in his favor." We may be prejudiced against a person
or thing, but cannot be prejudiced in favor. Use <I>predispose.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Presume</B>

<P>
This word is often employed when <I>think, believe,</I> or <I>daresay </I>would
be better.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Pretend, Profess</B>

<P>
"I do not <I>pretend</I> to be an orator." <I>Pretend</I> means <I>to feign,
to sham;</I> as, "He <I>pretends</I> to be asleep," and should not be used
when <I>claim</I> or <I>profess</I> would better suit the purpose.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Preventative</B>

<P>
The correct form of the word is <I>preventive,</I> not <I>preventative.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Previous, Previously</B>

<P>
The adjective <I>previous</I> is often incorrectly used for the adverb
<I>previously;</I> as, "Previous to his imprisonment he made a confession
of his crime."

  <HR>
34
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Promise, Assure</B>

<P>
"I <I>promise</I> you we had a good time yesterday." <I>Promise</I> relates
to the future, hence "I <I>assure</I> you," etc., would be better.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Propose, Purpose</B>

<P>
To <I>propose</I> is to set before the mind for consideration; to
<I>purpose</I> is to intend. "I <I>propose</I> sending my son to college"
should be "I <I>purpose,"</I> etc. "I <I>propose</I> that you go to college,
my son." "Thank you, father, I accept the proposal."

  <B>Sparrowgrass, Asparagus</B>

<P>
The word <I>sparrowgrass,</I> which is a corruption of the word
<I>asparagus,</I> illustrates how readily the uneducated mind associates
an unusual term with another that is familiar, and as the mental impression
is received through the ear, and lacks that definiteness which the printed
form would give, the new idea, when repeated, often assumes a picturesque,
if not a ludicrous, form. Many of Mrs. Partington's quaint sayings furnish
further illustration.
<P>
The following incident, from a Western paper, shows the successive stages
in the farmer's mental operations from the familiar terms <I>skin, hide,
oxhide, </I>up to the unfamiliar chemical term <I>oxide,</I> through which
he was obliged to pass before he succeeded in making known his wants:

"What can we do for you?" inquired the clerk.

"I want black&#8212; something of something," he said; "have you got any?"
<P>
"Probably we have," replied the clerk, "but you'll have to be more definite
than that to get it."
<P>
The farmer thought for a moment.
<P>
"Got any black sheepskin of something?" he asked.
<P>
"No; we don't keep sheepskins. We have chamois-skins, though."
<P>
"That ain't it, I know," said the customer. "Got any other kind of skins?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"Skins&#8212; skins&#8212; skins!" slowly repeated the man, struggling with his slippery
memory. "Calfskin seems to be something like it. Got any black calfskins
of anything?"
<P>
"No, not one," and the clerk laughed.
<P>
The customer grew red in the face.
<P>
"Confound it!" he said, "if it ain't a skin, what in thunder is it?"
<P>
"Possibly it's a hide?" suggested the clerk.

The clerk's face showed a gleam of intelligence, and then broke into a smile.
<P>
"Possibly it's black oxide of manganese you want?" he said, quietly.
<P>
"Of course, that's it!" he exclaimed, as he threw his arms around the clerk's

<I>Proven</I> is sometimes incorrectly used for <I>proved.</I> "The evidence

In some parts of the country this expression is in common use in the sense

  <B>Commence, Begin</B>

<P>
Some persons always <I>commence,</I> but never <I>begin.</I> The tendency
toward pomp and parade in speech prompts many persons to avoid the use of
our strong, rugged Anglo-Saxon words, and to substitute their high-sounding
Latin equivalents, until, in time, the preferable native forms come to be

  <B>Conscious, Aware</B>

"He was <I>aware</I> of the enemy's designs." "<I>Conscious</I> of his fate,

  <B>Convict, Convince</B>

<P>
The Irishman who brandished his club and, exclaimed that he was open to
conviction, but he would like to see the man that could convince him, used
a form of argument that was most convincing, but failed in his discrimination
of language. <I>Convict</I> refers to the outer condition, and generally
applies to something wrong; <I>convince,</I> which may be used of either
right or wrong, refers to the judgment.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Custom, Habit</B>

<P>
<I>Habit</I> is a tendency which leads us to do easily; <I>custom</I> grows
out of the habitual doing or frequent repetition of the same act. <I>Custom
</I>refers to the usages of society, or of the individual; <I>habit</I> refers
more frequently to the individual acts. "Ill <I>habits</I> gather by unseen

These words are often used interchangeably, but should be discriminated.
<I>Need</I> implies the lack; <I>want</I> also implies the lack, but couples
with it the wish to supply the lack. "Some men <I>need</I> help, but will

they do, and ask for it) and get it, too."

  <B>Way, Away</B>

<P>
"He is <I>way</I> down in Florida," is incorrect. "He is <I>away </I>down
in Florida" is better grammar. "He is in Florida" is still better.
<I>Down</I> indicates the direction, and <I>away</I> magnifies the distance.
As most persons know the direction, and as modern railway travel shortens
long distances, the abbreviated sentence is sufficiently full.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Ways, Way</B>

"He is a long <I>ways</I> from home" is a very common, but faulty expression.

transposing <I>whole</I> and <I>all. "All</I> of the scholars went to the
fair to-day," not half of them. "The <I>whole</I> school went to the fair

  <B>Real, Really</B>

<P>
<I>Real</I> is often incorrectly used as an adverb, especially by schoolgirls;
as, "I think he is <I>real</I> mean." The grammar will be improved by
substituting <I>really</I> for <I>real,</I> but the expression, as a whole,
being applied to all kinds and degrees of offenses, has become meaningless.

<I>Real</I> is often carelessly used in the sense of <I>very;</I> as <I>real

  <B>Remit, Send</B>

<P>
The word <I>remit</I> is often used when <I>send</I> would be better.
<I>Remit</I> means to send back, to forgive, to relax. In its commercial
sense it means to transmit or send money in payment of a demand; as, "He
<I>remitted </I>the amount by mail."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Residence, House</B>

"The walls of many public buildings are <I>defaced</I> by persons who desire
that their names shall remain when they are gone." "They <I>disfigure</I>
their faces that they may appear unto men to fast." <I>Disfigure</I> applies
more generally to persons; <I>deface,</I> to things.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Demean, Degrade</B>

<P>
The word <I>demean</I> is often incorrectly used in the sense of <I>degrade,

and not in the sense of <I>degrade.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Depot, Station</B>

<P>
For many years the word <I>depot</I> was largely employed in the sense of

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Description, Kind</B>

<P>
"Flowers of every <I>description</I> were found in his garden." In the above
sense the word <I>kind</I> or <I>variety</I> would be more appropriate.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Bring, Fetch, Carry</B>

<P>
<I>Bring</I> implies motion from the object toward the person who issues
the command or makes the request. <I>Fetch</I> implies two motions, first,
toward the object; second, toward the person who wishes it. The gardener,
who is in the garden, calls to his servant, who is at the barn, "John,
<I>bring</I> me the rake. You will find it in the barn." And if John is with
him in the garden, he would say, "John, <I>fetch</I> me the rake from the
barn."
<P>
The use of <I>fetch</I> is more common among English writers than with us.
In fact, many speakers and writers in America rarely use the word.
<P>
<I>Carry</I> is a more general term, and means <I>to convey,</I> without
thought of the direction.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Character, Reputation</B>

These words are often confounded. "Character," says Abbott, "is what a person
is; reputation is what he is supposed to be. Character is in himself,
<P>
  <HR>
45
<p align=justify class=full>
reputation is in the minds of others. Character is injured by temptations
and by wrong-doing; reputation by slanders and libels. Character endures
throughout defamation in every form, but perishes where there is a voluntary
transgression; reputation may last through numerous transgressions, but be
destroyed by a single, and even an unfounded, accusation or aspersion."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Farther, Further</B>

<P>
Although these words are often used interchangeably even by good writers,
yet a finer taste and a keener power of discrimination is shown in the use
of <I>farther</I> when referring to literal distance, and of <I>further </I>in
reference to quantity or degree; as, "Each day's journey removes them
<I>farther</I> from home," "He concluded his speech by remarking that he
had nothing <I>further</I> to say." <I>Farther</I> is the comparative of
<I>far; further</I> is the comparative of <I>forth.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Fault, Defect</B>

<P>
Speakers and writers often fail to discriminate in the use of these words.
A <I>defect</I> implies a deficiency, a lack, a falling short, while a
<I>fault</I> signifies that there is something wrong.

These words and their comparatives, <I>fewer, less,</I> are often confounded.
<I>Few</I> relates to number, or to what may be counted; <I>little </I>refers
to quantity, or to what may be measured. A man may have <I>few </I>books
and <I>little</I> money; he may have <I>fewer</I> friends and <I>less
</I>influence than his neighbor. But do not say "The man has <I>less
</I>friends than his neighbor."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Each other, One another</B>

<P>
While some excellent authorities use these expressions interchangeably, most
grammarians and authors employ <I>each other</I> in referring to two persons
or things, and <I>one another</I> when more than two are considered; as,
"Both contestants speak kindly of <I>each other." </I>"Gentlemen are always
polite to <I>one another."</I>
<P>
Those who prefer to have wide latitude in speech will be glad to know that
Murray, in one of the rules in his grammar, says, "Two negatives in English
destroy <I>one another."</I>

Shakespeare says, "It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.
I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of
<P>

<p align=justify class=full>
the twenty to follow mine own teaching." This is as true of expression as
of morals.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Either, Neither</B>

<P>
"Palms and beautiful flowers lined the hall on <I>either</I> side," is a
common but faulty form of expression. <I>Either</I> refers to one of two
things. In the foregoing sentence the thought is that <I>both</I> sides of
the hall were lined, hence the word <I>both</I> should have been used. If,
however, each side of the hall is thought of separately, then <I>each,</I>
would be the proper word to employ.
<P>
<I>"Either</I> of the two books will please you." <I>"Any</I> of the three
books will prove satisfactory." <I>"Any one</I> of the five men would make
a good candidate." <I>"Neither</I> of the two men will serve." <I>"None</I>
of the ten men were present." "<I>Not one</I> of all the houses was left
standing." These sentences represent the best usage with regard to <I>either,
neither,</I> and also of <I>any, none, any one, not one.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>These kind</B>

<P>
Adjectives implying number must agree with the nouns which they qualify.
<I>This</I> and <I>that</I> qualify nouns in the singular; <I>these </I>and
<I>those</I> belong to nouns in the plural.
<P>
<I>"These kind</I> of potatoes grow well in this soil." Use <I>this. "This

"For <I>this</I> reason, among others, I abandoned the profession." "He rides
the bicycle daily, and by <I>this means</I> he preserves his health." "The
partners were all honest, courteous, and industrious, and by <I>these means
</I>acquired wealth." The word <I>means</I> being either singular or plural,
the two preceding sentences are both correct.

<P>
With equal propriety we may say, "He offered no objection except the one
already mentioned," or "He read five books on 'Crime and Its Causes' in addition
to those you named." It is the use of the word <I>other,</I> or
<I>otherwise,</I> or <I>else,</I> that makes necessary the correlative term
<I>than.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Besides</B>

<P>
After <I>else</I> and <I>other</I> the preposition <I>besides</I> is sometimes

"Other boys <I>besides</I> these are mischievous."
<P>
"Other arts <I>besides</I> music are elevating and inspiring."
<P>
"We must have recourse to something else <I>besides</I> punishment."
<P>
It will be observed that the use of <I>besides</I> in this section differs
from the use of <I>than</I> in the preceding discussion. <I>"Other... than"
</I>is exclusive of those mentioned; whereas, "<I>other... besides"
</I>includes those mentioned.

"Iron is more useful than all the metals." The faultiness of this sentence

The sentence should, therefore, read, "Iron is more useful than all the
<I>other </I>metals."

"The Washington monument is higher than any monument in America." Since it

In a general sense <I>fly</I> is applied to winged creatures and <I>flee</I>
to persons. "What exile from himself can <I>flee?"</I> "When the swallows
homeward <I>fly."</I> The past tense forms are sometimes confused, as, "The

<P>
The verbs <I>flew</I> and <I>fled</I> in the foregoing sentences should be

<P>
  <HR>

<p align=justify class=full>

Those who are disposed to overwork the words <I>get</I> and <I>got</I> will
find it interesting and profitable to read the foregoing exercise, substituting
other words for those in italics.
<P>

Like <I>a good deal</I> and some other idioms, this expression is denounced

This word is much used by young ladies in speaking of what is small, or dainty,

  <B>Balance, Remainder</B>

<P>
This word, like numerous others, has been borrowed from the commercial world,

the timber this year, and expect to cut the <I>balance</I> next spring."
"My cousin will remain with us the <I>balance</I> of this week." "James ate
half of the melon to-day, and will eat the <I>balance</I> to-morrow." In
these and all similar cases the word <I>remainder</I> should be used.
<I>Balance</I> is a term that applies to accounts, and signifies the amount

  <B>Those kind, These sort</B>

<P>
"It is unpleasant to have to associate with <I>those kind</I> of people."
"<I>These sort</I> of sheep are the most profitable." <I>Kind</I> and
<I>sort</I> are nouns of the singular number; <I>these</I> and <I>those</I>
are plural, and, according to the laws of grammar, the adjective and noun
must agree in number. The corrected sentences will read: "It is unpleasant
to have to associate with <I>this kind</I> of people." <I>"This sort</I>
of sheep is the most profitable." The fault arises by associating in the
mind the adjectives <I>these</I> and <I>those</I> with the nouns <I>sheep</I>
and <I>people,</I> which nouns are more prominent in the mind than the nouns
<I>kind</I> and <I>sort.</I> If the ear is not satisfied, the sentences may

This word, from <I>trans,</I> across, through, and <I>spirare,</I> to breathe,
means, physiologically, to pass off in the form of vapor or insensible
perspiration, or, botanically, to evaporate from living cells. Its general
meaning is to become known, to escape from secrecy.
<P>
It is frequently employed in the sense of to occur, to come to pass, but

proceedings of the secret session of the council soon <I>transpired."</I>

  <B>Make, Manufacture</B>

<P>
These words may, in some cases, be used interchangeably, but <I>make</I>
has much the wider range of meanings. The following story, related by Eli
Perkins, will illustrate this fact:
<P>
I was talking one day with Mr. Depew, President of the New York Central Railroad,
about demand and supply. I said the price of any commodity is always controlled
by the demand and supply.
<P>
"Not always, Eli," said Depew; "demand and supply don't always govern prices.
Business tact sometimes governs them."
<P>
"When," I asked, "did an instance ever occur when the price did not depend
on demand and supply?"
<P>
  <HR>

<P>
"Well," said Mr. Depew, "the other day I stepped up to a German butcher,
and, out of curiosity, asked:

"'What's the price of sausages?'

"'Dwenty cends a bound,' he said.

"'You asked twenty-five this morning,' I replied.
<P>
"'Yah; dot vas ven I had some. Now I ain't got none, I sell him for dwenty
cents. Dot makes a repudation for selling cheab, und I don't lose noddings.'
<P>
"You see," said Mr. Depew, laughing, "I didn't want any sausage and the man
didn't have any; no demand and no supply, and still the price of sausage
went down five cents."
<P>
"Well, there are strange things in this world," I said. "Now, take the words
<I>manufacture</I> and <I>make.</I> I always thought that both words meant
the same thing."
<P>
"Why, they do, Eli," said Mr. Depew.
<P>
"Not always," I said.
<P>
"Now, when could they have a different meaning?"
<P>
"Why, this morning I came down from Albany on a Central car <I>manufactured

"The <I>veracity</I> of his statement is doubted." The sentence should be,

"They are <I>trying the experiment</I> of running railroad trains by

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Can but, Cannot but</B>

<P>
These expressions are sometimes confounded. "If I perish, I <I>can but

The verbs <I>lie</I> and <I>lay</I> are often confounded, even by intelligent

It is therefore intransitive.
<P>
<I>Lay,</I> which means to place in position, requires an object. We <I>lay
</I>a book on a table, or bricks on the wall. It is therefore transitive.
<P>
The principal parts of the first verb are <I>lie, lay, lain;</I> and of the
second, <I>lay, laid, laid.</I> The word <I>lay</I> is found in both, and
this is, in part, accountable for the confusion. The most frequent errors
result from using <I>laid,</I> the past tense form of the transitive verb,
when the word <I>lay,</I> the past tense form of the intransitive verb, should
be used. The ear naturally expects the usual past tense ending of the
<I>d</I> or <I>t </I>sound, and as that is absent in the past tense of
<I>lie,</I> the past tense form of the other verb is substituted. For the
same reason the participle form <I>laid</I> is often incorrectly used for

"I see him at his office <I>each</I> day of the week." In this sentence the
word <I>every</I> would be better. <I>Each</I> refers to single days
particularized. Here reference is made to what occurs on all days without
exception.

  <B>Each, Both</B>

<P>
<I>"Both</I> parties maintained their original positions." As the parties

its original position." "Both parties strove to place their best candidates
upon the ticket" is correct, because the parties are thought of collectively.

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Fewer, Less</B>

  <B>Right smart</B>

<I>Dry</I> is often incorrectly used in the sense of <I>thirsty; </I>as,

  <B>Drive, Ride</B>

<P>
Some confusion exists in the use of the words <I>drive</I> and <I>ride.</I>
In England the distinction is made of applying <I>ride</I> to going on horseback
and <I>drive</I> to going in a carriage, whether you ride or drive. That
usage is not closely followed in this country. He who guides the horse
<I>drives;</I> the rest of the company <I>ride.</I> The noun and participial
forms are more excusable than the verb. "Jones asked me to <I>drive </I>with
him this afternoon." But as Jones expects to do the driving himself, the
speaker should have said, "Jones asked me to <I>take a ride,"</I> or <I>"go
driving,"</I> or <I>"take a drive,"</I> etc.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Couple, Several</B>

<P>
The word <I>couple</I> is often incorrectly used in the sense of
<I>several;</I> as, a <I>couple</I> of horses, mules, birds, trees, houses,
etc. The use of the word <I>couple</I> is not only limited to two, but to
two that may be coupled or yoked together. A man and wife are spoken of as
a <I>couple.</I> We speak of a <I>span</I> of horses, a <I>yoke</I> of oxen,

  <B>Directly, Immediately, As soon as</B>

<P>
A faulty English use of the above words has found some favor in the United
States. <I>"Directly</I> the whistle blew the workmen left the shop." Say
<I>"As soon as</I> the whistle blew," etc. <I>"Immediately</I> he closed
his speech his opponent rose to reply." Say "<I>When"</I> or <I>"As soon
as </I>he closed his speech," etc.
<P>
<I>Directly</I> denotes without any delay; <I>immediately</I> implies without
any interposition of other occupation.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Agreeably disappointed</B>

<P>
When our hopes are blasted, our plans balked, our expectations defeated,
our intentions thwarted, we are <I>disappointed.</I> We prefer the agreeable

we are disappointed, but not <I>agreeably disappointed.</I> If the new
conditions, which are not of our seeking, prove agreeable, it is only after
the sense of disappointment has vanished.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Allude to, Refer to, Mention</B>

<P>
The word <I>allude</I> is often incorrectly used. Allusion is the by-play
of language. It means to hint at by remote suggestions, to speak of figuratively
or sportively.
<P>
Whatever is directly mentioned, or spoken of, or described, cannot be said
to be <I>alluded to.</I> The terms

  <B>Emigrants, Immigrants</B>

These words are sometimes confounded. "Did you see the <I>emigrants</I> on

directly to Italy?" Exchange the italicized words in the two sentences and
they will be correctly used.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Somewheres</B>

<P>
The terminal <I>s</I> should be omitted in such words as <I>anywheres,
somewheres, nowheres, anyways, hereabouts, thereabouts, whereabouts.</I>
In such cases as "Whereabouts did you find him?" and "We knew his whereabouts,"
the <I>s</I> is properly retained.

single objection,"</I> or <I>"no objection."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>First two</B>

<P>
Such has been the strong desire to continue to use forms of expression that
we have long used that not a little time and effort have been expended in
the endeavor to make the wrong appear right. It is an accepted fact, however,
that a large majority of the best speakers and writers now say <I>the first
two, the last five,</I> etc., rather than <I>the two first, the five last.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Future, Subsequent</B>

<P>
The word <I>future</I> is sometimes used instead of <I>subsequent; </I>as,
"Until he was eighteen years old his conduct was marked by cruelty and malice,
but his <I>future</I> life was characterized by kindness and generosity."
<I>Future</I> looks forward from the present, and not from some point of
time in the past.

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Sit, Set</B>

<P>
Few words afford a more fertile field for grammatical blundering than the
verbs <I>sit</I> and <I>set.</I> The important fact to remember in the use
of the words is that <I>sit,</I> in modern usage, is an intransitive verb,
and does not take an object, while <I>set,</I> which means <I>to place in
position, </I>is transitive, and requires an object to complete its meaning.
You cannot <I>sit</I> a thing, but you do <I>set</I> or place a thing.
<P>
The verb <I>sit</I> undergoes a slight change with the change of tense or
time. "I <I>sit</I> at the window today." "I <I>sat</I> at the window yesterday."
"I have <I>sat</I> at the window daily for many years." <I>"Sitting </I>at
the window, I saw the storm arise." "Having <I>sat</I> at his table, I can
testify to his hospitality."
<P>
The transitive verb <I>set</I> undergoes no tense changes. "See me <I>set</I>
this vase on the table." "He <I>set</I> his seal to the paper yesterday."
"Jones will not <I>set</I> the world on fire with his writings." "Having
<I>set </I>my affairs in order, I returned home." "I <I>sit</I> down." "I
<I>sat </I>down." "I <I>set</I> him down."
<P>
There are many intransitive uses of the verb <I>set;</I> as, "The sun
<I>sets,"</I> "The tide <I>sets</I> toward the south," "The fruit has <I>set,"
"</I>He <I>set</I> out for Boston."
<P>
There is a difference of opinion as to whether we should say "The coat <I>sets
</I>well" or "The coat <I>sits</I> well," with the greater weight in favor
of <I>sits.</I> "The
<P>
  <HR>
81
<P align=justify class=full>
hen <I>sits</I> on her eggs." "She is a <I>sitting</I> hen." When the verb
is used reflexively use <I>set</I> and not <I>sat;</I> as, "I <I>set</I>
me down beside her," not "I <I>sat</I> me down beside her."
<p class=center align=center>

  <B>Awful</B>

<P>
Few words among the many that go to make up the vocabulary of American slang
have been in longer use and have a wider range than the word <I>awful.</I>
From the loftiest and most awe-inspiring themes to the commonest trifle,
this much-abused word has been employed. A correct speaker or writer almost
fears to use the word lest he should suggest the idea of slang, and thus
detract from the subject to which the word might most fitly be applied.
<P>
Even the grammatical form of the word is often violated in such expressions
as "Isn't he <I>awful</I> nice?" "That hat of hers is <I>awful</I> pretty."
To say <I>awfully nice</I> and <I>awfully pretty</I> would improve the grammar,
but the gross vulgarism remains.
<P>
The word, when properly used, means "inspiring with awe or dread" often
accompanied with reverence, as when Milton says:
<P>
  <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

in conversation, they must be regarded as slang.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Bulk</B>

<P>
This word is often incorrectly used for <I>most</I> or <I>the greater part;

refers to size, not to numbers.
<p class=center align=center>

  <B>But what, But that</B>

<P>
"I don't know <I>but what</I> I shall have to punish him." The sentence should
read, "I don't know <I>but that</I> I shall have to punish him." It is equivalent
to, "I think that I shall have to punish him." The omission of <I>but</I>
will convey the opposite meaning. "I don't know that I shall have to punish

<I>Leave</I> is often incorrectly used for <I>quit;</I> as, "That eminent

<P>
"Henry has <I>quit</I> smoking." Here <I>left off</I> or <I>stopped</I> would

Avoid the use of <I>like</I> in the sense of <I>as</I>. "He thinks just <I>as

  <B>Nasty, Nice</B>

<P>
<I>Nasty</I> is a strong adjective, and should be used only in reference
to what is offensively filthy, foul, or defiled. Such expressions as a <I>nasty
</I>day, a <I>nasty</I> rain, mark a loose and careless use of the word.
<P>
The word <I>nice</I> once meant <I>foolish, ignorant, weak, effeminate.</I>
It has now come to mean <I>exact, fine, finished, exciting admiration on
account of skill or exactness;</I> as <I>nice</I> proportions, <I>nice</I>
workmanship, a <I>nice</I> distinction in philosophy. It is loosely and
colloquially used in application to what is pleasing, agreeable, delightful,
good.
<P>
A bright young lady was once asked, "Don't you think <I>nice</I> is a <I>nasty

  <B>O, Oh</B>

<P>
While good usage is far from uniform, many excellent authors employ <I>O</I>
only in cases of direct address and <I>oh</I> when strong and sudden emotion
is to be expressed. <I>O</I> is always written with a capital letter, and
should be followed by the name of the person or thing addressed, and the
exclamation or interrogation point placed at the end of the sentence; as,
"O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory?" "O the cold
and cruel winter!"
<P>
<I>Oh</I> in the body of a sentence may begin with a small letter, and is
immediately followed by the exclamation point; as, "Oh! how terrible was
his fate!" "The sad intelligence was gently given, but oh! the shock was
almost unbearable."

  <B>Observe, Say</B>

  <B>Older, Elder</B>

<P>
<I>Elder</I> and <I>eldest</I> are terms applied chiefly to persons, generally
in speaking of members of the same family, while <I>older</I> and <I>oldest
</I>are applied to persons of different families, and also to things.
<P>
"His <I>elder</I> brother died yesterday." "His <I>eldest</I> sister has
gone to Italy on her wedding trip." "Our <I>oldest</I> neighbor was born
in 1825." "This oak is <I>older</I> than that pine." The foregoing sentences
illustrate the best usage as applied to the comparatives <I>older</I> and
<I>elder</I> and the superlatives <I>oldest</I> and <I>eldest.</I>
<P>
When the direct comparison is made the word <I>older</I> is used, followed
by the conjunction <I>than;</I> as, "My father is <I>older than</I> my mother."
But when the comparison is assumed the word <I>elder</I> should be employed;
as, "My father is the <I>elder</I> of my parents."

  <B>Only</B>

<P>
Perhaps no other word in the language is so often misplaced as the word
<I>only.</I> The only general rule is to place it as near as possible to
the word which it modifies. "He <I>only</I> lent me a dollar" means that
he did not make me a present of the dollar, but expects me to return it.
"He lent me <I>only</I> a dollar" means that the sum lent was neither greater
nor less than one dollar. The former expression is often used when the latter
should be.

George Eliot, in <I>Middlemarch,</I> says: "I <I>only</I> know two gentlemen

There is a growing tendency to write the words <I>on</I> and <I>to</I> as

  <B>Plenty, Plentiful</B>

<P>
"Money is <I>plenty</I> this summer." <I>Plenty</I> is a noun and should
not be used as an adjective. Therefore "money is <I>plentiful</I> this summer."
Shakespeare says, "If reasons were as <I>plenty</I> as blackberries," etc.,
but words have settled into more definite grooves since Shakespeare's time.
"This house is <I>plenty</I> large enough." Neither is <I>plenty</I> an adverb.

  <B>Overlook, Oversee</B>

<P>
This word means to look down upon from a place that is over or above; as,
"From the top of the Washington monument you can readily <I>overlook</I>
the city." But it also means to look over and beyond an object in order to
see a second object, thus missing the view of the first object; hence, to
refrain from bestowing notice upon, to neglect. The confounding of these
two ideas begets ambiguity, as "Brown's business was <I>to overlook</I> the
workmen in the shop." His business was <I>to oversee</I> or
<I>superintend</I> them, and not to <I>neglect</I> or <I>overlook</I> them.

  <B>Revolting</B>

<P>
To <I>revolt</I> is to <I>rebel,</I> to <I>renounce allegiance,</I> but the
participial form <I>revolting</I> also means <I>repugnant, loathsome.</I>
In the sentence, "A band of <I>revolting</I> Huns has just passed down the
street," we should be in doubt whether the speaker referred to their acts
against the government or to their appearance. The use of the word
<I>rebellious</I> in the former sense, and of <I>disagreeable</I> or
<I>disgusting,</I> or the stronger adjectives given above, for the latter
meaning, would make the sentence clear.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Unexampled</B>

<P>
Such adjectives as <I>unexampled, unparalleled, unprecedented,</I> do not
admit of comparison, hence such expressions as <I>the most unexampled
</I>bravery, <I>the most unparalleled heroism,</I> etc., should be avoided.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Utter</B>

<P>
This verb should be distinguished from <I>express</I> or <I>say. Utter
</I>carries with it the idea of articulate expression, except in the sense
of <I>uttering</I> false coins or forged notes.
<P>
As an adjective it is defined by <I>complete, perfect, absolute,</I> etc.,
but it can be applied only to what is unpleasant or unfavorable. "I enjoyed
<I>utter</I> happiness" would be an absurd expression, but "I was doomed
to <I>utter</I> misery" illustrates a proper use of the word.

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Valuable, Valued</B>

"The train came to a standstill <I>right</I> here." Better, "The train stopped

"I heard of your misfortune, and came to you <I>right away."</I> "John, post
this letter for me <I>right off." Directly</I> or <I>immediately,</I> in

<P>
"James is <I>right</I> sick, and the doctor comes to see him <I>right

<P>
Few persons can claim to be entirely free from slips of speech in the use

as,

<PRE>
   I shall read,        We shall read,
   You will read,       You will read,
   He will read,        They will read.
</PRE>
<P>
But when I desire to show determination on my part to do a certain thing,
or when I exercise my authority over another, or express promise, command,
or threat, <I>will</I> is used in the first person and <I>shall</I> in the
second and third; as,
<PRE>   I will read,         We will read,
   You shall read,      You shall read,
   He shall read,       They shall read.
</PRE>
<P>
<I>Shall</I> primarily implies obligation; <I>will</I> implies intention
or purpose. <I>Will</I> and <I>would</I> should be used whenever the subject
names the one whose will controls the action; <I>shall</I> and <I>should</I>
must be employed whenever the one named by the subject is under the control
of another.
<P>
The difference between <I>should</I> and <I>would</I> is, in general, about
the same as that between <I>shall</I> and <I>will.</I>
<P>
The foregoing suggestions cover the ordinary uses of these auxiliaries, but
there are some special cases deserving attention.
<P>
<I>Will,</I> in the first person, expresses assent or promise, as well as
determination; as,
<P>
"I will read this poem for you since you have requested it."
<P>
  <HR>
102
<P>
"I will meet you to-morrow at the time appointed."
<P>
<I>Will,</I> in the second person, may express a command; as,
<P>
"You will take the places assigned you."
<P>
"You will report immediately at my office."
<P>
<I>Will</I> is sometimes employed to express a general fact, without conveying
the idea of futurity; as, "Accidents will happen." "Differences will arise."
<P>
<I>Will</I> is sometimes incorrectly used instead of <I>shall;</I> as,
<I>"Will</I> I go?" for <I>"Shall</I> I go?" This fault is common in Scotland,
and prevails to some extent in this country.

<I>Will</I> is also used where <I>may</I> would be more appropriate; as,
"Be that as it <I>will."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Shall you? Will you?</B>

<P>
The distinction between <I>shall</I> and <I>will</I> in the interrogative
forms of the second person are not very clearly defined. Many writers and
speakers use them interchangeably. The answer should have the same auxiliary
as the question.

<I>Should</I> and <I>would</I> are employed to express a conditional assertion;

"He <I>would</I> have gone fishing, if his father had been willing."
<P>
<I>Would</I> is often used to express a custom, a determination, or a wish;

states that, as a formative, <I>talented</I> is just as analogical and legitimate
as <I>gifted, bigoted, moneyed, lauded, lilied, honeyed,</I> and numerous
other adjectives having a participial form, but derived directly from nouns
and not from verbs.
<P>
We must therefore conclude that the use of <I>talented</I> as an adjective
is entirely legitimate.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Climb down</B>

<P>
The critics generally oppose the use of the expression <I>climb down. </I>When
the verb is employed without
<P>
  <HR>
104
<P align=justify class=full>
its adverbial modifier, the upward direction is always understood. In figurative
language, as "Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day," "The general
climbed the heights of fame," the upward direction is also understood.
<P>
But in a specific sense <I>climb</I> is defined "to mount laboriously, especially
by the use of hands and feet." Here the manner seems to be as important as
the direction. When the same manner must be employed in descending, as a
tree, a mast, or a steep, rocky cliff, the general term <I>descend</I> fails
to convey the meaning, and to use <I>slip, slide, drop, tumble, fall,</I>
would be incorrect. We are then left to choose between the short and clear,
but objectionable, expression <I>climb down</I> and some long and cumbersome
equivalent.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Mighty</B>

<P>
Never use <I>mighty</I> in the sense of <I>very,</I> or <I>exceedingly.</I>
It is not only inappropriate but inelegant.
<p class=center align=center>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Partake</B>

<P>
This word means <I>to take a part of, to share with</I> another. It is often
incorrectly used for <I>ate,</I> as "He <I>partook</I> sparingly of the food."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Powerful sight</B>

<P>
This is a Westernism to be avoided. It is used indiscriminately for a <I>large

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Apprehend, Comprehend</B>

<P>
To <I>apprehend</I> is to take into the mind; to <I>comprehend</I> is to

which we do not <I>comprehend.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Introduce, Present</B>

<P>
<I>Present</I> implies more formality than <I>introduce.</I> We introduce

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Seldom or ever</B>

<P>
This incorrect expression is sometimes used instead of <I>seldom or never

  <B>Sewage, Sewerage</B>

These words have distinct meanings. <I>Sewage</I> refers to the contents

  <B>Sociable, Social</B>

<P>
"He is one of the most <I>sociable</I> men I have met. He is fond of society,
and is very ready in conversation." <I>Sociable</I> means companionable;
<I>social</I> applies to the relations of men in society; as <I>social
</I>duties, <I>social</I> pleasures, <I>social</I> interests.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Specialty, Speciality</B>

<P>
These words are interchangeable, but the former is the better word.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Requirement, Requisition, Requisite</B>

<P>
While these words have something in common, each has a meaning peculiar to
itself. <I>Requirement</I>
<P>
  <HR>
107
<P align=justify class=full>
means that which is required as an essential condition, or as something
necessary; <I>requisition,</I> that which is required as of right, a demand
or application made as by authority; <I>requisite,</I> that which is required
by the nature of things, or by circumstances, that which cannot be dispensed
with. "She understood the nature of the child and of its
<I>requirements."</I> "The officer made a <I>requisition</I> for more troops."
"This is as much a <I>requisite</I> as food and clothing."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Sick, Ill</B>

<P>
There is a growing tendency to discriminate between <I>sickness </I>and
<I>illness,</I> limiting the words <I>sick</I> and <I>sickness</I> to some
slight disturbance of the physical system, as nausea, and applying the words
<I>ill</I> and <I>illness</I> to protracted disease and disordered health.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Scholar, Pupil</B>

<P>
Although these words are often used synonymously and with good authority,
it would be better to limit the former to learned persons and to apply the
latter to persons under instruction.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Commenced to write</B>

<P>
"I <I>commenced to write</I> at a very early age." After the verb
<I>commence</I> the best writers use the verbal
<P>
  <HR>
108
<P align=justify class=full>
noun instead of the infinitive with <I>to;</I> as, "I <I>commenced writing
</I>at a very early age."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Beside, Besides</B>

<P>
These words were formerly used interchangeably, but the best writers of to-day
make a distinction. <I>Beside</I> means by <I>the side of. Besides </I>means
<I>in addition to. Besides</I> is sometimes incorrectly used for
<I>except;</I> as, "No trees will grow here <I>besides</I> the pine."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Bountiful, Plentiful</B>

<P>
<I>Bountiful</I> applies to the giver; <I>plentiful</I> to the things furnished.
"The <I>bountiful</I> Giver of all good furnishes a <I>plentiful </I>supply
of all things needful for our comfort and happiness." Do not say a
<I>bountiful</I> repast, a <I>bountiful</I> harvest.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Attacked, Burst, Drowned</B>

<P>
The incorrect past tense forms <I>attackted, bursted, drownded,</I> are sometimes
heard; as, "The cashier was <I>attackted</I> by three of the ruffians," "The
cannon <I>bursted</I> and killed the gunners,"" The fishermen were
<I>drownded</I> off the bar." Use <I>attacked, burst, drowned.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>All</B>

<P>
This little word is used in a great many ways, some of which are quite
colloquial, and in some cases provincial. When the grocer's clerk has taken
your order he is prompted to say, "Is that <I>all?"</I> Or if
<P>
  <HR>
109
<P align=justify class=full>
he should say, "Is there anything else that you wish?" you are likely to
reply, "No; that is <I>all."</I> Whether used in the question or in the reply,
the word <I>all</I> should be avoided, or else the expression should be expanded
so as to make a clear sentence.
<P>
A friend calls to see you, and, finding you alone when he expected to meet
others with you, he says, "Good morning; I see you are <I>all</I> alone."
<I>All</I> is not a good equivalent for <I>quite</I> or <I>entirely,</I>
either of which words would be better than <I>all.</I> In truth, the sentence
is as clear and as strong and more concise without the use of a modifier.
"I see you are <I>alone."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Inaugurate</B>

<P>
<I>To inaugurate</I> means <I>to induct</I> into office or <I>to set in
motion</I> with formality and serious ceremony. Pompous writers too often
employ the word in referring to commonplace events. A new business is
<I>established.</I> A new hall or library is <I>opened.</I> A new pastor
is <I>installed.</I> A new order of procedure is <I>adopted.</I> In general,
the word <I>begin</I> or <I>commence</I> would be more appropriate than
<I>inaugurate.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Came across, Met with</B>

<P>
"I <I>came across</I> the passage quite unexpectedly." Better, "I <I>chanced

unexpectedly."
<P>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Expect</B>

Few words are more frequently incorrectly used than <I>expect. "</I>I
<I>expect</I> you went to town yesterday," "I <I>expect</I> you will hear
from me to-morrow," "I <I>expect</I> the train has arrived," represent some
of the uses to which this word is often put. <I>Expect</I> refers wholly
to the future, and should not refer to present or past events; as, "I <I>expect
</I>you to write me from Liverpool." "John <I>expects</I> to see his father
to-morrow." Among the expressions that can most readily and appropriately
be substituted for <I>expect</I> are <I>suspect, suppose, think, believe,
presume, daresay.</I>

"After the supper was <I>over with</I> the guests departed." Omit

  <B>Overflown</B>

<P>
"The lowlands along the river are <I>overflown."</I> Use <I>overflowed. </I>The

<I>overflown.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Good piece</B>

"I have come a <I>good piece</I> to see you." Say "I have come a <I>long

  <B>No more than I could help</B>

<P>
"As I was not in sympathy with the cause, I gave <I>no more than I could
help."</I> So accustomed are we to hearing this awkward, blundering expression
that we readily understand the meaning it is intended to convey, and should
be sorely puzzled to interpret the correct form. Let us analyze it. I gave
five dollars. That much I could not help (giving). I gave no more. Hence,
"I gave no more than I could not help." This last form appears to be correct.
By changing the phraseology the sentence can be greatly improved. "I gave
no more than I felt compelled to give." "I made my contribution as small
as possible." "My gift was limited to the measure of my sense of obligation."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Above, More than, Preceding</B>

<P>
"It is <I>above</I> a week since I heard from my brother." We may say
<I>"above</I> the earth," <I>"above</I> the housetops," but in the preceding
sentence it is better to say, "It is <I>more than</I> a week since I heard
from my brother."
<P>
"In the <I>above</I> paragraph he quotes from Horace." Say, "In the
<I>preceding</I> or <I>foregoing</I> paragraph," etc. The awkwardness of

it occurs is found at the top of a page, and the passage

  <B>Climax</B>

<P>
The Greek word <I>climax</I> means literally <I>a</I> <I>ladder, </I>and
implies <I>ascent, upward movement.</I> The best authors use it only in this
sense, and not to denote the highest point.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Factor</B>

<P>
This word, from the Latin <I>factor,</I> a doer, an agent, signifies

<P align=justify class=full>
<I>healthy</I> or <I>unhealthy</I> according as it possesses vigor. Food,

  <B>Alone, Only</B>

<P>
"An <I>only</I> child" is one that has neither brother nor sister. "A child
<I>alone"</I> is one that is left to itself. "Virtue <I>alone</I> makes us
happy" means that virtue unaccompanied by any other advantages is sufficient
to make us happy. "Virtue <I>only</I> makes us happy" means that nothing
else can do it.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Grow, Raise, Rear</B>

<P>
"We <I>grow</I> wheat, corn, oats, and potatoes on our farm." "We
<I>raise</I> wheat," etc., would be better. With the same propriety we might
use <I>sleep</I> for <I>lodge,</I> and <I>eat</I> for <I>feed,</I> or supply
with food; as, "We can <I>eat</I> and <I>sleep</I> fifty persons at one time."
<P>
The word <I>raise</I> is often incorrectly used in the sense of <I>rear;
</I>as, "She <I>raised</I> a family of nine children." It is sometimes employed
in the sense of <I>increase,</I> as, "The landlord <I>raised</I> my<I>

  <B>Badly, Greatly</B>

<I>Badly</I> is often incorrectly used for <I>greatly</I> or <I>very much,</I>

"That fence wants painting <I>badly,</I> I think I'll do it myself," said

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>At you</B>

<P>
"If you don't stop teasing me I will do something <I>at</I> you," meaning
"I will punish you." That form of expression is very common in some localities,
and it is even more inelegant than common. The use of the preposition
<I>to</I> instead of <I>at</I> would be a slight improvement, but the sentence
should be entirely recast.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Haply, Happily</B>

<P>
In the reading of the Scriptures the word <I>happily</I> is sometimes used
where the archaic word <I>haply</I> should be employed. In like manner the

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Got to</B>

  <B>Could, Can, Will</B>

<I>Could</I> is often incorrectly employed where <I>can</I> or <I>will</I>

<I>"Could</I> you lend me a dollar this morning?" If the thought of the inquirer

<I>Pretty</I> is often incorrectly used in the sense of <I>very </I>or

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Lot, Number</B>

The use of <I>lot</I> for <I>number</I> or <I>many</I> is a colloquialism

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Lead a dance</B>

<P>
"He <I>led</I> his companion <I>a fine dance."</I> This expression, as generally
used, is ironical, and implies that the leader conducts those who are led
through experiences unfamiliar to them and usually to their disadvantage.
To lead astray, to deceive, to corrupt the morals of, may be substituted
for the foregoing inelegant expression.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Try and</B>

<P>
"Have you been to the country this summer?" "No; but I will <I>try and go
</I>next week.". The second speaker intends to convey the idea that it is
his purpose to go if nothing occurs to prevent, but his going is still a
matter of uncertainty. His statement, however, when properly interpreted
means that he not only will try, but that he positively will go.
<P>
"Try <I>and</I> finish that work to-day." Here the purpose is not to command
that the work shall be finished, but that the trial shall be made. As the
sentence stands two distinct commands are given, first, that the trial shall
be made, and, second, that the work must be completed. The sentence should
read, "Try to finish that work to-day."
<P>
Use <I>to</I> instead of <I>and</I> in such expressions as "Try <I>and </I>make
it convenient to come," "Try <I>and</I> do your work properly," "Try

<h3>  CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4>  <B>Contractions</B></h4>
<P>
Whatever may be said against employing contractions in dignified discourse,
their use in colloquial speech is too firmly established to justify our censure.
But, in their use, as, indeed, in the use of all words, proper discrimination
must be shown.
<P>
Just why <I>haven't, hasn't, doesn't, isn't, wasn't,</I> are regarded as
being in good repute, and <I>ain't, weren't, mightn't, oughtn't,</I> are
regarded with less favor, and why <I>shalln't, willn't</I> are absolutely
excluded, it would be difficult to explain.
<P>
<I>Use determines the law of language,</I> whether for single words, grammatical
forms, or grammatical constructions. Wherever a people, by common consent,
employ a particular word to mean a certain thing, that word becomes an inherent
part of the language of that people, whether it has any basis in etymology
or not. We must not wrest this law to our own convenience, however, by assuming
that such words and phrases as are introduced and employed by the illiterate,
or even by the educated, within a circumscribed territory, are, therefore,
to be regarded as
<P>
  <HR>
119
<P align=justify class=full>
reputable words. The sanction of all classes, the educated as well as the
uneducated, throughout the entire country in which the language is spoken,
is necessary and preliminary to the proper introduction of a new word into
the language.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Ain't</B>

<P>
This word is a contraction of <I>am</I> <I>not</I> or <I>are not, </I>and
can, therefore, be used only with the singular pronouns <I>I</I> and
<I>you</I>, and with the plural pronouns <I>we, you,</I> and <I>they,</I>
and with nouns in the plural.
<P>
I <I>am not</I> pleased. I <I>ain't</I> pleased.
<P>
You <I>are not</I> kind. You <I>ain't</I> kind.
<P>
They <I>are not</I> gentlemen. They <I>ain't</I> gentlemen.
<P>
These sentences will serve to illustrate the proper use of <I>ain't,</I>
if it is ever proper to use such an inelegant word as that. "James
<I>ain't</I> a good student," "Mary <I>ain't</I> a skillful musician," or
"This orange <I>ain't</I> sweet," are expressions frequently heard, yet those
who use them would be shocked to hear the same expressions with the proper
equivalent <I>am not</I> or <I>are not</I> substituted for the misleading
<I>ain't.</I>
<P>
The expression <I>ain't</I> is compounded of the verb <I>am</I> or <I>are</I>
and the adverb <I>not,</I> and by the contraction the three vocal impulses
<I>I-am-not,</I> or <I>you-are-not,</I> or <I>they-are-not,</I> are reduced
to two. By compounding the pronoun with the verb and preserving the full
adverb,
<P>
  <HR>
120
<P align=justify class=full>
as in "<I>I'm not," "You're not,"</I> "<I>They're not,"</I> we also reduce
the three vocal impulses to two, thus securing as short a contraction in
sound and one that is as fully adapted to colloquial speech, and that is,
at the same time, in much better taste.
<P>
The old form for <I>ain't</I> was <I>an't,</I> but this has now become obsolete.
It will be a blessing to the English-speaking people when the descendant
shall sleep with his father.
<P>
<I>Are not</I> is sometimes contracted into <I>aren't,</I> but this form
has not found much favor.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Can't and Couldn't</B>

<P>
As <I>cannot</I> and <I>could not</I> may be used with pronouns of the first,
second, or third person, in either number, and with nouns in both numbers,
no error is likely to follow the use of their contracted forms.
<P>
Why <I>cannot</I> is properly written as one word, and <I>could not
</I>requires two, is not founded upon any principle of philosophy. The concurrent
sanction of all classes in all parts of the English-speaking world establishes
it as law.
<P>
Observe that the <I>a</I> in the verb <I>can't</I> is broader in sound than
the <I>short a</I> in the noun <I>cant.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Don't and Didn't</B>

<P>
<I>Don't</I> is a contraction of <I>do not.</I> It is in very general use
and in good repute. It may be employed
<P>
  <HR>
121
<P align=justify class=full>
wherever the expanded expression <I>do not</I> could be applied, and only
there.
<P>
"One swallow <I>don't</I> make a spring" is equivalent to saying, "One swallow
<I>do not</I> make a spring." We may say "<I>I don't," "You don't," "We don't,"
"They don't," "The men</I> (or <I>birds,</I> or <I>trees) don't,"</I> but
we must use <I>doesn't</I> with <I>he,</I> or <I>she,</I> or <I>it,</I> or
<I>the man, the grove, the cloud,</I> etc.
<P>
Unlike the verb <I>do</I>, its past tense form <I>did</I> undergoes no change
in conjugation, hence the contraction <I>didn't</I> is also uniform.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Haven't, Hasn't, and Hadn't</B>

<P>
The verb <I>have,</I> like the verb <I>do,</I> has a distinct form for the
third person singular. The same change affects the contraction. I
<I>haven't,</I> you <I>haven't,</I> he <I>hasn't.</I> The construction
<I>hadn't</I> undergoes no change.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Haint, Taint</B>

<P>
<I>Haint</I> is used indiscriminately for <I>haven't</I> and <I>hasn't.
Taint</I> is used for <I>tisn't.</I> Their use is indicative of an entire
lack of culture.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Isn't</B>

<P>
No one need hesitate to use this word. It is smooth in utterance and contributes
much to the freedom and ease of social intercourse. Its equivalent is too
stately for colloquial forms of speech, and is often
<P>
  <HR>
122
<P align=justify class=full>
suggestive of pedantry. Compare <I>"Isn't</I> he an eloquent speaker?"
"<I>Isn't</I> this a beautiful flower?" with <I>"Is not</I> he an eloquent
speaker?" "<I>Is</I> this <I>not</I> a beautiful flower?"
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Wasn't</B>

<P>
Although not so elegant as the present tense form <I>isn't,</I> yet the
contraction <I>wasn't</I> is in excellent repute. It is properly used only
in the first and third persons singular. No one who makes any pretension
to culture would be guilty of saying" You <I>was</I> my neighbor, but you
<I>wasn't</I> my friend," "We <I>was</I> engaged in trade, and they <I>wasn't
</I>of any use to us." Say we <I>were</I> or <I>were not,</I> but never
<I>wasn't</I> or <I>wa'nt.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Weren't</B>

<P>
The forms <I>aren't,</I> and <I>weren't</I> do not have the sanction of the
best speakers and writers, and should be used sparingly, if at all.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Shouldn't and Wouldn't</B>

<P>
These are frequently used in speech, but are not so common in writing.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Mustn't, Mayn't, Mightn't, and Oughtn't</B>

<P>
<I>Mustn't</I> may be used in light conversation, but not in writing. The
others should be avoided in speech and writing.
<P>
  <HR>
123
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>I'm, You're, He's, She's, It's, We're, They're</B>

<P>
The contractions formed by compounding the pronoun with the verb are very
common, and tend to preserve conversation from becoming stiff and formal.
Nouns in the singular are sometimes compounded in like manner; as, "John's
going by the early train," "Mary's caught a bird." Not many verbs beside
<I>is</I> and <I>has</I> are thus compounded, and the practice should be
discouraged.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Mayst, Mightst</B>

<P>
Although <I>mayst, canst, mightst, couldst, wouldst,</I> and <I>shouldst</I>
are contracted forms, the apostrophe is not employed to indicate the contraction.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Daren't, Dursent</B>

<P>
<I>Dare not</I> is sometimes contracted to <I>daren't</I> and <I>durst not</I>
to<I> dursent,</I> but the practice should not be encouraged.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Let's</B>

<P>
While verbs are often contracted when compounded with pronouns, as <I>it's,
he's, I'm, you're,</I> etc., the pronoun must not be contracted to form a
combination with the verb. It may be a poor rule, but it will not work both
ways. <I>Let's</I> should therefore be <I>let us.</I>
<P>

<h3>  CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4> <B>Possessive Case</B></h4>

<P>
Some time ago a shoe merchant called upon the writer to know how to arrange
the points in the wording of a new sign that he was preparing to place over
his door. He made a specialty of shoes for men and boys. He presented a paper
containing the lines:
<p class=center align=center>
  Men's and Boy's Shoes.<BR>
  Mens' and Boys' Shoes.

<P>
He was politely informed that both were incorrect; that the two words form
their plurals differently, and that the possessive case is, therefore, formed
in a different manner. The plural of <I>man</I> is <I>men,;</I> the plural
of <I>boy</I> is <I>boys</I>. The possessive of <I>man</I> is <I>man's;</I>
of <I>men</I> is <I>men's.</I> The possessive of <I>boy</I> is <I>boy's;</I>
of <I>boys</I> is <I>boys'.</I> In the latter case we are obliged to place
the apostrophe after the <I>s</I> in order to distinguish the possessive
plural from the possessive singular. All nouns that form their plurals by
adding <I>s</I> to the singular, form their possessive case as the word <I>boy
</I>does. The sign should therefore read:
<p class=center align=center>
  Men's and Boys' Shoes.

<P>
  <HR>
125
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Singular Nouns</B>

<P>
All nouns in the singular form their possessive case by adding the apostrophe
and the letter <I>s</I>; as, child's, girl's, woman's, bird's, brother's,
sister's, judge's, sailor's.
<P>
When the noun ends in <I>s, sh, ch, ce, se,</I> or <I>x</I>, the additional
<I>s</I> makes another syllable in pronouncing the word; as, James's, Charles's,
witness's, duchess's, countess's, Rush's, March's, prince's, horse's, fox's.
In poetry the terminal <I>s</I> is sometimes omitted for the sake of the
meter.
<P>
While writers differ, the tendency in modern usage is toward the additional
<I>s</I> in such expressions as <I>Mrs. Hemans's Poems, Junius's Letters,
Knowles's "Virginius," Knox's Sermons, Brooks's Arithmetics, Rogers's
Essays.</I>
<P>
By long-established usage such expressions as <I>for conscience' sake, for
righteousness' sake, for qoodness' sake, for Jesus' sake,</I> have become
idioms. Some authorities justify the omission of the possessive <I>s</I>
when the next word begins with <I>s</I>, as in <I>Archimedes' screw, Achilles'
sword.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Plural Nouns</B>

<P>
Most nouns form their plurals by adding <I>s</I> or <I>es</I> to the singular.
These plurals form their possessive by adding the apostrophe; as, horses',
countesses', foxes', churches', princes'. Nouns whose plurals are formed
otherwise than by adding <I>s</I> or <I>es,</I> form their possessive
<P>
  <HR>
126
<P align=justify class=full>
case by adding the apostrophe and <I>s,</I> just as nouns in the singular
do; as, men's, women's, children's, seraphim's.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Pronouns</B>

<P>
Sometimes the mistake is made of using the apostrophe with the possessive
personal pronouns; as, her's, our's, it's. The personal and relative pronouns
do not require the apostrophe, but the indefinite pronouns <I>one</I> and
<I>other</I> form their possessives in the same manner as nouns; as, "<I>each
other's eyes," "a hundred others' woes."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Double Possessives</B>

<P>
"John and Mary's sled," means one sled belonging jointly to John and Mary.
"John's and Mary's sleds" means that one sled belongs to John, the other
to Mary.
<P>
"Men, women, and children's shoes for sale here." When several possessives
connected by <I>and</I> refer to the same noun, the sign of the possessive
is applied to the last one only.
<P>
When a disjunctive word or words are used, the sign must be annexed to each
word; as, "These are Charles's or James's books."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Possessive of Nouns in Apposition</B>

<P>
When two nouns are in apposition, or constitute a title, the possessive sign
is affixed to the last, as
<P>
  <HR>
127
<P align=justify class=full>
"For David my servant's sake," "Give me here John the Baptist's head in a
charger," "The Prince of Wales's yacht," "Frederick the Great's kindness."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After "of"</B>

<P>
By a peculiarity of idiom the possessive sign is used with a noun in the
objective; as, "This is a story <I>of Lincoln's,"</I> "That is a letter <I>of
the President's,"</I> "A patient <I>of Dr. Butler's,"</I> "A pupil <I>of
Professor Ludlam's."</I>
<P>
In ordinary prose the custom of the best writers is to limit the use of the
possessive chiefly to persons and personified objects; to time expressions,
as, <I>an hour's delay, a moment's thought;</I> and to such idioms as <I>for
brevity's sake.</I>
<P>
Avoid such expressions as, "America's champion baseball player," "Chicago's
best five-cent cigar," "Lake Michigan's swiftest steamer."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Somebody else's</B>

<P>
The question whether we should say "This is somebody's else pencil," or "This
is somebody else's pencil," has been warmly argued by the grammarians, the
newspapers, and the schools. If some leading journal or magazine were to
write somebody else as one word, others would, doubtless, follow, and the
question of the possessive would settle itself. The word
<I>notwithstanding</I> is composed of three separate words,
<P>
  <HR>
128
<P align=justify class=full>
which are no more closely united in thought than are the three words <I>some,
body,</I> and <I>else.</I> Two of the latter are already united, and the
close mental union of the third with the first and second would justify the
innovation.
<P>
But the words are at present disunited. A majority of the best writers still
conform to the old custom of placing the possessive with <I>else.</I>
<P>
"People were so ridiculous with their illusions, carrying their fool's caps
unawares, thinking their own lies opaque, while <I>everybody else's </I>were
transparent."&#8212; <I>George Eliot.</I>
<P>
Some make a distinction by placing the possessive with <I>else</I> when the
noun follows, and with <I>somebody</I> when the noun precedes; as, "This
is <I>somebody else's</I> pencil," and "This pencil is <I>somebody's else."
</I>This distinction is not generally followed.
<P>
  <HR>
129
<h3>  CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4>  <B>Pronouns</B></h4>

<P>
The correct use of the pronouns, personal and relative, involves a degree
of skill which many speakers and writers fail to possess. The choice of the
appropriate pronoun, the agreement with its antecedent, the proper case form,
are matters that require careful consideration.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Case Forms</B>

<P>
Following <I>am, are, is, was,</I> and other forms of the verb <I>to be,</I>
the pronoun must be in the nominative case.
<P>
"Are you the person that called?" "Yes; I am <I>him."</I> The answer should
have been, "I am <I>he."</I>
<P>
"I saw a man trespassing on my grounds, and I think you are <I>him." </I>Say,
"You are <I>he."</I>
<P>
"It is only <I>me;</I> don't be afraid." "It is only <I>I"</I> is the correct
form.
<P>
"It was <I>him</I> that struck you, not <I>me."</I> Change <I>him,</I> to
<I>he,</I> and <I>me</I> to <I>I.</I>
<P>
"It might have been <I>him</I> that sent you the present." Use <I>he, </I>not
<I>him.</I>
<P>
  <HR>
130
<P>
"It is <I>him whom</I> you said it was." The sentence should be, "It is <I>he
who</I> you said it was."
<P>
"That was but a picture of him and not <I>him</I> himself." Say, "and not
<I>he</I> himself."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After Verbs and Prepositions</B>

<P>
When a pronoun depends upon a verb or a preposition the pronoun must be in
the objective case.
<P>
"Between you and <I>I,</I> that picture is very faulty." The pronouns <I>you
</I>and <I>I</I> depend upon the preposition <I>between.</I> The pronoun
<I>I </I>should therefore be in the objective case, and the sentence should
be, "Between <I>you</I> and <I>me,</I> that picture is very faulty."
<P>
"The president of the meeting appointed <I>you</I> and <I>I</I> upon the
committee." As both pronouns are objects of the transitive verb <I>appointed,
</I>both should be in the objective case. <I>You</I> having the same form
in the objective as in the nominative is, therefore, correct, but <I>I</I>
should be changed to <I>me.</I>
<P>
"The teacher selected <I>he</I> and <I>I</I> to represent the class." The
pronouns are the objects of the verb <I>selected,</I> and should be changed
to <I>him</I> and <I>me.</I> The infinitive <I>to represent,</I> like other
infinitives, can have no subject, and, therefore, does not control the case
of the pronouns.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Interrogatives</B>

<P>
When a question is asked, the subject is usually placed after the verb, or
between the auxiliary and
<P>
  <HR>
131
<P align=justify class=full>
the verb; as, "Did you go to town?" "Will he sail to-day?" "Has your uncle
arrived?" "Hearest thou thy mother's call?"
<P>
The object or attribute of the verb, when a pronoun, is often used to introduce
the sentence. "<I>Who</I> should I see coming toward me but my old friend?"
<I>Who</I> should be <I>whom,</I> for it is the object, and not the subject,
of the verb <I>should see.</I>
<P>
<I>"Whom</I> do you think that tall gentleman is?" <I>Whom</I> should be
<I>who,</I> as it is the attribute of the verb <I>is.</I>
<P>
"<I>Who</I> do you take me for?" Being the object of the preposition <I>for,
who</I> should be <I>whom.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After "To be"</B>

<P>
"I knew it was <I>him"</I> is incorrect, because the word which forms the
pronoun attribute of the verb <I>was</I> must be in the nominative case.
But the infinitive of the neuter verb requires the objective case. Therefore
we must say, "I knew it to be <I>him,"</I> not "I knew it to be <I>he."</I>
The latter faulty form is very frequently employed.
<P>
"<I>Who</I> did you suppose it to be?" Incorrect. Say, <I>"whom."</I>
<P>
<I>"Whom</I> did you suppose it was?" Incorrect. Say, <I>"who."</I>
<P>
  <HR>
132
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After the Imperative</B>

<P>
The imperative mood requires the objective case after it. "Let you and
<I>I</I> try it." It should be, "Let you and <I>me</I> try it."
<P>
"Let <I>he</I> who made thee answer that."&#8212; <I>Byron.</I> He should have
said, "Let <I>him</I> who made thee answer that."
<P>
"Let <I>him</I> be <I>whom,</I> he may." <I>Him</I> is the objective after
the imperative <I>let,</I> and is correct. <I>Whom</I> should be <I>who,</I>
as pronoun attribute of the verb <I>may be.</I> "<I>Who</I> he may be, I
cannot tell," is correct. "<I>Who</I> he may be, let him be," is also correct.
By transposing, and by omitting <I>be,</I> we have "Let him be <I>who</I>
he may."
<P>
"Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and <I>they</I> that
dwell therein." When, as in this case, the verb is widely separated from
its object, we need to give particular care to the case of the pronoun which
constitutes the object. <I>They</I> should be <I>them.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Silent Predicate</B>

<P>
"Who will go with us to the woods? <I>Me."</I> The complete answer would
be," Me will go with you to the woods," the faultiness of which is evident.
The answer should be "<I>I."</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After "Than" and "As"</B>

<P>
The objective pronoun is often incorrectly used for the nominative after
<I>than</I> or <I>as</I>.
<P>
  <HR>
133
<P>
"He can swim better <I>than me."</I> The complete sentence would be, "He
can swim better than <I>I</I> can swim." The omission of the verb <I>can
swim </I>affords no reason for changing <I>I</I> to <I>me.</I>
<P>
"He is no better than <I>me."</I> Say, "He is no better than <I>I,"
</I>meaning, <I>I am.</I>
<P>
"They are common people, such as you and <I>me</I>." Such people "as you
and I are." The pronoun should be <I>I,</I> not <I>me.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Parenthetical Expressions</B>

<P>
When a parenthetical expression comes between a pronoun in the nominative
case and its verb, the objective is often incorrectly used instead of the
nominative.
<P>
"She sang for the benefit of those <I>whom</I> she thought might be interested."
The explanatory parenthesis <I>"she thought"</I> comes between the pronominal
subject and its verb <I>might be interested.</I> Omit the explanatory clause
and the case of the pronoun becomes clear. "She sang for the benefit of those
<I>who</I> might be interested."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Agreement with Antecedent</B>

<P>
A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in <I>gender, person,</I> and
<I>number.</I> The gender and person usually take care of themselves, but
the number of pronouns is a serious obstacle to correct speech.
<P>
  <HR>
134
<P>
"One tells the quality of <I>their</I> minds when <I>they</I> try to talk
well"&#8212; <I>George Eliot,</I> in <I>Middlemarch.</I> The pronouns <I>their
</I>and <I>they</I> should be singular.
<P>
"Everybody has something to say which <I>they think</I> is worthy of being
heard." <I>Everybody</I> refers to persons singly, and not collectively.
<I>They think</I> should be <I>he thinks, he</I> being the proper pronoun
to employ when the gender is not indicated.
<P>
"Every nation has laws and customs of <I>their</I> own." The use of the word
<I>every</I> necessitates a pronoun in the singular, hence <I>their</I> should
be <I>its.</I>
<P>
"Every one is accountable for <I>their</I> own acts." Use <I>his.</I>
<P>
"She studied his countenance like an inscription, and deciphered <I>each</I>
rapt expression that crossed it, and stored <I>them</I> in her memory." Change
<I>them</I> to <I>it.</I>
<P>
"Each of them, in <I>their</I> turn, received the reward to which <I>they
were</I> entitled." This should be "Each of them in <I>his</I> turn received
the reward to which <I>he was</I> entitled."
<P>
<I>No</I> and <I>not,</I> like <I>each</I> and <I>every,</I> when they qualify
a plural antecedent, or one consisting of two or more nouns, require a pronoun
in the singular.
<P>
"No policeman, no employee, no citizen dared to lift <I>their</I> hand" Say,
<I>his</I> hand.
<P>
  <HR>
135
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Or, Nor</B>

<P>
When the antecedent consists of two or more nouns separated by <I>or, nor,
as well as,</I> or any other disjunctive, the pronoun must be singular.
<P>
"Neither spelling nor parsing <I>receive</I> the attention <I>they</I> once
received." Verb and pronoun should be singular, <I>receives</I> and
<I>it.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Collective Noun</B>

<P>
When a noun of multitude or collective noun is the antecedent, the pronoun,
like the verb, must be plural or singular according to the sense intended
to be conveyed.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Ambiguity</B>

<P>
Never leave the antecedent of your pronoun in doubt.
<P>
"John tried to see his father in the crowd, but could not, because <I>he
</I>was so short." If the father was short, repeat the noun and omit the
pronoun, as "John tried to see his father in the crowd but could not because
his father was so short." If John was short, recast the sentence: "John,
being short of stature, tried in vain to see his father in the crowd."
<P>
"He said to his friend that, if he did not feel better soon, he thought he
had better go home." This sentence is susceptible of four interpretations.
We shall omit the first part of the sentence in the last
<P>
  <HR>
136
<P align=justify class=full>
three interpretations, as it is the same in all. "He said to his friend:
'If I do not feel better soon, I think I had better go home.'" "If I do not
feel better soon, I think you had better go home." "If you do not feel better
soon, I think I had better go home." "If you do not feel better soon, I think
you had better go home."
<P>
"The lad cannot leave his father; for, if he should leave <I>him, he</I>
would die." To avoid ambiguity substitute <I>his father</I> for the italicised
pronouns. The repetition is not pleasant, but it is the lesser of two evils.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Needless Pronouns</B>

<P>
Avoid all pronouns and other words that are not essential to the meaning.
<P>
"The father <I>he</I> died, the mother <I>she</I> soon followed <I>after,
</I>and the children <I>they</I> were <I>all</I> taken <I>down</I> sick."
<P>
"Let every one turn from <I>his or her</I> evil ways." Unless there is special
reason for emphasizing the feminine pronoun, avoid the awkward expression
<I>his or her.</I> The pronoun <I>his</I> includes the other.

  <B>Mixed Pronouns</B>

<P>
Do not use two styles of the pronoun in the same Sentence. "Enter <I>thou</I>
into the joy of <I>your</I> Lord." "Love <I>thyself</I> last, and others
will love <I>you</I>."
<P>
  <HR>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Them, Those</B>

<P>
It should not be necessary to caution the reader against the use of <I>them
</I>for <I>those.</I>
<P>
"Fetch me <I>them</I> books." "Did you see <I>them,</I> fat oxen?"
"<I>Them's</I> good; I'll take another dish."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Which, Who</B>

<P>
"Those <I>which</I> say so are mistaken." <I>Who</I> is applied to persons;
<I>which,</I> to the lower animals and to inanimate things.
<P>
"He has some friends <I>which</I> I know." <I>Whom,</I> the objective case
form of the pronoun <I>who,</I> should here be used.
<P>
"The dog, <I>who</I> was called Rover, went mad." Use <I>which.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>What, That</B>

<P>
<I>That</I> is applied to persons, animals, and things. <I>What </I>is applied
to things. The antecedent of <I>what</I> should not be expressed. <I>What</I>
is both antecedent and relative.
<P>
"All <I>what</I> he saw he described." Say, "What he saw," or "All <I>that
</I>he saw," etc.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Uniform Relatives</B>

<P>
When several relative clauses relate to the same antecedent, they should
have the same relative pronoun.
<P>
"It was Joseph <I>that</I> was sold into Egypt, who became
<P>
  <HR>
138
<P align=justify class=full>
governor of the land, and <I>which</I> saved his father and brothers from
famine." Change <I>that</I> and <I>which</I> to <I>who</I>.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Choice of Relatives</B>

<P>
Since <I>who</I> and <I>that</I> are both applied to persons, and
<I>which</I> and <I>that</I> are both applied to animals and things, it often
becomes a serious question which relative we shall employ. Much has been
written upon the subject, but the critics still differ in theory and in practice.
The following is probably as simple a statement of the general rule as can
be found:
<P>
If the relative clause is of such a nature that it could be introduced by
<I>and he, and she, and it, and they,</I> etc., the relative <I>who</I> (for
persons) and <I>which</I> (for animals or things) should be used in preference
to the relative <I>that.</I>
<P>
"Man <I>that</I> is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble."
The language of the Bible and of Shakespeare must stand, although the forms
of expression differ greatly from those employed at the present day. According
to modern standards, <I>that</I> should be <I>who.</I>
<P>
"The earth is enveloped by an ocean of air <I>that</I> is a compound of oxygen
and nitrogen!" Change <I>that</I> to <I>which</I>.
<P>
The relative <I>that</I> should be used in preference to <I>who</I> or
<I>which:</I>

  <B>Adverbs for Relative Pronouns</B>

<P>
Adverbs are often employed where a preposition with a relative pronoun would
better express the sense.
<P>
"There is no method known <I>how</I> his safety may be assured." Use <I>by
which</I> instead of <I>how.</I>

"He wrote me a letter <I>where</I> he repeated his instructions." "Letter
<I>in which</I> he repeated," etc.

"And curse the country <I>where</I> their fathers dwelt." <I>"In which
</I>their fathers dwelt."
<P>
"This is a case <I>where</I> large interests are involved." The preposition

</I>large interests are involved."

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Misplaced Relative</B>

<h3>  CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h4>  <B>Number</B></h4>

<P>
Many persons of moderate education regard nouns that do not end with <I>s</I>
or <I>es</I> as singular. Even the gifted pen of Addison once slipped so
far as to betray him into using the word <I>seraphim,</I> in the singular.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Cherubim, Seraphim</B>

<P>
The words <I>cherub</I> and <I>seraph,</I> are singular. <I>Cherub, </I>as
applied to a little child, takes the English plural, <I>cherubs.</I> As applied
to an order of angels, it takes the Hebrew plural, <I>cherubim.</I> The singular,
<I>seraph,</I> has an English plural, <I>seraphs,</I> as well as the Hebrew
plural, <I>seraphs.</I> The double plurals, <I>cherubims</I> and
<I>seraphims,</I> although found in the King James version of the Bible,
are regarded as faulty in modern writing, and should be avoided.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>News</B>

Although plural in form, the word <I>news</I> is singular in meaning; as,
"The <I>news</I> from Europe this morning is quite interesting."

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Acoustics</B>

<P>
Names of sciences ending in <I>ics,</I> are generally regarded as singular.
<I>"Acoustics</I> is a very considerable branch of physics." Do not say,
"The <I>acoustics</I> of this hall <I>are</I> good," but "The <I>acoustic</I>
<I>properties</I> of this hall are good."
<P>
Dialectics, dynamics, economics, mathematics, ethics, politics, tactics,
when used as substantives, require a verb in the singular.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Analysis</B>

<P>
Many words like <I>analysis, crisis, ellipsis, emphasis, hypothesis, oasis,
parenthesis, synopsis,</I> form their plurals by changing the termination
<I>is</I> into <I>es;</I> as, <I>analyses, crises,</I> etc. The word <I>iris
</I>takes the English plural <I>irises;</I> Latin plural is <I>irides.
Chrysalis</I> has only the Latin plural, <I>chrysalides;</I> but <I>chrysalid,
</I>which means the same as <I>chrysalis,</I> takes the English plural,
<I>chrysalids.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Terminus</B>

<P>
<I>Terminus, radius, alumnus,</I> and some other words ending in <I>us</I>,
form their plurals by changing the termination <I>us</I> into <I>i</I>; as
<I>termini, radii,</I> etc.
<P>
Many words ending in <I>us</I> that formerly were written with only the Latin
plural, are now given an English plural also; as, <I>focuses, foci; cactuses,
cacti; sarcophaguses, sarcophagi; convolvuluses, convolvuli ; funguses, fungi;
nucleuses, nuclei.</I>
<P>
  <HR>

<P>
<I>Isthmus, prospectus, rebus,</I> take only the English plural.
<P>
<I>Apparatus</I> has no plural. Avoid <I>apparatuses.</I>
<P>
The plural of <I>genius,</I> as applied to a man of unusual vigor of mind,
is <I>geniuses.</I> When applied to a good or bad spirit, the plural is
<I>genii.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Formula</B>

<P>
<I>Formulas, larvas, stigmas,</I> are regular English plurals; <I>formulae,
larvae,</I> and <I>stigmata</I> are the classical plurals. <I>Nebulae</I>
and <I>alumnae</I> are the proper plurals, the latter being the feminine
noun corresponding to the masculine plural <I>alumni.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Datum, Phenomenon</B>

<P>
<I>Datum, erratum, candelabrum,</I> and <I>memorandum</I> form their plurals
by changing <I>um</I> to <I>a</I>; as, <I>data, errata,</I> etc. The last
two also take the English plurals, <I>memorandums, candelabrums.</I>
<P>
The plural of <I>phenomenon</I> and <I>criterion</I> are <I>phenomena,
criteria,</I> although <I>criterions</I> is sometimes employed.
<P>
The plural forms, <I>data, strata,</I> and <I>phenomena,</I> are so much
more frequently used than their singular forms, <I>datum, stratum,</I> and
<I>phenomenon,</I> that some writers have slipped into the habit of using
the plurals with a singular meaning; as, "The <I>aurora borealis</I> is a
very strange <I>phenomena."</I> "Our <I>data</I> is insufficient to establish
a theory." "The <I>strata</I> is broken and irregular."

  <B>Mussulmans</B>

While most words ending in <I>man</I> become plural by changing this termination
to <I>men,</I> as <I>gentlemen, noblemen, clergymen, statesmen, </I>the following
simply add <I>s</I>: <I>dragomans, Mussulmans, Ottomnans, talismans</I> "A
dozen dragomans offered their services as guides and interpreters." "A band
of Mussulmans cut off our retreat." "Those fierce Ottomans proved to be very
revengeful." "He purchased five finely upholstered ottomans for his
drawing-room."

  <B>Heroes, Cantos</B>

<P>
Most nouns ending in <I>o</I> add <I>es</I> to form the plural; as, <I>heroes,
negroes, potatoes, stuccoes, manifestoes, mosquitoes.</I> Words ending in
<I>io</I> or <I>yo</I> add <I>s;</I> as, <I>folios, nuncios, olios, ratios,
embryos</I>.
<P>
The following words, being less frequently used, often puzzle us to know
whether to add <I>s</I> or <I>es</I> to form the plural: <I>armadillos, cantos,
cuckoos, halos, juntos, octavos, provisos, salvos, solos, twos, tyros,
virtuosos.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Alms, Odds, Riches</B>

<P>
Many nouns that end in <I>s</I> have a plural appearance, and we are often
perplexed to know whether to use <I>this</I> or <I>these,</I> and whether
to employ a singular or a plural verb when the noun is used as a substantive.
<P>
<I>Amends</I> is singular. <I>Assets, dregs, eaves, bees, pincers, riches,
scissors, sheers, tongs, vitals,</I> are plural. When we
<P>
  <HR>
146
<P align=justify class=full>
say <I>a</I> <I>pair of pincers,</I> or <I>scissors</I>, or <I>shears,</I>
or <I>tongs,</I> the verb should be singular. <I>Tidings,</I> in Shakespeare's
time, was used indiscriminately with a singular or plural verb, but is now
generally regarded as plural.
<P>
<I>Alms</I> and <I>headquarters</I> are usually made plural, but are occasionally
found with a singular verb. <I>Pains</I> is usually singular. <I>Means,
odds,</I> and <I>species</I> are singular or plural, according to the meaning.
<P>
"By <I>this means</I> he accomplished his purpose." "What other <I>means
is </I>left to us?" "Your <I>means are</I> very slender, and your waste is

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Proper Names</B>

<P>
These are usually pluralized by adding <I>s</I>; as, <I>the Stuarts, the
Caesars, the Beechers, the Brownings.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Titles with Proper Names</B>

<P>
Shall we say <I>the Miss Browns, the Misses Brown,</I> or <I>the Misses
Browns?</I> Great diversity of opinion prevails. Gould Brown says: "The name
and not the title is varied to form the plural; as, <I>the Miss Howards,
the two Mr. Clarks."</I>
<P>
Alexander Bain, LL. D., says: "We may say <I>the Misses Brown,</I> or <I>the
Miss Browns,</I> or even <I>the Misses Browns."</I>
<P>
The chief objection to the last two forms is found when the proper name ends
with <I>s</I>, as when we say, <I>the Miss Brookses, the Miss Joneses, the
Miss Pottses, the</I>
<P>
  <HR>
147
<P align=justify class=full>
<I>Miss Blisses.</I> The form <I>the Misses Brooks</I> is objected to by

  <B>Plural Compounds</B>

The plural sign of a compound word is affixed to the principal part of the
word, to the part that conveys the predominant idea; as, <I>fathers-in-law,
man-servants, outpourings, ingatherings.</I> In such words as <I>handfuls,
cupfuls, mouthfuls,</I> the plural ending is added to the subordinate part
because the ideas are so closely associated as to blend into one.

  <B>Beaus, Beaux</B>

others take only the foreign plural; as, <I>bateaux, chateaux, tableaux.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Pair, Couple, Brace</B>

<P>
After numerals, the singular form of such words as these is generally employed;
as, five <I>pair</I> of gloves, eight <I>couple</I> of dancers, three
<I>brace</I> of pigeons, five

feed out of my hand." "Six barrels of <I>fish</I> were landed from the schooner."
<P>
Most words ending in <I>y</I> change this termination into <I>ies,</I> as
<I>duties, cities,</I> etc. The plural of <I>fly,</I> the insect, is formed

<h3>  CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h4>  <B>Adverbs</B></h4>

<P>
The clearness of the sentence is often dependent upon the proper placing
of the adverb. No absolute rule can be laid down, but it should generally
be placed before the word it qualifies. It is sometimes necessary to place
it after the verb, and occasionally between the auxiliary and the verb, but
it should never come between <I>to</I> and the <I>infinitive.</I>
<P>
"I have thought of marrying <I>often."</I> As the adverb relates to the thinking,
and not to the marrying, the sentence should read, "I have <I>often </I>thought
of marrying."
<P>
"We have <I>often</I> occasion to speak of health." This should be, "We
<I>often</I> have occasion," etc,
<P>
"It remains then <I>undecided</I> whether we shall go to Newport or Saratoga."
Place <I>undecided</I> before <I>then.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Adjective or Adverb?</B>

<P>
There is often a doubt in the mind of the speaker whether to use the adjective
or the adverb, and too frequently he reaches a wrong decision. When the limiting
word expresses a quality or state of the subject
<P>
  <HR>
151
<P align=justify class=full>
or of the object of a verb, the adjective must be employed; but if the manner
of the action is to be expressed, the adverb must be used. The verbs <I>be,
seem, look, taste, smell,</I> and <I>feel</I> furnish many stumbling-blocks.
<P>
"This rose smells <I>sweetly."</I> As the property or quality of the rose
is here referred to, and not the manner of smelling, the adjective <I>sweet
</I>should be employed, and not the adverb <I>sweetly.</I>
<P>
"Thomas feels quite <I>badly</I> about it." Here, again, it is the condition
of Thomas's mind, and not the manner of feeling, that is to be expressed;
hence, <I>badly</I> should be <I>bad</I> or <I>uncomfortable.</I>
<P>
"Didn't she look <I>beautifully</I> upon the occasion of her wedding?" No;
she looked <I>beautiful.</I>
<P>
"The sun shines brightly." <I>Bright</I> is the better word.
<P>
"The child looks <I>cold,"</I> refers to the condition of the child. "The
lady looked <I>coldly</I> upon her suitor," refers to the manner of looking.
<P>
"The boy feels warm" is correct. "The boy feels <I>warmly</I> the rebuke
of his teacher" is equally correct.
<P>
While license is granted to the poets to use the adjective for the adverb,
as in the line
<p class=center align=center>
  "They fall <I>successive</I> and <I>successive</I> rise,"
<P align=justify class=full>
in prose the one must never be substituted for the other.

<P>
<I>"Agreeably</I> to my promise, I now write," not <I>"Agreeable</I> to my

<P>
"Helen has been <I>awful</I> sick, but she is now <I>considerable </I>better."
"Helen has been very ill, but she is now <I>considerably </I>better."
<P>
Do not use <I>coarser</I> for more coarsely, <I>finer</I> for more finely,
<I>harsher</I> for more harshly, <I>conformable</I> for conformably, <I>decided
</I>for decidedly, <I>distinct</I> for distinctly, <I>fearful</I> for fearfully,
<I>fluent</I> for fluently.
<P>
Do not say "This melon is <I>uncommon</I> good," but "This melon is
<I>uncommonly</I> good."
<P>
The word <I>ill</I> is both an adjective and an adverb. Do not say "He can
illy afford to live in such a house," but "He can <I>ill</I> afford."
<P>
"That was a <I>dreadful</I> solemn sermon." To say "That was a <I>dreadfully
</I>solemn sermon" would more grammatically express what the speaker intended,
but <I>very</I> or <I>exceedingly</I> would better express the meaning.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Such, So</B>

<P>
<I>Such</I> is often improperly used for the adverb <I>so.</I>
<P>
"In <I>such</I> a mild and healthful climate." This should be, "In <I>so</I>
mild and healthful a climate."
<P>
  <HR>

<P>
"With all due deference to <I>such</I> a high authority on <I>such</I> a

an authority on <I>so</I> very important a matter."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Good, Well</B>

<P>
Many intelligent persons carelessly use the adjective <I>good</I> in the
sense of the adverb <I>well;</I> as, "I feel <I>good</I> to-day." "Did you
sleep <I>good</I> last night?" "Does this coat look <I>good</I> enough to
wear on the street?" "I can do it as <I>good</I> as he can." The frequent
indulgence in such errors dulls the sense of taste and weakens the power
of discrimination.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Very much of</B>

<P>
"She is <I>very much of</I> a lady." Say, "She is very ladylike." "He is
<I>very much of</I> a gentleman." Say, "He is very gentlemanly."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Quite</B>

<P>
This adverb is often incorrectly used in the sense of <I>very</I> or
<I>rather.</I> It should be employed only in the sense of <I>wholly</I> or
<I>entirely.</I> These sentences are therefore incorrect:
<P>
"He was wounded <I>quite</I> severely."
<P>
"James was <I>quite</I> tired of doing nothing."
<P>
  <HR>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>How</B>

<P>
This word is sometimes used when another would be more appropriate.
<P>
"He said <I>how</I> he would quit farming." Use <I>that.</I>
<P>
"Ye see <I>how</I> that not many wise men are called." We must read the Bible
as we find it, but in modern English the sentence would be corrected by omitting
<I>how.</I>
<P>
"Be careful <I>how</I> you offend him." If the manner of offending is the
thought to be expressed, the sentence is correct. But the true meaning is
doubtless better expressed by, "Be careful <I>lest</I> you offend him."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>No, Not</B>

<P>
"I cannot tell whether he will come or <I>no."</I> "Whether he be a sinner

of <I>no.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>This much</B>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>That far</B>

<P>
The expressions <I>this far</I> and <I>that far,</I> although they are very

  <B>Over, More than</B>

<P>
"There were not <I>over</I> thirty persons present." <I>Over</I> is incorrect;
<I>above</I> has some sanction; but <I>more than,</I> is the best, and should
be used.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Real good</B>

<P>
This is one of those good-natured expressions that insinuate themselves into
the speech of even cultured people. <I>Very good</I> is just as short, and
much more correct. <I>Really good</I> scarcely conveys the thought intended.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>So nice</B>

<P>
"This basket of flowers is <I>so</I> <I>nice." So nice</I> does not tell
<I>how</I> <I>nice. So</I> requires a correlative to complete its meaning.
Use <I>very nice</I> or <I>very pretty.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Pell-mell</B>

<P>
"He rushes <I>pell-mell</I> down the street." One bird cannot flock by itself,

<h3>  CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>  <B>Conjunctions</B></h4>

<P>
As a general rule, sentences should not begin with conjunctions. <I>And,
or,</I> and <I>nor</I> are often needlessly employed to introduce a sentence.
The disjunctive <I>but</I> may sometimes be used to advantage in this position,
and in animated and easy speech or writing the coordinate conjunction
<I>and</I> may be serviceable, but these and all other conjunctions, when
made to introduce sentences, should be used sparingly.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Reason, Because</B>

<P>
"The <I>reason</I> I ask you to tell the story is <I>because</I> you can
do it better than I." <I>Because</I> means <I>"for the reason</I>." This
makes the sentence equivalent to "The <I>reason</I> I ask you to tell the
story is <I>for the reason</I> that you can do it better than I." Use <I>that
</I>instead of because.
<P>
<I>"Because</I> William studied law is no <I>reason</I> why his brother should
not do so." The following is better: <I>"That</I> William studied law is
no <I>reason</I> why his brother should not do so."

<P>
The second <I>that</I> is superfluous. This fault is very
<P>
  <HR>
158
<P align=justify class=full>
common with writers who use long sentences. The intervention of details between
the first <I>that</I> and the clause which it is intended to introduce causes

"The Romans loved war better <I>than</I> the Greeks." Such ambiguous forms

  <B>But that</B>

"He suffered no inconvenience <I>but that</I> arising from the dust." <I>But

"Passengers are requested not to converse with <I>either</I> conductor or

<h3>  CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4>  <B>Correlatives</B></h4>

<P>
Certain adverbs and conjunctions, in comparison or antithesis, require the
use of corresponding adverbs and conjunctions. Such corresponding words are
called correlatives. The following are the principal ones in use:
<PRE>  as, as.              not merely, but also.
  as, so.              not merely, but even.
  both, and.           so, as.
  if, then.            so, that.
  either, or.          such, as.
  neither, nor.        such, that.
  not only, but.       though, yet.
  not only, but also.  when, then.
  not only, but even.  where, there.
  not merely, but.     whether, or.
</PRE>
<P>
The improper grouping of these correlatives is the cause of many errors in
speech and writing.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>As... as</B>

<P>
"She is <I>as</I> wise <I>as</I> she is good." "Mary is <I>as</I> clever
<I>as </I>her brother." The correlatives <I>as... as</I> are
<P>
  <HR>
163
<P align=justify class=full>
employed in expressing equality. Their use in any other connection is considered
inelegant. <I>"As</I> far <I>as</I> I am able to judge, he would make a very
worthy officer." This is a very common error. The sentence should be,
<I>"So</I> far <I>as</I> I am able," etc.
<P>
<I>As</I> is often followed by <I>so. "As</I> thy days, <I>so</I> shall thy
strength be."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>So... as</B>

<P>
In such negative assertions as, "This is not <I>as</I> fine a tree <I>as</I>
that," the first <I>as</I> should be changed to <I>so</I>. Say, "She is not
<I>so</I> handsome <I>as</I> she once was." "This edition of Tennyson is
not <I>so</I> fine <I>as</I> that."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Either, Neither</B>

<P>
The correlatives <I>either, or,</I> and <I>neither, nor,</I> are employed
when two objects are mentioned; as, <I>"Either</I> you <I>or</I> I must go
to town to-day," "<I>Neither</I> James <I>nor</I> Henry was proficient in
history."
<P>
"He <I>neither</I> bought, sold, <I>or</I> exchanged stocks and bonds." The
sentence should be, "He <I>neither</I> bought, sold, <I>nor</I> exchanged
stocks and bonds."
<P>
"That is not true, <I>neither."</I> As we already have one negative in the
word <I>not,</I> the word <I>neither</I> should be changed <I>to either,</I>
to avoid the double negation.
<P>
A negative other than <I>neither</I> may take either <I>or</I> or <I>nor
</I>as its correlative, "She was <I>not</I> so handsome as her mother, <I>or
</I>so brilliant as her father." "He was <I>never</I> happy <I>nor
</I>contented afterward."
<P>
  <HR>
164
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Position of correlatives</B>

<P>
The placing of correlatives requires care. "He <I>not only</I> gave me advice,
<I>but also</I> money." This is a faulty construction because the first member
of the correlative, <I>not only,</I> being placed before the verb <I>gave</I>
leads us to expect that the action of <I>giving</I> is to be contrasted with
some other action. The close of the sentence reveals the fact that the words
<I>advice</I> and <I>money</I> represent the ideas intended for contrast.
The first correlative should, therefore, have been placed before
<I>advice,</I> and the sentence should read, "He gave me <I>not only</I>
advice, <I>but also </I>money."
<P>
"I remember that I am not here as a censor <I>either</I> of manners <I>or
</I>morals." This sentence from Richard Grant White will be improved by changing
the position of the first member of the correlative. "I remember that I am
not here as a censor of <I>either</I> manners <I>or</I> morals."
<P>
"I <I>neither</I> estimated myself highly <I>nor</I> lowly." It should be,
"I estimated myself <I>neither</I> highly <I>nor</I> lowly."
<P>
"He <I>neither</I> attempted to excite anger, <I>nor</I> ridicule, <I>nor
</I>admiration." The sentence should be, "He attempted to excite <I>neither
</I>anger, <I>nor</I> ridicule, <I>nor</I> admiration." But here we have
the correlative <I>neither, nor,</I> used with more than two objects, which
is a violation of a principle previously stated. The
<P>
  <HR>
165
<P align=justify class=full>
sentence is purposely introduced to call attention to the fact that many
respectable writers not only use <I>neither, nor,</I> with three or more
objects, but also defend it. This usage may be avoided by a reconstruction
of the sentence; as, "He did not attempt to excite anger, nor ridicule, nor
admiration."
<P>
  <HR>
166
<h3>  CHAPTER X</h3>
<h4>  <B>The Infinitive</B></h4>
<P>
Many errors arise from not knowing how to use the infinitive mood. Perhaps
the most common fault is to interpose an adverb between the preposition
<I>to</I> and the infinitive verb; as, "It is not necessary <I>to accurately
relate</I> all that he said." "You must not expect <I>to always find</I>
people agreeable." Whether we shall place the adverb before the verb or after
it must often be determined by considerations of emphasis and smoothness
as well as of clearness and correctness. In the foregoing sentences it is
better to place <I>accurately</I> after the verb, and <I>always</I> before
the preposition <I>to.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Supply "to"</B>

<P>
The preposition <I>to</I> as the sign of the infinitive is often improperly
omitted.
<P>
"Please <I>write</I> clearly, so that we may understand," "Your efforts will
tend to hinder rather than <I>hasten</I> the work," "Strive so to criticise
as not to embarrass
<P>
  <HR>
167
<P align=justify class=full>
nor <I>discourage</I> your pupil." These sentences will be corrected by inserting
<I>to</I> before the italicized words.
<P>
In such expressions as "Please <I>excuse</I> my son's absence," "Please
<I>write</I> me a letter," "Please <I>hand</I> me the book," many authorities
insist upon the use of <I>to</I> before the verb. The sentences may, however,
be regarded as softened forms of the imperative; as, <I>"Hand</I> me the
book, if you please." Transposed, "If you please, hand me the book." Contracted,
"Please, hand me the book." From this, the comma may have slipped out and
left the sentence as first written.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Omit "to"</B>

<P>
When a series of infinitives relate to the same object, the word <I>to</I>
should be used before the first verb and omitted before the others; as, "He
taught me <I>to read, write,</I> and <I>cipher."</I> "The most accomplished
way of using books at present is to serve them as some do lords&#8212; <I>learn</I>
their titles and then <I>brag</I> of their acquaintance."
<P>
The active verbs <I>bid, dare, feel, hear, let, make, need, see,</I> and
their participles, usually take the infinitive after them, without the
preposition <I>to.</I> Such expressions, as "He bade me <I>to depart," "</I>I
dare <I>to say</I> he is a villain," "I had difficulty in making him <I>to
see</I> his error," are, therefore, wrong, and are corrected by omitting
<I>to.</I>
<P>
  <HR>
168
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Incomplete Infinitive</B>

<P>
Such incomplete expressions as the following are very common: "He has not
gone to Europe, nor is he likely <I>to." "</I>She has not written her essay,
nor does she intend <I>to." "</I>Can a man arrive at excellence who has no
desire <I>to?"</I> The addition of the word <I>go</I> to the first sentence,
and of <I>write it,</I> to the second would make them complete. In the case
of the third sentence it would be awkward to say, "Can a man arrive at excellence
who has no desire <I>to arrive at excellence."</I> We therefore substitute
the more convenient expression "<I>to do so."</I>
<P>
  <HR>
169
<h3>  CHAPTER XI</h3>
<h4> <B>Participles</B></h4>

<P>
Participles relate to nouns or pronouns, or else are governed by prepositions.
Those ending in <I>ing</I> should not be made the subjects or objects of
verbs while they retain the government and adjuncts of participles. They
may often be converted into nouns or take the form of the infinitive.
<P>
"Not <I>attending</I> to this rule is the cause of a very common error."
Better, <I>"Inattention</I> to this rule," etc. "He abhorred <I>being</I>
in debt." Better, "He abhorred <I>debt," "Cavilling</I> and <I>objecting</I>
upon any subject is much easier than <I>clearing</I> up difficulties." Say,
"<I>To cavil</I> and <I>object</I> upon any subject is much easier than <I>to
clear </I>up difficulties."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Omit "of"</B>

<P>
Active participles have the same government as the verbs from which they
are derived. The preposition <I>of,</I> therefore, should not be used after
the participle, when the verb would not require it. Omit <I>of</I> in such
expressions as these: "Keeping <I>of</I> one day
<P>
  <HR>
170
<P align=justify class=full>
in seven," "By preaching <I>of</I> repentance," "They left beating <I>of
</I>Paul," "From calling <I>of</I> names they came to blows," "They set about
repairing <I>of</I> the walls."
<P>
If the article <I>the</I> occurs before the participle, the preposition <I>of
</I>must be retained; as, "They strictly observed <I>the keeping of</I> one
day in seven."
<P>
When a transitive participle is converted into a noun, <I>of</I> must be
inserted to govern the object following. "He was very exact in <I>forming
</I>his sentences," "He was very exact in <I>the formation of</I> his sentences."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Omit the possessive</B>

<P>
The possessive case should not be prefixed to a participle that is not taken
in all respects as a noun. It should, therefore, be expunged in the following
sentences: "By <I>our</I> offending others, we expose ourselves." "She rewarded
the boy for <I>his</I> studying so diligently." "He errs in <I>his</I> giving
the word a double construction."
<P>
The possessives in such cases as the following should be avoided: "I have
some recollection of his <I>father's</I> being a judge." "To prevent <I>its
</I>being a dry detail of terms." These sentences may be improved by recasting
them. "I have some recollection that his father was a judge." "To prevent
it from being a dry detail of terms."
<P>
  <HR>
171
<P>
When the noun or pronoun to which the participle relates is a passive subject,
it should not have the possessive form; as, "The daily instances of <I>men's
</I>dying around us remind us of the brevity of human life." "We do not speak
of a <I>monosyllable's</I> having a primary accent." Change <I>men's</I>
to <I>men,</I> and <I>monosyllable's</I> to <I>monosyllable.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>After verbs</B>

<P>
Verbs do not govern participles. "I intend <I>doing</I> it," "I remember
<I>meeting</I> Longfellow," and similar expressions should be changed by
the substitution of the infinitive for the participle; as, "I intend <I>to
do it," </I>"I remember <I>to have met</I> Longfellow."
<P>
After verbs signifying <I>to persevere, to desist,</I> the participle ending
in <I>ing</I> is permitted; as, "So when they <I>continued asking</I> him,
he lifted up himself, and said unto them."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Place</B>

<P>
In the use of participles and of verbal nouns, the leading word in sense
should always be made the leading word, and not the adjunct, in the construction.
<P>
"They did not give notice of the <I>pupil</I> leaving." Here, the leading
idea is <I>leaving. Pupil</I> should, therefore, be subordinate by changing
its form to the possessive; as, "They did not give notice of the <I>pupil's
</I>leaving." Better still, "They did not give notice that the pupil had
left."
<P>
  <HR>
172
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Clearness</B>

<P>
The word to which the participle relates should stand out clearly. "By giving
way to sin, trouble is encountered." This implies that trouble gives way
to sin. The relation of the participle is made clear by saying, "By giving
way to sin, we encounter trouble."
<P>
"By yielding to temptation, our peace is sacrificed." This should be, "By
yielding to temptation we sacrifice our peace."
<P>
"A poor child was found in the streets by a wealthy and benevolent gentleman,
suffering from cold and hunger." Say, "A poor child, suffering from cold
and hunger, was found," etc.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Awkward Construction</B>

<P>
Such awkward sentences as the following should be avoided. In most cases
they will require to be recast.
<P>
"But as soon as the whole body <I>is attempted to be carved,</I> a disproportion
between its various parts results."
<P>
"The offence <I>attempted to be charged</I> should be alleged under another
section of the statute." The following is a better arrangement:
<P>
"But as soon as an attempt is made to carve the whole body," etc. "The offence
which it is attempted to charge," etc.
<P>
  <HR>
173
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Is building</B>

<P>
The active participle in a passive sense is employed by many excellent writers
and is condemned by others.
<P>
"Corn <I>is selling</I> for fifty cents a bushel."
<P>
"Corn <I>is</I> <I>being sold</I> for fifty cents a bushel."
<P>
The commercial world evidently prefers the former sentence. There is a breeziness
and an energy in it that is lacking in the latter. It must, however, be used
with caution. In the following examples the passive form is decidedly better
than the active: "The foundation <I>was</I> <I>being laid,"</I> "They <I>are
being educated," "</I>While the speech <I>was being delivered," </I>etc.

<h3>  CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4>  <B>Prepositions</B></h4>

<P>
Clearness and elegance of style are, in no small degree, dependent upon the
choice and right use of prepositions. Many rules have been formulated, some
of which are deserving of consideration, while others are nearly or quite
useless. Among the latter may be mentioned, by way of illustration, the
oft-repeated rule that <I>between</I> or <I>betwixt</I> must invariably be
used when only two things are referred to, and that <I>among</I> must be
employed when more than two are named. While it is true that the order could
not be reversed, that <I>among,</I> when used, must be employed in reference
to three or more persons or things, and that <I>between</I> may always be
employed in speaking of two objects, yet the practice of many of the best
writers does not limit the use of <I>between</I> to two objects. In fact,
there are cases in which <I>among</I> will not take the place of
<I>between;</I> as, "I set out eighty trees with ample space <I>between</I>
them." "The stones on his farm were so plentiful that the grass could not
grow up <I>between</I> them."
<P>
  <HR>
175
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Between, Among</B>

<P>
"The seven children divided the apples <I>between</I> them." Two children
may divide apples <I>between,</I> them, but in this case it is better to
say, "The seven children divided the apples <I>among</I> them."
<P>
George Eliot, in <I>Middlemarch,</I> says: "The fight lay entirely <I>between
</I>Pinkerton, the old Tory member; Bagster, the new Whig member; and Brook,
the Independent member." In this case, <I>between</I> or <I>with</I> is more
satisfactory than <I>among,</I> although three persons are referred to.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Choice</B>

<P>
Many sentences betoken ignorance and others indicate extreme carelessness
on the part of the writers by the inapt choice of their prepositions, which
often express relations so delicate in their distinctions that nothing short
of an extended study of the best writers will confer the desired skill. We
present some examples.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By, In</B>

<P>
"We do not accept the proposition referred to <I>by</I> your letter." The
writer should have employed the preposition <I>in.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Differ with, From</B>

<P>
We differ <I>with</I> a person in opinion or belief; we differ <I>from</I>
him in appearance, in attainments, in wealth, in rank, etc.
<P>
  <HR>
176
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Different from, To, Than</B>

<P>
"Your story is very plausible, but Henry's is different <I>to </I>that."
"My book is quite different <I>than</I> his." The adjective <I>different</I>
must not be followed by the preposition <I>to</I> or <I>than. </I>The sentences
will be correct when <I>from</I> is substituted.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>At, To</B>

<P>
Never use the vulgar expression, "He is <I>to</I> home." Say <I>at home.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Preferred before, To</B>

<P>
"He was <I>preferred before</I> me." Say <I>preferred to me.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>With, Of</B>

<P>
"He died <I>with</I> consumption." <I>Of</I> is the proper preposition to
employ. But we say, He is afflicted <I>with</I> rheumatism, or bronchitis,
or other disease.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>In respect of, To</B>

<P>
"In respect <I>of</I> this matter, he is at fault." Better, <I>"to</I> this
matter."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Of, From</B>

<P>
"He was acquitted <I>from</I> the charge of larceny." Acquitted <I>of </I>the
charge.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>In, Into</B>

<P>
<I>Into</I> implies direction or motion. "They walked <I>into</I> the church,"
means that they entered it from the outside. "They walked <I>in</I> the church,"
means that they walked back and forth within the church.
<P>
  <HR>
177
<P>
"The vessel is <I>in</I> port." "She came <I>into</I> port yesterday."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Of, In</B>

<P>
"There was no use <I>of</I> asking his permission, for he would not grant
it." <I>In</I> asking.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>In, On</B>

<P>
"He is a person <I>in</I> whom you can rely." "That is a man <I>in</I> whose
statements you can depend." Use <I>on</I> for <I>in.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>To, With</B>

<P>
Two persons are reconciled <I>to</I> each other; two doctrines or measures
are reconciled <I>with</I> each other when they are made to agree.
<P>
"This noun is in apposition <I>to</I> that." Use <I>with.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>With, By</B>

<P>
These two prepositions are often confounded. They have a similarity of
signification with a difference of use. Both imply a connection between some
instrument or means and the agent by whom it is used. <I>With</I> signifies
the closer relation and <I>by</I> the more remote one.
<P>
It is said that an ancient king of Scotland once asked his nobles by what
tenure they held their lands. The chiefs drew their swords, saying, <I>"By
</I>these we acquired our lands, and <I>with</I> these we will defend them."
<P>
<I>By</I> often relates to the person; <I>with</I> to the instrument.
<P>
  <HR>
178
<P>
"He lay on the ground half concealed <I>with</I> a clump of bushes." "That
speech was characterized <I>with</I> eloquence." Use <I>by</I> in the last
two sentences.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>With, To</B>

<P>
We <I>correspond with</I> a person when we exchange letters. In speaking
of the adaptation of one object to another, the preposition <I>to </I>should
be used after the verb correspond; as, "This picture corresponds <I>to</I>
that." <I>With</I> is often incorrectly used in such cases instead of
<I>to.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Position</B>

<P>
The old grammarian gave a very good rule when he said, "A preposition is
a very bad word to end a sentence with;" but it is sometimes easier to follow
his example than his precept. In general, the strength of a sentence is improved
by not placing small particles at the end.
<P>
"Which house do you live <I>in?"</I> Better, "In which house do you live?"
<P>
"Avarice is a vice which most men are guilty <I>of."</I> Say, "of which most
men are guilty."
<P>
"He is a man that you should be acquainted <I>with."</I> Say, <I>"with </I>whom
you should be acquainted."
<P>
"Is this the man that you spoke <I>of?"</I> Better, <I>"of</I> whom you spoke."
<P>
"These are principles that our forefathers died <I>for."</I> Rather, <I>"for
</I>which our forefathers died."
<P>
  <HR>
179
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Omission</B>

<P>
Prepositions are often omitted when their use is necessary to the correct
grammatical construction of the sentence.
<P>
"They now live on this side the river." Say, "on this side <I>of</I> the
river."
<P>
"Esther and Helen sit opposite each other." It is more correct to say, "sit
opposite <I>to</I> each other."
<P>
"John is worthy our help." Better, "<I>of</I> our help."
<P>
"What use is this to us?" <I>Of</I> what use, etc.
<P>
"This law was passed the same year that I was born." Say, "In the same year,"
etc.
<P>
"Washington was inaugurated President April 30, 1789." Some critics insist
upon the insertion of <I>on</I> before a date, as <I>"on</I> April 30," but
general usage justifies its omission. With equal force they might urge the
use of <I>in</I> before 1789. The entire expression of day, month, and year
is elliptical.
<P>
If the same preposition be required by several nouns or pronouns, it must
be repeated in every case if it be repeated at all. "He is interested <I>in
</I>philosophy, history, and <I>in</I> science." This sentence may be corrected
by placing <I>in</I> before history or by omitting it before science. The
several subjects are individualized more strongly by the use of <I>in
</I>before each noun. This is shown in the greater obscurity given to
<I>history</I> by the omission of the preposition in the foregoing sentence.
<P>
  <HR>
180
<P>
"We may have a feeling of innocence or of guilt, of merit or demerit." Insert
<I>of</I> before demerit.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Needless Prepositions</B>

<P>
Prepositions, like other parts of speech that contribute nothing to the meaning,
should not be suffered to cumber the sentence.
<P>
Where am I <I>at?</I> Where is my book <I>at?</I> I went there <I>at</I>
about noon. In what latitude is Chicago <I>in?</I> Where are you going <I>to?
</I>Take your hat off <I>of</I> the table. Where has James been <I>to?</I>
They offered <I>to</I> Caesar a crown. This is a subject <I>of</I> which
I intended to speak <I>about</I> (omit <I>of</I> or <I>about,</I> but not
both). She has a sister <I>of</I> ten years old. Leap <I>in</I> with me into
this angry flood.
<P>
The older writers employed the useless <I>for</I> in such expressions as,
What went ye out <I>for</I> to see? The apostles and elders came together
<I>for </I>to consider <I>of</I> this matter.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>All of</B>

<P>
A very common error is the unnecessary use of the preposition <I>of</I> after
<I>all;</I> as, "during <I>all of</I> this period," "in <I>all of</I> these
cases," "for <I>all of</I> the conditions," etc.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Up above</B>

<P>
In most cases one of these prepositions will be found useless. "The ladder
reached <I>up above</I> the chimney."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>From hence</B>

<P>
The adverbs <I>hence, thence, whence,</I> include the idea of <I>from.</I>
The preposition should, therefore, be omitted.

<h4>  <B>The Article</B></h4>

<P>
<I>A,</I> which is a shortened form of <I>an,</I> signifies <I>one, </I>or
<I>any. An</I> was formerly used before nouns beginning with either a consonant
or a vowel sound, but now <I>an</I> is used before a vowel sound and <I>a</I>
before a consonant sound; as, <I>a</I> book, <I>a</I> hat, <I>an </I>apple,
<I>an</I> eagle.
<P>
It will be observed that <I>an</I> heiress, <I>an</I> herb, <I>an</I> honest
man, <I>an</I> honorable career, <I>an</I> hourly visit, <I>a</I> euchre
party, <I>a</I> euphemism, <I>a</I> eulogy, <I>a</I> union, etc., are not
exceptions to the foregoing rule, for the <I>h</I> being silent in <I>heiress,
herb, </I>etc., the article <I>an</I> precedes a vowel sound, and in
<I>euphemism, eulogy, union,</I> the article <I>a</I> precedes the consonant
sound of <I>y. </I>Compare <I>u-nit</I> with <I>you knit.</I>
<P>
In like manner some persons have felt disposed to say <I>many an one
</I>instead of <I>many a one</I> because of the presence of the vowel
<I>o</I>. But the sound is the consonant sound of <I>w</I> as in <I>won</I>,
and the article should be <I>a</I> and not <I>an.</I>
<P>
There is a difference of opinion among writers concerning the use of <I>a</I>
and <I>an,</I> before words beginning
<P>
  <HR>
182
<P align=justify class=full>
with <I>h,</I> when not silent, especially when the accent falls on the second
syllable; as, <I>a</I> harpoon, <I>a</I> hegira, <I>a</I> herbarium, <I>a</I>
herculean effort, <I>a</I> hiatus, <I>a</I> hidalgo, <I>a</I> hydraulic engine,
<I>a</I> hyena, <I>a</I> historian. The absence of the accent weakens the
<I>h </I>sound, and makes it seem as if the article <I>a</I> was made to
precede a vowel. The use of <I>an</I> is certainly more euphonious and is
supported by <I>Webster's Dictionary</I> and other high authority.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>The Honorable, The Reverend</B>

Such titles as <I>Honorable</I> and <I>Reverend</I> require the article

We are all creatures of habit. Our sayings, as well as our doings, are largely
a series of habits. In some instances we are unconscious of our peculiarities
and find it almost impossible to shake them off.
<P>
The following are verbatim expressions as they dropped from the lips of a
young clergyman in the pulpit. They show a deeply-seated habit of repetition
of thought. As he was a graduate of one of the first colleges in the land,
we are the more surprised that the habit was not checked before he passed
through his college and seminary courses. The expressions are here given
as a caution to others to be on their guard: "Supremest and highest," "separate
and sever us," "derision, sarcasm, and contempt," "disobedient and disloyal
and sinful," "hold aloof from iniquity, from sin," "necessity of being reclaimed
and brought back," "their beautiful and their elegant city," "so abandoned
and given up to evil and iniquity," "soaked and stained with human gore and
blood," "beautiful and resplendent," "hardened and solidified into stone
and adamant," "this

the splendor of his genius," "the force and the pressure it brings to bear,"
"has and possesses the power," "lights flashed and gleamed."
<P>
The above were all taken from a single discourse. Another peculiarity of
the same speaker was his use of the preposition <I>between.</I> Instead of
saying, "Between him and his father there was a perfect understanding of
the matter," he would say, "Between him and <I>between</I> his father there
was a perfect understanding of the matter."
<P>
Young writers will find it a valuable exercise to go through a letter, essay,
or other composition which they have written, with the view of ascertaining
how many words they can eliminate without diminishing the force of what has
been written. An article or two from the daily paper, and an occasional page
from some recent work of fiction will afford further opportunity for profitable
practice in pruning.

  <B>Why</B>

<P>
Many persons have a foolish habit of beginning their answer to a question
with the word <I>why</I>. In some cases it doubtless has its origin in the
desire to gain time while the mind is preparing the answer, but in most instances
it is merely a habit.
<P>
Some persons prefix the word <I>why</I> to the statement of a fact or to
the asking of a question. This is even worse than to employ it to introduce
the answer. Restrict it to its legitimate use.

This is one of the numerous expressions designed to call the attention of

among school children, and should be promptly checked by the teacher. The
<I>off</I> is superfluous.
<P>
"He jumped <I>off</I> <I>of</I> the boat." Say, "He jumped <I>off</I> the
boat."

The young lady appointed to sell articles at a church fair entreated her

"But what went ye out <I>for</I> to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?"

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Appreciate highly</B>

To <I>appreciate</I> is to set a full value upon a thing. We may <I>value

"With great difficulty they <I>ascended up</I> the hill." As they could not

  <B>Both</B>

The sentence, "The two children <I>both</I> resembled each other," will be

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>But that</B>

"I do not doubt <I>but that</I> my uncle will come." The sentence is shorter

the crew was drowned." Here <I>but</I> is necessary. Without it the opposite
meaning would be conveyed.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Equally as well</B>

"James did it well, but Henry did it <I>equally as</I> <I>well." As well</I>

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Had ought to</B>

"I had ought to have gone to school to-day; I hadn't ought to have gone fishing."
Incorrect. Say, "I ought to have gone (or <I>I should have gone) </I>to school
to-day; I ought not to have gone fishing." If the second clause is not an
after-thought the sentence can be still further improved by condensing it;
as, "I should have gone to school to-day, and not to have gone fishing."

<h3>  CHAPTER XV</h3>
<h4>  <B>Two Negatives</B></h4>

<P>
The use of two negatives in a sentence is much more common than is generally
supposed. To assume that only those who are grossly ignorant of grammatical
rules and constructions employ them, is an error. Writers whose names are
as bright stars in the constellation of literature have slipped on this
treacherous ground.
<P>
A negation, in English, admits of only one negative word. The use of a single
negative carries the meaning halfway around the circle. The meaning is therefore
diametrically opposed to that which would be expressed without the negative.
The use of a second negative would carry the meaning the remaining distance
around the circle, thus bringing it to the starting point, and making it
equivalent to the affirmative. The second negative destroys the effect of
the first. The two negatives are equivalent to an affirmative.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Double Negatives</B>

<P>
While two negatives in the same sentence destroy each other, a double negative
has the effect of a more
<P>
  <HR>
195
<P align=justify class=full>
exact and guarded affirmative; as, "It is <I>not im</I>probable that Congress
will convene in special session before the end of the summer." "It is <I>not
un</I>important that, he attend to the matter at once." "His story was <I>not
in</I>credible." "The fund was <I>not in</I>exhaustible."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Redundant Negatives</B>

<P>
<I>"No</I> one <I>else</I> but the workmen had any business at the meeting."

"Let us see whether <I>or not</I> there was <I>not</I> a mistake in the record."
Omit either <I>or not</I> or the second <I>not.</I>
<P>
"The boat will <I>not</I> stop <I>only</I> when the signal flag is raised."
Omit <I>not</I> or change <I>only</I> to <I>except.</I>
<P>
"He will <I>never</I> return, I <I>don't believe."</I> Say, "He will never
return," or, if that statement is two emphatic, say, "I don't believe he
will ever return."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Don't want none</B>

<P>
"I <I>don't want none," "</I>I <I>ain't got nothing," "</I>He <I>can't do
no more,"</I> are inelegant expressions that convey a meaning opposed to
that intended.
<P>
"I don't want any," or, "I do not want any," or, "I want none," are correct
equivalents for the first sentence; "I haven't anything," or, "I have nothing,"
should take the place of the second; and, "He can't do any more," or, "He
can do no more," or "He cannot do more," will serve for the third.

"I <I>cannot</I> stop to tell you <I>hardly</I> any of the adventures that

"The faculties are called into <I>no</I> exercise by doing a thing merely

"There was <I>nothing</I> at the Columbian Exposition more beautiful,

<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Can't do nothing</B>

"He can't do anything for me."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Cannot by no means</B>

<P>
This double negative should be avoided. "I <I>cannot by no means </I>permit

consideration,</I> permit you to go."

<h3>  CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<h4>  <B>Accordance of Verb with Subject</B></h4>

<P>
No rule of grammar is more familiar to the schoolboy than that which relates
to the agreement of the verb with its subject, or nominative, and none that
is more frequently violated. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that
the schoolboy is the only transgressor. Ladies and gentlemen of culture and
refinement, writers and speakers of experience and renown, have alike been
caught in the quicksands of verb constructions.
<P>
"This painting is one of the finest masterpieces that ever <I>was</I> given
to the world." A transposition of the sentence will show that the verb should
be <I>were,</I> and not <I>was. "</I>Of the finest masterpieces that ever
<I>were </I>given to the world, this painting is one."
<P>
"His essay on 'Capital and Labor' is one of the best that <I>has</I> ever
been written on the subject." The verb should be <I>have.</I>
<P>
"The steamer, with all her passengers and crew, <I>were</I> lost." The subject
is <I>steamer,</I> and the verb should be <I>was.</I>
<P>
  <HR>
199
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Interrogative sentences</B>

<P>
"What <I>signifies</I> his good resolutions, when he does not possess strength
of purpose sufficient to put them into practice?" <I>Resolutions</I> is the
subject, and the verb should be <I>signify.</I>
<P>
"Of what profit is his prayers, while his practices are the abomination of
the neighborhood?" <I>Prayers</I> being plural, the verb should be
<I>are.</I>
<P>
"What <I>avails</I> good sentiments with a bad life?" Use <I>avail.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Subject after the Verb</B>

<P>
"In virtue and piety <I>consist</I> the happiness of man." <I>Happiness,
</I>the subject, being singular, the verb should be <I>consists,</I> to agree
with its nominative.
<P>
"To these recommendations <I>were</I> appended a copy of the minority report."
A transposition of the sentence will show that the verb should be <I>was</I>,
and not <I>were.</I> "A copy of the minority report <I>was</I> appended to
these recommendations."
<P>
Whenever the sentence is introduced by a phrase consisting in part of a noun
in the plural, or several nouns in the singular or plural, and, especially,
where the subject follows the verb; care must be taken to keep the nominative
well in mind, so that the verb may be in strict accord with it.
<P>
  <HR>
200
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Compound Subjects</B>

<P>
When a verb has two or more nominatives it must be plural. These nominatives
may or may not be connected by <I>and</I> or other connecting particle. The
nominatives may consist of nouns or pronouns, either singular or plural,
or they may be phrases.
<P>
"Washington and Lincoln <I>were</I> chosen instruments of government."
<P>
"Judges and senates <I>have</I> been bought for gold,
<P>
Esteem and love <I>were</I> never to be sold."&#8212; <I>Pope.</I>
<P>
"Art, empire, earth itself, to change <I>are </I>doomed."&#8212; <I>Beattie.</I>
<P>
"You and he <I>resemble</I> each other."
<P>
"To read and to sing <I>are</I> desirable accomplishments."
<P>
"To be wise in our own eyes, to be wise in the opinion of the world, and
to be wise in the sight of our Creator, <I>are</I> three things so very different
as rarely to coincide."&#8212; <I>Blair.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Singular in Meaning</B>

<P>
Nominatives are sometimes plural in form but singular in meaning. Such
nominatives require a verb in the singular.
<P>
"The philosopher and poet <I>was</I> banished from his country." <I>Was</I>
is correct, because philosopher and poet are the same person.
<P>
  <HR>
201
<P>
"Ambition, and not the safety of the state, <I>was</I> concerned." <I>Was</I>
is correct, because <I>ambition</I> is the subject. The words, <I>"and not
the safety of the state,"</I> simply emphasize the subject, but do not give
it a plural meaning.
<P>
"Truth, and truth only, <I>is</I> worth seeking for its own sake." Another
case of emphasis.
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Each, Every, No, Not</B>

<P>
When two or more nominatives are qualified by one of the foregoing words
the verb must be singular.
<P>
"Every limb and feature <I>appears</I> with its respective
grace."&#8212; <I>Steele.</I>
<P>
"Not a bird, not a beast, not a tree, not a shrub <I>were</I> to be seen."
Use <I>was</I> instead of <I>were.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Poetical Construction</B>

<P>
When the verb separates its nominatives, it agrees with that which precedes
it.
<P>
"Forth in the pleasing spring, Thy beauty <I>walks,</I> thy tenderness, and
love."&#8212; <I>Thomson.</I> <I></I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Or, Nor, As well as, But, Save</B>

<P>
When two or more nominatives in the singular are separated by such words
as the preceding, the verb must be singular.
<P>
"Veracity, as well as justice, <I>is</I> to be our rule of
life."&#8212; <I>Butler.</I>
<P>
  <HR>
202
<P>
"Not a weed nor a blade of grass <I>were</I> to be seen." Change <I>were
</I>to <I>was</I>.
<P>
"Nothing but wailings <I>were</I> heard." Transpose. "Nothing <I>was</I>
heard but wailings." The verb should be <I>was</I>.
<P>
"Either one or the other of them <I>are</I> in the wrong." The verb should
be <I>is.</I>
<P>
If, however, one or more of the nominatives are plural, the verb must be
plural.
<P>
"It is not his wealth, or gifts, or culture that <I>gives</I> him this
distinction." <I>Gifts</I> being plural, the verb should be <I>give.</I>
<P>
Some authorities say that the verb should agree in number with the subject
which is placed next before it, and be understood (or silent) to the rest;
as, "Neither he nor his brothers <I>were</I> there," "Neither his brothers
nor he was there," "Neither you nor I <I>am</I> concerned."
<P>
Prof. Genung, author of <I>Outlines of Rhetoric,</I> says: "When a clash
of concord arises, either choose subjects that have the same number, or choose
a verb that has the same form for both numbers." He gives this sentence to
show the change of verb: "Fame or the emoluments of valor <I>were</I>
(<I>was</I>) never to be his." "Fame or the emoluments of valor could never
be his." And this sentence to show the change of one of the subjects: "Neither
the halter nor bayonets
<P>
  <HR>
203
<P align=justify class=full>
<I>are</I> (<I>is</I>) sufficient to prevent us from obtaining our rights."
"Neither the halter nor the bayonet <I>is</I> sufficient to prevent us from
obtaining our rights."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Collective Nouns</B>

<P>
Collective nouns, like <I>army, committee, class, peasantry, nobility, </I>are,
grammatically, singular, but they are often so modified by their surroundings
as to convey a plural idea, and when so modified the verb must be plural.
When the collective noun conveys the idea of unity, the verb must be singular.
<P>
"The army <I>was</I> disbanded."
<P>
"The council <I>were</I> divided."
<P>
"A number of men and women <I>were</I> present."
<P>
"The people <I>rejoice</I> in their freedom."
<P>
"The peasantry <I>go</I> barefoot, and the middle sort <I>make</I> use of
wooden shoes."
<P>
"The world <I>stands</I> in awe of your majesty."
<P>
"All the world <I>are</I> spectators of your conduct."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Weights, Measures, and Values</B>

<P>
The names of weights, measures, and values, when considered as wholes, require
singular verbs, and when considered as units require verbs in the plural.
<P>
"There <I>is</I> twenty shillings in my purse," meaning one pound in value.
"There <I>are</I> twenty shillings in my purse," meaning twenty separate
coins, each being a shilling. "Sixty-three gallons <I>equals</I> a hogshead."
"Ten tons of coal <I>are</I> consumed daily."
<P>
  <HR>
204
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Titles of Books</B>

<P>
Whether the form be singular or plural, the title is considered a unit, and
requires a verb in the singular; as, "'The Merry Wives of Windsor' <I>was</I>
written by Shakespeare." "Dr. Holmes's <I>American Annals was</I> published
in 1805."
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Whereabouts</B>

<P>
"The whereabouts of his cousins <I>were</I> not known to him." The plural
form of this word is misleading. The verb should be <I>was.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>Phenomena, Effluvia</B>

<P>
"A strange phenomena," "A disagreeable effluvia" are incorrect forms not
infrequently met with. Both words are plural, and require plural verbs and
also the omission of the article <I>a.</I>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>You was</B>

<P>
This very incorrect form is often employed by those who know better, and
who use it, seemingly, out of courtesy to the uneducated people with whom
they are brought in contact. If it be a courtesy, it is one that is "more
honored in the breach than in the observance."
<P>
Those who use the expression ignorantly are not likely to read this book,
or any other of a similar character, and need scarcely be told that
<I>was</I> should be <I>were</I>.

SOME books are designed for entertainment, others for information. This series
combines both features. The information is not only complete and reliable,
it is compact and readable. In this busy, bustling age it is required that
the information which books contain shall be ready to hand and presented
in the clearest and briefest manner possible. These volumes are replete with
valuable information, compact in form and unequalled in point of merit and
cheapness. They are the latest as well as the best books on the subjects
of which they treat. No one wishing to have a fund of general information
or who has the desire for self-improvement can afford to be without them.

There is no passport to good society like good manners. Even though a person
possess wealth and intelligence, his success in life may be marred by ignorance
of social customs. A perusal of this book will prevent such blunders. It
is a book for everybody, for the select sets as well as for the less ambitious.
The subject is presented in a bright and interesting manner, and represents
the latest vogue.

<p class=center align=center>

<P>
Why do most persons dislike letter writing? Is it not because they cannot
say the right thing in the right place? This admirable book not only shows
by numerous examples just what kind of letters to write, but by directions
and suggestions enables the reader to become an accomplished original letter
writer. There are forms for all kinds of business and social letters, including
invitations, acceptances, letters of sympathy, congratulations, and love
letters.

<B>QUOTATIONS</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By Agnes H. Morton</B>

<P>
A clever compilation of pithy quotations, selected from a great variety of
sources, and alphabetically arranged according to the sentiment. In addition
to all the popular quotations in current use, it contains many rare bits
of prose and verse not generally found in similar collections. An important
feature of the book is the characteristic lines from well known authors,
in which the familiar sayings are credited to their original sources.

<B>THINGS WORTH KNOWING</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By John H. Bechtel</B>

<P>
It is a comparatively easy task to fill a book with a mass of uninteresting
statistical matter. It is quite another thing to get together a vast accumulation
of valuable material on all conceivable subjects. This book is thoroughly
up to date, and embraces many subjects not usually found in works of this
kind. It contains information for everybody, whether it pertains to health,
household, business, affairs of state, foreign countries, or the planets,
and all most conveniently indexed.

<B>A DICTIONARY OF MYTHOLOGY</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By John H. Bechtel</B>

<P>
The average person dislikes to look up a mythological subject because of
the time occupied. This book remedies that difficulty because in it can be
found at a glance just what is wanted. It is comprehensive, convenient,
condensed, and the information is presented in such an interesting manner
as when once read to be always remembered. A distinctive feature of the book
is the pronunciation of the proper names, something found in few other works.

<P>
Who does not make them? The best of us do. Why not avoid them? Any one inspired
with the spirit of self-improvement can readily do so. No necessity for studying
rules of grammar or rhetoric when this book can be had. It teaches both without
the study of either. It is a counsellor, a critic, a companion, and a guide,
and is written in a most entertaining and chatty style.

<B>HANDBOOK OF PRONUNCIATION</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By John H. Bechtel</B>

<P>
What is more disagreeable than a faulty pronunciation? No other defect so
clearly shows a lack of culture. This book contains over 5,000 words on which
most of us are apt to trip. They are here pronounced in the clearest and
simplest manner, and according to the best authority. It is more readily
consulted than a dictionary, and is just as reliable.

<B>PRACTICAL SYNONYMS</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By John H. Bechtel</B>

<P>
Any one with the least desire to add to his vocabulary or to improve his
choice of words should have a copy of this book. It is designed mainly to
meet the wants of busy merchants or lawyers, thoughtful clergymen or teachers,
and wide-awake school-boys or girls who are ambitious to express the thoughts
of the mind in more fitting phrases than they are at present capable of doing.

<B>TOASTS</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By William Pittenger</B>

<P>
Most men dread being called upon to respond to a toast or to make an address.
What would you not give for the ability to be rid of this embarrassment?
No need to give much when you can learn the art from this little book. It
will tell you how to do it; not only that, but by example it will show the
way. It is valuable not alone to the novice, but the experienced speaker
will gather from it many suggestions.

<B>THE DEBATER'S TREASURY</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By William Pittenger</B>

<P>
There is no greater ability than the power of skillful and forcible debate,
and no accomplishment more readily acquired if the person is properly directed.
In this little volume are directions for organizing and conducting debating
societies and practical suggestions for all who desire to discuss questions
in public. There is also a list of over 200 questions for debate, with arguments
both affirmative and negative.

<B>PUNCTUATION</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By Paul Allardyce</B>

<P>
Few persons can punctuate properly; to avoid mistakes, many do not punctuate
at all. A perusal of this book will remove all difficulties and make all
points clear. The rules are clearly stated and freely illustrated, thus
furnishing a most useful volume. The author is everywhere recognized as the
leading authority upon the subject, and what he has to say is practical,
concise, and comprehensive.

<B>ORATORY</B>
<p class=center align=center>
  <B>By Henry Ward Beecher</B>

<P>
It must be conceded that few men ever enjoyed a wider experience or achieved
a higher reputation in the realm of public oratory than Mr. Beecher. What
he had to say on this subject was born of experience, and his own inimitable
style was at once both statement and illustration of his theme. This volume
is a unique and masterly treatise on the fundamental principles of true oratory.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
