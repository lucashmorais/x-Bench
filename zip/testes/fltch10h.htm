<h1><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h1>

<h2>BY COMMISSIONER RAILTON.</h2>

<p>There is a great difference between
a red-hot man and a Red-hot Library book We
have no desire at all to pander to the common idea
of our day that &#8220;it does not matter what you
belong to,&#8221; by any of these books Very
little reflection will show anyone the immeasurable
distance between the sort of clergyman this book describes
and the mere leader of formalities holding a similar
position in these days of ease and self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>John Fletcher was a marvel, if viewed
only on his bodily side At a time when clergymen
had far more opportunity than they have even to-day
to retire into their own houses and do nothing for
the world, he pressed forward, in spite of an almost
dying body, to work for God daily, in the most devoted
manner That he was able to continue his labours
so long was simply by God&#8217;s wonder-working mercy.&#160;
We cannot judge him because he remained in the strange
position (for anyone who cares about God or souls)
in which he was found No other sphere was perhaps
possible for him at that time It must not, however,
for that reason be imagined that the Salvationist
can conceive of a red-hot life mixed with the reading
of prayers out of a book, or the teaching of any poor
soul to turn to such heathenish folly.</p>

<p>We can gladly take whatever is red-hot
out of such a life without allowing ourselves to be
poisoned in any respect whilst so doing But
it seems necessary, at the very outset, to call attention
to this, lest at any time it should be argued that,
after all, the Salvationist life is no better, in
our opinion, than the stiffest and most formal specimen
of Christianity.</p>

<p>About this fervent soul, whose wife
was one of the few preaching women of her century,
there could have been little voluntary formality, and
if he was able to exist amidst the framing that others
had set up for him, it may be an encouragement to
anyone who is shut out for a time from the free, happy
worship that God  desires, and left with no alternative
but to be content with &#8220;Divine services&#8221;
where God&#8217;s wishes are too often made of no
effect by the arrangement of man.</p>

<p>But what will be the Salvationist&#8217;s
condemnation if, with all the opportunities he has
to cultivate the utmost freedom in prayer and service,
he never attains to that intimacy with God, that delight
in communion with Him, that power to force others
into God&#8217;s presence, which John Fletcher&#8217;s
life discloses to us?</p>

<p>The mere thought of Fletcher, if you
read these pages carefully, will ever bring back to
you an impression of nearness to God and companionship
with Him which is scarcely conceived of in our day
amongst the majority of those who ought to lead men
to the Father Do not let us excuse ourselves
for any lack of that communion which must be His continual
delight If we prjde ourselves upon our repudiation
of forms of worship that men have invented, and glory
in the manifestations of Christ at the street corner
and in the public-house, to which we have become accustomed,
let us take care that we do not grieve Him by contentment
with the general action of The Army or of the Corps,
or of the Brigade, in the absence of any close contact
between our own souls and God or the lost.</p>

<p>This book will be useless unless it
brings us continually right up to the personal questions
which it is so eminently calculated to raise:&#160;
Am I on such terms with God as this man was?&#160; Can
He equally reckon upon my continual obedience and
faithfulness?&#160; Is He sure to hear and answer me
also?&#160; Do I share with Him that agony for souls,
that inexhaustible pity and love which will never
let one perish, for whom, by any extremity of sacrifice,
I can do anything?&#160; Do I breathe out the breath
of God upon those with whom I come in contact, making
the world feel that I have no harmony with any of
its aims or inclinations, but that I really belong
to Heaven?</p>

<p>By inference, rather than directly,
this life is a tremendous confirmation of the old
faith John Fletcher gained all he had because
he believed the Bible just as it stands He knew
from his own experience and from daily intercourse
with Him that the promises it contains come direct
from the mouth of God, and not from the &#8220;sublime
imagination&#8221; of some Jew poet, as the contemptible
deceivers of our day would have us believe If
there were any delusion about that old Book, then
John Fletcher was one of the most pitiful specimens
of a degraded superstition this world ever contained.&#160;
But where, amongst all the applauded doubt-preachers
of our day, is there to be found a man of love and
prayer and power approaching to this one?</p>

<p>Do not let us be discouraged as to
the possibility of a life as holy as this amidst the
circumstances of our rushing warfare John Fletcher
was, after all, only a thorough disciple of Him who
had not where to lay His head None of us are
called to live amidst denser crowds, more hurry, worry,
or contention of any sort than was the daily lot of
our Heavenly Master This book would draw us
farther from Him, not nearer, if it only made us thirst
for retirement and stillness, for hours of meditation
or privacy It is, not the imitation of Fletcher,
but the imitation of Christ to which these pages are
meant to call us Most of us may never possess
many of the charming traits of this most refined gentleman.&#160;
We may perhaps suit God&#8217;s purposes amidst the
rough crowd all the better for that But, depend
upon it, close intercourse with the Nazarene is as
possible amidst the throngs of London, or Glasgow,
or New York, or Madras, as it was in the alleys of
Jerusalem or Capernaum, and intimacy with Jesus is,
after all, the one thing needful for every disciple.</p>

<p>But whoever is red-hot will ceaselessly
be thinking and planning for the worst; that is to
say, not only for those commonly called the worst,
whose wild career of sin strikes all decent people
with horror, but for the far more seriously in danger,
who turn their very religion into a form or an amusement,
and care nothing for any real intercourse with God.&#160;
These are the people perhaps most difficult of all
to get at, the people whom we shall never be likely
to make any impression upon unless we combine with
the greatest possible activity an intensity of spiritual
heat and power of which we suppose Fletcher was one
of the grandest specimens the world ever had.&#160;
Do not let us resent or run away from any reproach
as to our own comparative coldness and inefficiency
which this story may bring to us How much better
to writhe and be aroused under any such reproofs now
than only to awake to them when life is slipping away!&#160;
Alas! for the readers who shall close this book without
resolving to be as holy and useful as God commands
us all to be!</p>

<h1>The Life of John Fletcher.</h1>

<a name="chapter1"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>

<h2>At the Castle</h2>

<p>In the nursery of a fine old Swiss
castle, on the shores of Lake Leman, stood a small
boy of seven, confronted by his white-capped nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a naughty boy!&#8221;
she exclaimed &#8220;Do you not know that the
devil is to take away all naughty children?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little fellow opened wide his
clear, truthful eyes, into which there crept a deepening
look of trouble&#8212;&#173;trouble rather than fear;
big tears rolled down his pinafore, and when tucked
away for the night, Jean Guillaume De La Fl&#233;ch&#232;re
crept out of his cosy cot, sank upon his knees, and
began the first real prayer of his life:&#160; &#8220;O
God, forgive me!&#8221;&#160; Nor would he be interrupted
until the inward sense of pardon comforted his sorrowing
little heart Many years later he described this
time as the shedding abroad of the love of God within
him.</p>

<p>Colonel De La Fl&#233;ch&#232;re&#8217;s family
mansion commanded as fine a view of Swiss scenery
as could be found in the neighbourhood &#8220;Hill
and dale, vineyards and pastures, stretched right
away to the distant Jura mountains At a few
paces from the ch&#226;teau was a terrace overlooking Lake
Leman, with its clear blue waters and its gracefully
curved and richly-wooded bays On the right hand,
at a distance of fifteen miles, was Geneva, the cradle
of the Reformation in Switzerland; on the left, Lausanne
and the celebrated Castle of Chillon High up
in the heavens were Alpine peaks, embosoming scenes
the most beautiful; and not far away was Mont Blanc,
&#8216;robed in perpetual and unsullied snow.&#8217;&#8221;
(Tyerman.)</p>

<p>In this earthly paradise the little
Jean received his first unconscious training, breathing
not only the clear mountain air into his lungs, but
a no less important atmosphere of refinement, of culture,
and of nobility into his mental and moral being.</p>

<p>He was devoted to his mother, who
could never say he wilfully disobeyed her One
day, however, she deemed him lacking in reverence
for her, because, when rebuking a member of the family
over-sharply, John turned upon her a long look of
evident reproof She promptly boxed his ears,
but was more than mollified when the boy lifted his
clear eyes to hers, brimful of tenderness, and said
simply, &#8220;Mother, when I am smitten on one cheek,
and especially by a hand I love so well, I am taught
to turn the other also.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not priggishness, but submissive
affection, and she read it aright.</p>

<a name="chapter2"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>

<h2>In the Manor House</h2>

<p>In the ch&#226;teau at Nyon Jean De La
Fl&#233;ch&#232;re was keeping his tenth birthday (September
12th, 1739) Away in old England the Lord of the
Manor of Leytonstone, Essex, was giving his first caresses
to a tiny baby girl, later to be known as little Mary
Bosanquet, and forty years later still as the wife
of the saintly John Fletcher, Vicar of Madeley.</p>

<p>Mary was but a four-year-old baby
when she received her first definite conviction that
God hears and answers prayer She was a timid
little maiden, and the greatest comfort she had in
the world was the fact that she possessed a real Father
in Heaven, strong, mighty, and willing to protect
and help her Sunday evenings in Forest House&#8212;&#173;as
the Bosanquet mansion was called&#8212;&#173;were devoted
to the children On those occasions Mary&#8217;s
father taught her sister and herself the Church catechism.&#160;
At five years old his youngest daughter asked questions
concerning true Christians according to the Word of
God, which might well have encouraged evasion on the
part of her parent She reasoned out everything
told her; but her eager and earnest questions being
so constantly put carelessly by, gave her childish
mind the impression that the Bible did not mean all
it said, therefore a sensible person would make due
allowance for its threatenings.</p>

<p>As this thought began to take well
hold of Mary, a Methodist girl entered the household
as nurse, whose conversations with the children were
a great enlightenment to them both.</p>

<p>In a year or two the nurse left them,
but not before she had implanted in little Mary&#8217;s
mind the truth that it was not being united to any
church or people which would save her, but that she
must be converted through faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and that the fruits of believing in Him as
a personal Saviour would be power to love and serve
God with a holy heart That was excellent, but
it had not been so explained to the child that she
could understand the process either of &#8220;faith&#8221;
or of &#8220;conversion.&#8221;&#160; The result was
perplexity.</p>

<p>Not a few children in bygone days
have had to suffer long Sunday afternoon agonies over
the harrowing pictures of Foxe&#8217;s &#8220;Book
of Martyrs,&#8221; this being then considered a profitable
and bracing Sabbatic &#8220;exercise&#8221; for hundreds
of sensitive little ones whose dreams were haunted,
and whose waking hours in the dark were rendered terrific
by vivid imaginings of racked, tortured, and burning
saints Mary was one of these Yet so troubled
was her little heart over the ungrasped subject of
faith that one day, while gazing upon these fearful
pictures, she exclaimed to herself, &#8220;Oh! oh!&#160;
I do think it would be easier to <i>burn</i> than
to <i>believe!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary seems to have been busy with
these thoughts for nearly two years She had
not passed her eighth birthday when we find her sitting
by herself for &#8220;a good think,&#8221; and wondering
&#8220;<i>What</i> can it mean to have faith in Jesus?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vexed with the mystery of the subject,
her childish soul rose in rebellion against God for
having chosen so hard a way into salvation, and she
exclaimed aloud&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I had to die a martyr,
I could do it; or give away all I have, I could do
that; or when I grow up to have to be a servant,  that
would be easy; but I shall never, never, <i>never</i>
know how to believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two lines of an old hymn drifted instantly
through her mind&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Who on Jesus relies, without money or
price,<br>
&#160;&#160;The pearl of forgiveness and holiness
buys.</p>

<p>It was the light she needed.&#160;
The Spirit of Love had taken pity upon the little
girl From that moment the plan of salvation was
clear to her, and she cried out&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, I do rely on Jesus; yes,
I <i>do</i> rely on Jesus; and God counts me righteous
for all He has done and suffered, and hath forgiven
all my sins!&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt that a great weight had been
lifted from her heart Before this it seemed
that everything in the world was easier than to believe,
now it appeared the simplest plan God could have devised.&#160;
Had there been but a kindly and understanding person
near to whom Mary could talk freely, she might have
been a happy, trusting little Soldier of Jesus from
that hour, but there was no one to help her into the
sunshine of a child&#8217;s daily faith and love and
service, and religion became to her rather a subject
for morbid thought Terribly afraid of sin, not
understanding temptation, wholly uninstructed how
to get victory over her temper and other failings,
she grew discouraged, and feared she had sadly grieved
God With all this shut up in her soul, perhaps
it was no wonder that her mother should sometimes
exclaim:&#160; &#8220;That girl is the most perverse
creature that ever lived; I cannot think what has
come to her.&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter3"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>

<h2>Early Adventures</h2>

<p>From the bathing-place of Nyon ch&#226;teau
a slim, tall lad shot out into the blue water, as
much at home there, evidently, as he had been while
racing on the terrace His long hair was bound
by a strong ribbon, which the active movements of
the swimmer at length loosened In some unexplainable
manner the ribbon caught and wound itself about the
boy&#8217;s feet, tying his head to his heels, and
rendering a full stroke impossible With all
his might he struggled and tore, but the bond only
grew tighter He was in deep water, no help within
call, and the awful thought came that there, in the
budding of his bright young life, he must be cut off
and die a helpless prisoner He stayed his struggles,
almost paralysed at the thought, and that instant the
ribbon gave way and he recovered himself.</p>

<p>Nor was that his only narrow escape
from death in the same lake Five miles from
the shore a rocky island reared its head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a fine feat to
swim there from land,&#8221; said young Fletcher to
four of his companions They agreed, and the five
set forth Fletcher and one other lad succeeded
in reaching the island, but found its smooth cliffs
sank so steeply into the water that there was no possibility
of climbing them Despairingly they swam around
the islet again and again, finding at last a bare
foothold to which they clung until a boat fetched
them off The other three could swim but half
the distance to the island, and would have sunk exhausted
had not a passing boat picked them up.</p>

<p>A third time young Fletcher narrowly
escaped drowning; on this  occasion it was in the
Rhine, where the river is wide and very rapid.&#160;
The current swept him far from home, nor could he land
for the sharp rocks on either hand At length
he was flung violently against one of the piles of
a powder mill, lost consciousness, and disappeared,
rising again on the other side of the mill (according
to an onlooker, who took out his watch) <i>twenty
minutes after</i> his head had vanished beneath the
water Surely a guardian angel accompanied Jean
De La Fl&#233;ch&#232;re in all his earthly wanderings!</p>

<p>Although a good rider and practised
swimmer, the life of this young fellow was not by
any means wasted in athletics and sport; he studied
hard to prepare himself for the University of Geneva,
succeeding most brilliantly His extraordinary
diligence, no less than his striking ability, distinguished
him among the other students, and he bore off first
prizes with ease, studying early and late that he might
acquire the knowledge he loved After leaving
the University he gave himself to the acquirement
of the German language, and studied Hebrew and higher
mathematics.</p>

<p>All this he did with the idea of becoming
a minister of the Gospel, but the more he thought
about the burden which he would assume by so doing,
the less he felt able for his suggested task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go into the army, Fletcher,&#8221;
pleaded some of his friends, and it was not long before
he turned the power of his clear brain to work upon
military engineering He became very keen on his
chosen profession, and at the time when Portugal was
despatching troops to Brazil, Fletcher hied himself
to Lisbon, gathered together a company of young Englishmen,
accepted a Captain&#8217;s commission, and agreed to
sail upon a certain day in the Portuguese Service.</p>

<p>His father, Colonel De La Fl&#233;ch&#232;re,
refused to sanction the step, or to supply him with
the money he requested for the enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go without it,&#8221;
he resolved, and counted the hours to the sailing
of the man-o&#8217;-war.</p>

<p>A day or two before the appointed
date a maid, who was serving him with breakfast, clumsily
dropped the tea-kettle upon his leg, scalding him
so severely that he had to take to his bed While
there the ship sailed, and in view of Fletcher&#8217;s
later life, it is a striking fact that she was never
heard of again.</p>

<p>Though desperately disappointed, Fletcher
was as keen as ever on becoming a soldier He
returned to Nyon, and, to his unbounded delight, learned
that his uncle had procured him a commission in the
Dutch Service, of which he was a Colonel.</p>

<p>Eagerly he made his way to Flanders,
grudging the days of travel which kept him out of
his ambition Bent though he was in rough-hewing
his way according to his desire, Providence was surely
shaping for him an end other than he planned.&#160;
On his arrival Fletcher found that peace was concluded;
his soldiering capabilities were no longer required.&#160;
Almost immediately his uncle died, and the door into
the military profession seemed closed to him for ever.</p>

<a name="chapter4"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>

<h2>A Sweet Girlhood</h2>

<p>Mary Bosanquet grew into sweet and
graceful girlhood &#8220;It is time she saw
the world,&#8221; decided her mother, and forthwith
preparations were made for her to accompany the family,
who were to spend three gay months in Bath She
dressed and danced as did the rest, but in the very
ball-room found herself thinking, &#8220;If I only
knew where to find the Methodists, or any who would
show me how to please God, I would tear off all my
fine things and run through the fire to them.&#160;
If ever I am my own mistress I will spend half the
day in working for the poor, and the other half in
prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not long after this Mary&#8217;s sister
visited a friend who declared herself recently converted,
and in her house Mary found her longed-for help and
counsel&#8212;&#173;"the greatest comfort of my life,&#8221;
as she expressed it.</p>

<p>Association with this Mrs. Lefevre,
who died when Mary was seventeen, led the girl to
declare to her father that she desired to lead a better
life than one of mere amusement, begging him to allow
her to be left at home when the family visited the
theatre and other scenes of gaiety The opposition
she met with was trying, but it served to strengthen
her for the career which was to open to her in later
life.</p>

<p>It was natural that Mary&#8217;s friends
should wish her to marry, but at the time when this
was first put before her she heard Mrs. Crosby (one
of Wesley&#8217;s helpers) speak upon the necessity
of holiness and the joy of a life fully devoted to
God With the gentleman who was striving to win
her affections life would never have been the sacred
thing Mary desired for herself, she therefore gave
up all thought of marriage, began to dress plainly,
and waited for God to show her <i>His</i> way.</p>

<a name="chapter5"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>

<h2>A New Life</h2>

<p>Checked in his military ardour, John
Fletcher turned his thoughts again to study.&#160;
His linguistic powers were great; it was to him a
cheerful distraction to join a party of students who
were proceeding to England to become familiar with
the language.</p>

<p>At the first English inn at which
they stayed Fletcher showed that simple confidence
in his brother-man which so distinguished his later
life by trusting a strange Jew with all his money for
the purpose of changing it into English coin.&#160;
His fellow-students exclaimed, &#8220;You will never
see another crown of it!&#8221; but whether or not
that quality in Fletcher which always expected the
very best from a man worked salvation in this case
as in many another, certain it is that the Jew returned
with the &#163;90 intact.</p>

<p>For eighteen months Fletcher studied
English at a school in Hertfordshire, and afterwards
became tutor to the two sons of a Member of Parliament
named Hill.</p>

<p>He little knew then how important
a link in the providential chain was that appointment.&#160;
Up to this time, although he had deeply appreciated
religion, had read his Bible and prayed much, using
any leisure he could gain between his ordinary studies
for the research of prophecy and the perusal of devotional
books, yet he lacked any experience of living union
with God; joy in Christ was an unknown bliss; the &#8220;peace
which passeth all understanding&#8221; was unrevealed
to him To his brother Henry he thus described
his condition:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;My feelings were easily excited,
but my heart was rarely affected, and I was destitute
of a sincere love to God, and consequently to my neighbour.&#160;
All my hopes of salvation rested on my prayers, devotions,
and a certain habit of saying, &#8217;Lord, I am a
great sinner; pardon me for the sake of Jesus Christ!&#8217;&#160;
In the meantime I was ignorant of the fall and ruin
in which every man is involved, the necessity of a
Redeemer, and the way by which we may be rescued from
the fall by receiving Christ with a living faith.&#160;
I should have been quite confounded if anyone had
asked me the following questions:&#160; &#8217;Do you
know that you are dead in Adam?&#160; Do you live to
yourself?&#160; Do you live in Christ and for Christ?&#160;
Does God rule in your heart?&#160; Do you experience
that peace of God which passeth all understanding?&#160;
Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart by the
Holy Spirit?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A vivid dream concerning the Day of
Judgment was used to arouse him, and for some days
he was so depressed and harassed in mind that he could
not settle to any occupation for long together.&#160;
Sunday arrived; no teaching demanded his mental application;
he wandered listlessly from place to place, miserable
and dejected At length he sat down to copy some
music The door opened and in walked the butler,
an old servant of the family, and a countryman of
Fletcher&#8217;s For a moment he paused, then
approaching the tutor, said firmly, but respectfully:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I am surprised that you,
who know so many things, should forget what day this
is, and that you should not be aware that the Lord&#8217;s
Day should be sanctified in a very different manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was a true Christian, deeply
humble, and full of zealous love for God The
knowledge of many things he had borne patiently for
Christ, coupled with the strange power with which he
spoke, smote the tutor with a sense of his own shortcomings,
and made him exclaim to his own heart, &#8220;I am
not renewed in the spirit of my mind, and without
this the death of Christ will not avail for my salvation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not long after this Mr. Hill went
up to London to attend Parliament, accompanied by
his tutor and family On the road they stayed
for a meal and to change horses at St. Albans, and
Fletcher went for a brisk walk through the streets
to stretch his limbs.</p>

<p>The horses were put to, but the tutor
did not appear After some delay the post-chaise
drove off, a horse being left in readiness for the
tutor to mount and ride after them When in the
evening he overtook the party, Mr. Hill enquired why
he stayed behind He replied, &#8220;As I was
walking I met with a poor old woman, who talked so
sweetly of Jesus Christ that I knew not how the time
passed away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall wonder,&#8221; said
Mrs. Hill, &#8220;if our tutor does not turn Methodist
by-and-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Methodist, Madame!&#8221; asked
he, puzzled; &#8220;pray what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the Methodists are a people
that do nothing but pray,&#8221; was her rejoinder;
&#8220;they are praying all day and all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they?&#160; Then by the
help of God I <i>will</i> find them out,&#8221; said
he decidedly.</p>

<p>He not only &#8220;found them out,&#8221;
but joined a Methodist society, meeting with them
whenever an opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>Fletcher could not readily rid himself
of the idea that &#8220;much doing&#8221; would make
him acceptable unto God Gradually, however, he
was brought to consider the value of &#8220;saving
faith,&#8221; and writes in his diary:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of going straight to
Christ I have lost my time in fighting against sin
with the dim light of reason, and the use of the means
of  grace I fear my notions of Christ are only
speculative, and do not reach the heart. <i>I never
had faith</i>, and without faith it is impossible
to please God Then every thought, word, and work
of mine have only been sin and wickedness before God,
though ever so specious before men All my righteousness
is as filthy rags I am a very devil, though
of an inferior sort, and if I am not renewed before
I go hence, hell will be my portion to all eternity....</p>

<p>&#8220;I begged of God to show me
all the wickedness of my heart, and to fit me for
His mercy I besought Him to increase my convictions,
for I was afraid I did not <i>mourn</i> enough for
my sins But I found relief in Mr. Wesley&#8217;s
Journal, where I learned that we should not build on
what we feel, but that we should go to Christ with
all our sins and all our hardness of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;On January 21st I began to
write a confession of my sins, misery, and helplessness,
together with a resolution to seek Christ even unto
death, but, my business calling me away, I had no heart
to go on with it In the evening I read the Scriptures,
and found a sort of pleasure in seeing a picture of
my wickedness so exactly drawn in the third chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans, and that of my condition
in the seventh; and now I felt some hope that God
would finish in me the work He had begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would have been strange if at this
important crisis the devil had let him alone.&#160;
In many ways the enemy fought for his soul Among
other hindrances he was beset with temptations to
evil thoughts, and, distressed beyond measure, he
cried to God with a <i>definite</i> faith which grew
out of the very desperateness of his immediate need
of help Hope grew within his cheerless soul,
for, as he says:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having withstood two or three
temptations, and feeling peace in my soul through
the whole of them, I began to think it was the Lord&#8217;s
doing Afterwards it was suggested to me that
it was great presumption for such a sinner to hope
for such a mercy I prayed I might not be permitted
to fall into a delusion; but the more I prayed the
more I saw it was real, for though sin stirred all
the day long, I always overcame it in the name of
the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the evening I read some
of the experiences of God&#8217;s children, and found
my case agreed with theirs, and suited the sermon I
had heard on Justifying Faith I called on the
Lord for perseverance and an increase of faith, for
still I felt some fear lest this should be all delusion.&#160;
Having continued my supplication till near one in the
morning, I then opened my Bible and fell on these words,
&#8217;Cast thy burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain
thee He will never suffer the righteous to be
moved.&#8217;&#160; Filled with joy, I fell on my knees
to beg of God that I might always cast my burden upon
Him I took up my Bible again, and fell on these
words, &#8217;I will be with thee; I will not fail
thee, neither forsake thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.&#8217;&#160;
My hope was now greatly increased, and I thought I
saw myself conqueror over sin, hell, and all manner
of affliction.</p>

<p>&#8220;With this beautiful promise
I shut my Bible, and as I shut it I cast my eye on
the words, &#8217;Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name
I will do it.&#8217;&#160; So, having asked perseverance
and grace to serve God till death, I went cheerfully
to take my rest.&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter6"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>

<h2>Given Up to the Fight</h2>

<p>Not content, as many are, with consciousness
of sins forgiven, Fletcher at once began to plead
that God would take fullest possession of his heart,
and grant to him a deeper experience of His love.&#160;
While lying upon his face in earnest prayer the Saviour
strangely manifested Himself to his eye of faith,
and it was revealed to him that Jesus had wondrously
become his soul&#8217;s inmost life, abiding in him
to conquer sin.</p>

<p>This completely changed his spiritual
position The blessed realisation that in Christ
he could triumph over sin and keep the world beneath
his feet, filled him with a glad sense of freedom.&#160;
He resolved that nothing should prevent him from experiencing
this to the full:&#160; he gave all his leisure to
prayer and meditation, living on vegetables, bread,
milk and water, that he might be able to save time
from the long courses of dinner, many a day lunching
in the garden from a piece of bread and a few bunches
of currants; also making it a rule to do without sleep
two nights of each week in order to pray.</p>

<p>This extremely rigid rule of life
was a mistake Lack of proper rest and food at
this period undoubtedly laid the foundation of his
subsequent delicacy Most men attend to the cravings
of the body to the expense of the lightly-fed soul;
all his life Fletcher gave less heed to physical needs
than his not-too-robust frame required, and he paid
the penalty.</p>

<p>As a natural gift, Fletcher possessed
a very sweet and gentle spirit Companionship
with Christ grafted upon this an unusual humility,
as simple as it was sincere An instance of this
is found in the fact that when the clergyman of Atcham
Church (which Fletcher attended while at Tern Hall)
invited adults who required instruction to join the
children&#8217;s catechumen class, gifted scholar though
he was, he stepped out and took his place by the little
ones as a matter of course, unmoved by the fact that
he was the only adult who did not despise the proffered
instruction.</p>

<p>Prayer, with Fletcher, was not a duty
but a refreshment and an inspiration Every Sunday
morning, between four and five, and two or three nights
in the week, after his pupils were asleep, he used
to go out into the meadows, or on to the banks of
the Severn, to meet an Excise Officer, a servant,
and a poor widow These four would pour out their
whole souls to God in prayer, and wonderful were the
manifestations of Divine love and grace vouchsafed
to them.</p>

<p>The poor of Atcham village and its
neighbourhood grew well accustomed to the fine, pure
face of the Tern Hall tutor; sickness always drew
him, and were there none at hand to nurse them as they
needed he was quick to give help.</p>

<p>Thus continually brought face to face
with the needs of ignorant and uncared-for men, it
was no wonder that Fletcher should return to the thought
(suggested to him many times previously) of devoting
himself altogether to ministering the gospel of the
grace of God Before taking any step towards
such a life, however, he asked the advice of John
Wesley, whom he already looked upon as his spiritual
guide Apparently the answer he received was
encouraging, for less than four months after he put
the question, John Fletcher was ordained as a clergyman
of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Straight from his ordination service
in the Chapel Royal at St. James&#8217;s, Fletcher
hurried to Snowsfields Methodist Chapel to assist
Wesley in a service there&#8212;&#173;a sufficiently
unusual commencement of a clergyman&#8217;s career!</p>

<a name="chapter7"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>

<h2>Turned from Home</h2>

<p>Mary Bosanquet&#8217;s determination
to lay aside the ordinary pleasures of girlhood, and
live a life of waiting upon God for the revelation
of His will, came just two months after John Fletcher&#8217;s
ordination Little enough happened to her for
a couple of years, save that she succeeded in increasingly
impressing those around her that it was useless to
invite her into paths of worldliness and frivolity.&#160;
When a girl of nineteen she stayed for seven weeks
in Bristol, renewing there her friendship with Miss
Sarah Ryan&#8212;&#173;to whom Fletcher wrote some of
his famous letters&#8212;&#173;through whom, and through
Mrs. Crosby, Mary was  introduced to her future husband.</p>

<p>When she came of age Mary Bosanquet
found herself mistress of her personal fortune, and
more strongly than ever was she assured that she might
do better work for God if she left her own home.&#160;
Always afraid of moving before the Guiding Pillar,
however, she feared exceedingly to take this step
unless the express command were laid upon her.</p>

<p>One day her father asked for her solemn
promise that she would not try to persuade her brothers
to follow Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I cannot promise
that, father,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will force me to put
you out of the house,&#8221; was his rejoinder.</p>

<p>In preparation for whatever might
follow, Mary took a lodging, and waited until she
should be told to go, which quickly happened.</p>

<p>It was a pathetic departure.&#160;
Before dinner a message reached her by a servant that
she had better go to her lodging that night During
the meal no word was said, and Mary&#8217;s heart
was wrung by sorrowful questionings &#8220;How
shall I go, if they say no more to me?&#160; How shall
I bear it, if they never invite me to see them again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dinner being at last concluded, and
the carriage announced, Mrs. Bosanquet swept out into
the hall, remarking casually to Mary as she passed
by :&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will, the coach, when
it has set us down, may carry you home to your lodgings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we shall be glad to see
you to dinner on Sunday,&#8221; added her father.</p>

<p>Mary choked and could not reply, but
she quickly recovered sufficiently to order her trunk
downstairs, and, when cloaked and hooded, she passed
down the staircase, she found all the servants assembled
in a row to bid her farewell with tears.</p>

<p>The two rooms she had taken were fireless,
dark, and unfurnished A table and candlestick
were quickly borrowed, and Mary sat down upon a broad
window-seat to ponder what was to her a strange situation.</p>

<p>By the time her maid arrived, and
invited her to a fire, and a sumptuous supper of bread,
rank salt butter, and water, God had so comforted
her and assured her of His favour and presence that
she was filled with thankfulness and peace; the empty
room and sparse, candle-lit meal seemed to her part
of &#8220;a little heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>No beds could be put up at so late
an hour; blinds and curtains were not in evidence.&#160;
Mary Bosanquet lay that night upon the bare floor,
and the pure, clear moonlight shone coldly upon her
as she lay, but the fire of Divine love burned warm
within her heart; she communed with her God in utter
content.</p>

<a name="chapter8"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>

<h2>The Tern Hall Tutor</h2>

<p>For three years after his ordination
Fletcher received no church appointment He remained
as tutor at Tern Hall, and preached wherever he could
find an opening, either in French or in English.</p>

<p>Amongst ordinary church-goers his
decided utterances made him far from popular, but
the warm hearts of the Methodist people bade him hearty
welcome, and these he learned to love truly and well.&#160;
They introduced him to &#8220;many honourable women,&#8221;
several of whom became his friends and correspondents;
none of them, however, impressed him as did Mary Bosanquet.</p>

<p>In writing to her brother nearly twenty-five
years later he said of this meeting:&#160; &#8220;It
was soon after my ordination that I saw Miss Mary
Bosanquet I had resolved not to marry, but the
sweetness of her temper and her devotedness to God
made me think that if ever I broke through my resolution
it would be to cast my lot with one like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>One may judge of the quiet but strong
influence Fletcher exerted in his neighbourhood by
an incident which happened during that autumn.&#160;
To Tern Hall one night came a messenger from Salop,
asking urgently for &#8220;the tutor.&#8221;&#160;
The letter he delivered bore no name, but it begged
Mr. Fletcher to hasten at once to a certain inn, where
he might find a soul who wanted God Without
a question the tutor set out on his five-mile walk,
not knowing whether beggar or duke demanded his help.&#160;
He found the eldest son of a baronet, whom God&#8217;s
Spirit had rendered so strangely wretched on account
of sin that he could neither eat nor sleep Doctors
had done their best to remove this remarkable malady,
but the one remedy lay in the touch of the hand of
the Great Physician, and, almost in despair, his soul
cried, &#8220;Oh, that I knew where I might find Him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The visit of that October night resulted
in correspondence which was blessed to Sir Richard
Hill&#8217;s conversion, although the young man became
in later years one of Fletcher&#8217;s most active
opponents in a doctrinal controversy.</p>

<p>This time of waiting for God to show
his future sphere of work was much blessed to Fletcher
in spiritually preparing him for it Through
an incident in which he was much misunderstood by many,
he learned the all-important lesson to a preacher,
that a sermon full of the most vigorous ideas is as
nothing if not inspired by the living Spirit.</p>

<p>His own account of the matter is brief
but instructive:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I was going to resume
my daily course of business I was called to preach
in a church at Salop, and was obliged to compose a
sermon in the moments I should have spent in prayer.&#160;
Hurry and the want of a single eye drew a veil between
the prize and my soul In the meantime Sunday
came, and God rejected my impure service and abhorred
the labour of my polluted soul; and while others imputed
my not preaching to the fear of the minister who had
invited me to his pulpit, and to the threatenings
of a mob, I saw the wisdom and holiness of God, and
rejoiced in that providence which does all without
the assistance of hurrying Uzzah.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the holidays Fletcher would
betake himself to London, giving all his time to service
in connection with a chapel in Seven Dials The
sermon he did not preach bore fruit in his own heart,
and to his beloved friend, Charles Wesley, he wrote:&#160;
&#8220;May God water the poor seed I have sown, and
give it fruitfulness, <i>though it be only in one
soul!</i> But I have seen so much weakness in my heart,
both as a minister and a Christian, that I know not
which is most to be pitied&#8212;&#173; the man, the
believer, or the preacher Could I at last be
<i>truly</i> humbled and <i>continue so always</i>,
I should esteem myself happy in making this discovery.&#160;
I preach <i>merely</i> to keep the chapel open until
God shall send a workman <i>after His own heart</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the famous earthquake of nine
years before a little Welsh girl named Mary Price
was then attending a London school The children
were frightened nearly out of their wits by the upheaval,
the crash of broken glass, the long subterranean rumbling,
and, in common with many London residents, in that
hour little Mary promised to serve God For nine
years she strove and prayed, but found no way by which
she could come near to Him Persuaded by a friend
who knew her inward sorrow, she sought out the despised
Methodist meeting-house in Seven Dials, and there
heard Fletcher preaching for his &#8220;one soul.&#8221;&#160;
Light flashed through all her being as she listened,
and that morning Mary Price saw the &#8220;Way&#8221;
to unerring &#8220;Truth&#8221; and everlasting &#8220;Life,&#8221;
entering later on into lifelong communion with Him
whom her spirit had so earnestly sought.</p>

<p>For fifty-nine years Mary was a shining
light in the kingdom of grace.</p>

<a name="chapter9"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>

<h2>The Vicar of Madeley</h2>

<p>At thirty years of age Fletcher was
pressed to become a missionary to Antigua, but was
prevented by the advice of Charles Wesley, who foresaw
for him a more useful service in England.</p>

<p>Introduced by John Wesley to the famous
Countess of Huntingdon, Fletcher was further commended
to her by the poet-brother in such a manner as led
her to urge him to become chaplain to her household.&#160;
On the understanding that the appointment should not
interfere either with his preaching, or the work he
had taken up amongst French prisoners and refugees,
he accepted the post, and through it became acquainted
with many great spirits who ranked amongst the noble
of the earth.</p>

<p>A great work was at this time being
done at Everton, the parish of the Rev John
Berridge, and Fletcher made special efforts to see
and profit by it He introduced himself to the
noted clergyman as a convert seeking instruction and
advice Berridge, noting his foreign accent,
asked him his nationality.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Swiss from the Canton of Berne,&#8221; was
the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Berne!&#160; Ah, then you
can give me some account of a young countryman of
yours, one John Fletcher, who has lately preached a
few times for the Mr. Wesleys, and of whose talents,
learning, and piety they both speak in terms of high
eulogy Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him intimately, and
did those gentlemen know him as well they would not
speak of him in such terms, for which he is more obliged
to their partial friendship than to his own merits,&#8221;
was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me,&#8221; objected
Berridge, &#8220;in speaking so coldly of a countryman
in whose praises they are so warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the best of reasons
for speaking of him as I do&#8212;&#173;I am John Fletcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berridge melted at this, and insisted
upon his occupying his pulpit the following morning.&#160;
For three days Fletcher remained at Everton, joined
there by the Countess of Huntingdon and two well-known
clergymen, Martin Madan and Henry Venn The services
were, perforce, held in the open-air, for on the third
day ten thousand persons gathered to hear the word
of God Many fell to the ground overpowered by
the influence of the Spirit, and numbers cried for
mercy.</p>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s life as a tutor now
ended Mr. Hill was extremely anxious to benefit
him, and to this end offered him the living of Dunham,
in Cheshire, explaining that the duty was light, the
income &#163;400 a year (a good sum in those days), and
the surrounding country delightful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunham will not suit me,&#8221;
said Fletcher quietly; &#8220;there is too much money
and too little labour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#160; Would
you like Madeley?&#160; My nephew is the patron, and
I am sure the present Vicar would be only too glad
to exchange it for anything so good as Dunham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would suit me exactly,&#8221;
quoth Fletcher, kindling at the thought He had
preached there, and knew the rough character of its
colliers and forgemen.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the old Vicar of
Dunham died suddenly The day after the event
Mr. Hill met his nephew at the Shrewsbury races, and
in that unlikeliest place of all, it was arranged
that the Madeley living should be presented to Fletcher.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that he
should consult his friend Charles Wesley, but though
he longed, if God so led, to undertake the work, he
feared greatly that many who were violently opposed
to some of his views would resist the appointment,
and that the greatest barrier of all, the Bishop of
Lichfield, would refuse to countersign his testimonials.</p>

<p>An extract from one of his letters
to the Countess of Huntingdon shows how all these
obstacles were removed:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;The difficulty of getting proper
testimonials, which I had looked upon as insurmountable,
vanishes at once; the three clergymen that had opposed
me with the most bitterness signed them; the Bishop
of Lichfield countersigns them without the least objection;
the lord of the manor, my great opposer, leaves the
parish; and the Vicar, who told me that I should never
preach in that church, now recommends me to it, and
tells me he will induct me himself Are not these
the intimations of the will of God?&#160; It seems
so to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came to pass that in the parish
book was made the following entry:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>John Fletcher, clerk, was
inducted to the vicarage of Madeley the 17th of October,
1760.&#8212;&#173;John Fletcher, Vicar.</i>&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter10"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>

<h2>An Alarmed Parish</h2>

<p>In the same month as Mary Bosanquet
was cast out of her father&#8217;s home to commence
life anew as a toiler for God, John Fletcher settled
down to his work in the parish of his choice.</p>

<p>Madeley lies three or four miles from
the foot of the Wrekin in a winding glen, through
which flows the River Severn So far it was a
place of beauty, but in no other sense The colliers
and iron-workers of Coalbrookdale and Madeley were
ignorant, brutal, and much given to drunkenness and
profanity The Sabbath was ignored, decency frequently
flouted, bull-baiting a favourite pastime, and religion
a matter of coarse ridicule and bitter scorn.&#160;
After their day&#8217;s work the inhabitants frequently
held nights of revelry, lasting until dawn, when dancing,
drunkenness, and obscenity reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Fletcher commenced his campaign with
great earnestness and zeal He had no idea of
contenting himself with preaching to a handful of
feeble folk twice upon a Sunday; he counted every day
lost if he had not in it brought some of his people
face to face with the requirements of God In
cottages, at street corners, or in the church, he
held a service just as often as he could gather sufficient
people together; he visited the public-houses, and
even appeared at the midnight carousals, warning men
of the wrath of God, and urging them to flee to Jesus
for mercy.</p>

<p>The parishioners of Madeley grew decidedly
uncomfortable They desired nothing so much as
to be left alone, and the influence of this new parson
was a force with which they found it necessary to reckon.&#160;
They grew to dread the sudden opening of their tavern
and dance-room doors, and the appearance of the pale,
pure-faced man, whose eyes glowed like coals, and
whose words burned and stung as he rebuked sin.</p>

<p>They were not used to being continually
confronted with the claims of God; they did not relish
the urgency with which Fletcher insisted upon <i>conversion</i>
rather than church-going They turned upon him
in public; they maligned him in private; they disturbed
his informal meetings; they cursed his name.&#160;
One thing they were bound to do, however, they respected
his courage and goodness, and that alone was sufficient
eventually to turn the tide.</p>

<p>It was a lonely time for Fletcher.&#160;
He was a young man, with no companion; he was of cultured
mind, and greatly missed some kindred intelligence
and friendly spirit with which he might commune of
the things which pressed upon his soul Little
wonder that his heart should turn towards the sweet-spirited
woman whose face dwelt in his memory with gentle persistence.&#160;
He looked upon the idea of marriage, however, as a
snare to draw his thoughts from his work, and he fought
it down as something unworthy of his high calling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am driven to the Lord,&#8221;
he wrote to the Countess of Huntingdon, &#8220;and
He comforts, encourages, and teaches me The devil,
my friends, and my heart have pushed at me to make
me fall into worldly cares and creature snares . .
. but I have been enabled to cry, &#8217;Nothing but
Jesus and the service of His people,&#8217; and I trust
the Lord will keep me in the same mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher lived with the utmost frugality,
for some time doing without even a servant, and taking
his meals at a neighbour&#8217;s house An idea
of his simplicity of life may be gained from a story
told by one who was at a boarding-school at Madeley
which Mr. Fletcher frequently visited:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;One morning he came in just
as the girls had sat down to breakfast He said
but little while the meal lasted, but when it was finished
he spoke to each girl separately, and concluded by
saying to the whole, &#8217;I have waited some time
on you this morning, that I might see you eat your
breakfast; and I hope you will visit me to-morrow morning
to see how I eat mine.&#8217;&#160; He told them his
breakfast-hour was seven o&#8217;clock, and obtained
a promise that they would visit him Next morning
they went at the time appointed, and seated themselves
in the kitchen Mr. Fletcher came in quite rejoiced
to see them On the table stood a small basin
of milk and sops of bread Mr. Fletcher carried
the basin across the kitchen and sat down on an old
bench He then took out his watch, laid it before
him, and said, &#8217;My dear girls, yesterday morning
I waited on you a full hour while you were at breakfast;
I shall take as much time this morning in eating my
breakfast as I usually do, if not rather more.&#160;
Look at my watch!&#8217;&#160; He immediately began
to eat, and continued in conversation with them.&#160;
When he had finished he asked how long he had been
at breakfast They said, &#8217;Just a minute
and a-half, sir.&#8217;&#160; &#8216;Now, my dear girls,&#8217;
said he, we have fifty-eight minutes of the hour left,&#8217;
and he then began to sing&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Our life is a
dream!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our time as a
stream<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Glides swiftly
away,<br>
&#160;&#160;And the fugitive moment refuses to stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this he gave them a lecture
on the worth of time and the worth of the soul.&#160;
They then all knelt down in prayer.&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter11"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XI.</h1>

<h2>The Vicar&#8217;s Sermons.</h2>

<p>The Vicar of Madeley led no idle life.&#160;
He started Friday evening lectures; on Sunday afternoon
he catechised the school-children, spent many hours
of every day in visiting the sick and poor, and hesitated
not at all to sit up whole nights with any who lacked
attention To the careless landowners and farmers
whom he failed to get into his church he addressed
the first of his published sermons, with a preface
which urged them to <i>read</i> his message if they
would not listen to it.</p>

<p>With Fletcher there was no preaching
against the absent wrong-doer, no haranguing evil
in the abstract, but there was never lacking a definite
and personal denouncement of present and personal sin.&#160;
One tremendous word loomed large before his hearers,
nor could any misunderstand when he talked about <i>sin</i>,
and the arousing thought was pressed ever closer to
them by his pointed use of the word <i>you</i>.&#160;
Here is an example:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever make a prey of
the poor and helpless?&#160; Are you like the horse-leech,
ever crying, &#8216;Give, give!&#8217; still wanting
more profit, and never thinking you have enough?&#160;
Do you take more care to heap up treasure on earth
than in Heaven?&#160; Have you got the unhappy secret
of distilling silver out of the poor man&#8217;s brow,
and gold out of the tears of helpless widows and friendless
orphans?&#160; Or, which is rather worse, do you, directly
or indirectly, live by poisoning others, by encouraging
the immoderate use of those refreshments which, if
taken to excess, disorder the reason, ruin the soul,
and prove no better than slow poison to the body?&#160;
If your business calls you to buy or sell, do you
use falsehoods? do you equivocate? do you exaggerate
or conceal the truth in order to impose upon your
neighbour, and make a profit of his necessity or credulity?&#160;
If any of these marks be upon you, God&#8217;s word
singles you out and drags you to the bar of Divine
justice to hear your doom in the text, &#8217;<i>The
wicked shall surely die</i>.&#8217;&#160; Oh, see your
danger; repent and make restitution!&#160; Why should
you meet the unjust steward in Hell, when you may yet
follow Zacchaeus into Heaven?...</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your conscience bears
you witness that you are not a swearing Christian,
or rather a swearing infidel Well, but are you
clear in the point of adultery, fornication, or uncleanness?&#160;
Does not the guilt of some vile sin, which you have
wickedly indulged in time past, and perhaps are still
indulging, mark you for the member of a harlot, and
not the member of Christ?&#160; Do you not kindle the
wrath of Heaven against yourself and your country,
as the men and women of Gomorrah did against themselves
and the other cities of the plain?&#160; If you cherish
the sparks of wantonness, as they did, how can you
but be made with them to suffer the vengeance of eternal
fire?&#160; Do not flatter yourselves with the vain
hope that your sin is not so heinous as theirs.&#160;
If it be less in degree, is it not infinitely greater
in its aggravating circumstances?&#160; Were these
poor Canaanites <i>Christians</i>?&#160; Had they Bibles
and ministers?&#160; Had they sermons and sacraments?&#160;
Did they ever vow, as you have done, to renounce the
devil and all sinful lusts of the flesh?&#160; Did
they ever hear of the Son of God sweating great drops
of blood, in an agony of prayer, to quench the fire
of human corruption?&#160; Oh, acknowledge your guilt
and danger, and by deep repentance prevent infallible
destruction!&#8221;</p>

<p>Faithful and fearless utterances such
as these made him famous, but not popular:&#160; inconsistent
professors resented them deeply; open sinners raged
at the unsparing denunciations which they could not
fail to appropriate, yet out of the latter class came
some of Fletcher&#8217;s best and most encouraging
converts.</p>

<p>Much of his success in getting men
to listen to unpalatable truths lay in his gentleness
of manner and rare humility of mind, but &#8220;gentlest
of human beings&#8221; as he has been described, he
had the courage of a lion in fight, and for his Master&#8217;s
sake he knew no palliation of unrighteousness, even
though his truth-telling made the bitterest of enemies.</p>

<p><i>By nature</i> Fletcher was not
a meek man; he had &#8220;a fiery passionate spirit,&#8221;
says one of his biographers, &#8220;insomuch that he
has frequently thrown himself on the floor, and lain
there most of the night bathed in tears, imploring
victory over his own temper And he did obtain
the victory, in a very eminent degree For twenty
years and upwards before his death no one ever saw
him out of temper, or heard him utter a rash expression
on any provocation whatever... I never saw him
in any temper in which I myself would not have wished
to be found at death.&#8221;</p>

<p>A friend who lived for some time in
his house writes thus:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;His enemies wrested his words,
misrepresented his actions, and cast out his name
as evil; but whether he was insulted in his person
or injured in his property; whether he was attacked
with open abuse or pursued with secret calumny, he
walked amid the most violent assaults of his enemies,
as a man invulnerable, and while his firmness discovered
that he was unhurt, his forbearance testified that
he was unoffended.&#8221;</p>

<p>To a man with talents trained as were
his, with a power of expression which could melt into
uncommon eloquence when he chose, with learning to
illuminate, judgment to balance his effects, and extreme
quickness of perception to adapt illustration and
appeal to any audience, Fletcher might have made for
himself a mighty name Instead of this, &#8220;his
design was to <i>convert</i> and not to <i>captivate</i>
his hearers; to secure their eternal interests, and
not to obtain their momentary applause... He
spake as in the presence of God, and taught as one
having Divine authority There was an energy in
his preaching that was irresistible His subjects,
his language, his gestures, the tone of his voice,
and the turn of his countenance, all conspired to
fix the attention and affect the heart Without
aiming at sublimity, he was truly sublime, and uncommonly
eloquent without affecting the orator.&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter12"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XII.</h1>

<h2>Scanty Encouragements.</h2>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s encouragements at
Madeley were at first sufficiently scanty to have
disheartened many an earnest man.</p>

<p>Two Marys were amongst his earliest
converts Mary Matthews, of Madeley Wood, went
to hear him with the mind of the Pharisee, but she
left his presence with the heart of the publican.&#160;
Having obtained the pardon of her sins, she opened
her little house for preaching, and stood firm, although
threatened by some of the villagers with a drum-led
mob, and eventually haled before the magistrates and
fined &#163;20 for the offence of turning her cottage into
a conventicle.</p>

<p>Mary Barnard, a lame old women of
ninety, counted no pain or distance too great to prevent
her from making her toilsome journey to the church
where she &#8220;first saw the light,&#8221; and, uneducated
as she was,  her definite testimony to the power of
the cleansing Blood often cheered the preacher who
had blessed her.</p>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s methods were unique
for the times in which he lived There was no
hiding from him Those who tried to escape his
influence by avoiding his preachings were pursued
into their various haunts and homes under all kinds
of circumstances and at all hours Some pretended
that they could not awake in time to get ready for
his early services; he responded by going out himself
with a bell and sounding such clashing peals in various
parts of the parish that there remained no shadow
of excuse for their sleeping after 5 a.m.!</p>

<p>He adopted the practice of dealing
with criticisms and objections from the pulpit, a
course sufficiently unusual to attract much attention
to what he had to say.</p>

<p>Work as he might, however, Fletcher
received so little encouragement that he was frequently
burdened with the fear lest he had mistaken the Divine
appointment.</p>

<p>One day, when he was much oppressed
in this way, he was summoned to bury a parishioner.&#160;
At once he lost sight of his own trouble in the opportunity
of dealing out red-hot truths to a crowd of people.&#160;
One man was so convicted that he broke out into a
storm of bad language, fighting as best he knew how
the strange influences of the Spirit These were
too strong for him, however, and he melted into tears
of penitence How gladly the Vicar gave him the
pardon he asked for his behaviour, and led him further
still into the joy of sins forgiven, can never be
told From that time he became an active helper
in the parish, and one of Fletcher&#8217;s greatest
encouragements.</p>

<p>The conversion of this man, however,
seemed only the signal for greater opposition on the
part of some of the colliers A number of them
were baiting a bull near Madeley Wood Meeting-house
one night when he was expected there to preach.&#160;
&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait here and <i>bait the parson!</i>&#8221;
they cried, settling at once who should pull him off
his horse, and who should set the dogs upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher, all unsuspectingly,
prepared for his walk to the wood, but on the threshold
was met by a messenger who had forgotten to give notice
of the burial of a child who was even then being carried
up for its funeral Here was a duty which could
not be put off; the Vicar stayed to attend to it,
and so missed his preaching appointment.</p>

<p>The men waited in vain, then repaired
to a public-house to drink and curse their ill-luck.&#160;
As they swore horrible oaths a huge china punch-bowl
standing in the room fell in small fragments.&#160;
This so impressed one of the number that he rose and
left the place, vowing there and then to break with
his old companions, and seek the salvation of his
soul.</p>

<p>A somewhat well-known story is connected
with Fletcher&#8217;s sensitiveness to the influence
of the Spirit with regard to his message for men.&#160;
He had entered the pulpit one Sunday morning at Madeley
to preach a sermon prepared for the purpose, when
all remembrance of it fled; he could not even recall
the text Instantly throwing himself upon the
Spirit of God for guidance, he turned to the First
Lesson for the day, which happened to be the history
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego As soon as
he began to make some remarks upon it thoughts flowed,
words burned, and he found himself so strangely upheld
and inspired that he felt certain God intended the
word for someone of whom he was not himself aware.&#160;
So sure did he become of this fact that he requested
to be privately informed if this were the case.</p>

<p>Three days later a woman called at
the vicarage and told him that she had for some time
been greatly concerned about her soul through attending
his services Her husband noticed her habits of
private prayer, and in a violent rage threatened her
with frightful consequences if she did not refrain
from her church-going She told him her conscience
would not allow that, and with terrible oaths he cried,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut your throat as soon as you come
back, if you go!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor woman only prayed the harder,
and when Sunday morning came she dressed herself for
church as usual As she passed through the kitchen
her husband bellowed out, &#8220;I shall not cut your
throat as I said, I shall heat the big oven and throw
you into it the minute you get back.&#8221;&#160; To
the accompaniment of savage swearing she closed the
door and made her way to the church, praying all the
time that God would strengthen her to suffer whatever
might befall her.</p>

<p>In grateful amaze she drank in every
word of Fletcher&#8217;s impromptu talk upon the three
martyrs in the fiery furnace, and to herself she cried
softly, &#8220;If I had a thousand lives I&#8217;d
lay them all down for Jesus!&#8221;</p>

<p>Knowing the brutal nature of her husband&#8212;&#173;a
butcher by trade&#8212;&#173;she was quite prepared
for the worst that might happen to her, but God kept
her in utter and perfect peace when she actually saw
flames issuing from the oven She was even <i>joyful</i>
as she opened the door to death.</p>

<p>Then, to her unspeakable astonishment,
she saw her husband upon his knees, beseeching God
to pardon his sins He caught her in his arms,
crying, &#8220;Forgive me, wife; oh, forgive me if
you can!&#8221; turning from her only to cry yet more
earnestly to God for the mercy he had been led by
the Spirit Himself to seek.</p>

<p>With here and there such incidents
to cheer him, Fletcher found, after two years of rough
work and numberless hindrances, that public respect
was taking the place of open opposition, and the word
of truth, sown  in difficulty and hardness, was beginning
to bring forth fruit in many hearts Wesley says
of him:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having chosen this narrow field
of action, he was more and more abundant in his ministerial
labours, both in public and in private, not contenting
himself with preaching, but visiting his flock in every
corner of his parish And this work he attended
to, early and late, whether the weather was fair or
foul, regarding neither heat nor cold, rain nor snow,
whether he was on horseback or on foot But this
farther weakened his constitution, which was still
more effectively done by his intense and uninterrupted
studies, in which he frequently continued with scarce
any intermission fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen hours
a day But still he did not allow himself such
food as was necessary to sustain nature He seldom
took any regular meals, except he had company; otherwise,
twice or thrice in four and twenty hours he ate some
bread and cheese or fruit Instead of this, he
sometimes took  a draught of milk, and then wrote
on again When one reproved him for not affording
himself a sufficiency of necessary food, he replied,
&#8217;Not allow myself food?&#160; Why, our food seldom
costs my housekeeper and me together less than two
shillings a week!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter13"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XIII.</h1>

<h2>The Orphan Home</h2>

<p>Isolated as was the life she lived
at Hoxton, Mary Bosanquet was not wholly severed from
her parents At intervals her father would drive
up in his carriage, bringing her some present and renewing
his  persuasions to her to live at home upon the terms
of spiritual silence on which he had previously insisted.&#160;
But though, to all appearance peculiarly alone, the
two years spent in her solitary lodging was a time
of the richest blessing, during which she entered into
such communion with God as influenced the whole of
her after-life.</p>

<p>An almost curious sensitiveness to
the sorrows and needs of men so possessed her that
all consideration of self or repining at her condition
was entirely shut out, and with this insight into the
woe of the world came a wonderful baptism of Divine
love God became all in all to her soul, and
she lived in the spirit of Gerhardt&#8217;s inspired
hymn:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Oh, grant that nothing in my soul<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May dwell but Thy pure love
alone;<br>
&#160;&#160;Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My joy, my treasure, and my
crown!&#160;<br>
&#160;&#160;Strange flames far from my heart remove,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My every act, word, thought,
be <i>love</i>!</p>

<p>It was inevitable that her Methodist
friends should suggest to her a  less lonely life;
some of them, indeed, went so far as to speak of her
in connection with Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if I were to marry <i>him</i>,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;he would be a help and not a hindrance
to my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>She little knew that Fletcher had
been fighting the same thought Indeed, it was
not long after this that, in answer to Charles Wesley&#8217;s
practical suggestion, that a wife would be helpful
in his lonely work, Fletcher drew up as quaint a set
of <i>Reasons for and Against Matrimony</i> as have
ever been committed to paper:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>For</i>.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;1 A tender friendship is, after
the love of Christ, the greatest<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;felicity of life; and
a happy marriage is nothing but such a<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;friendship between two
persons of different sexes.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;2 A wife might deliver me from the
cares of housekeeping, <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;3 Some objections and scandals may
be avoided by marriage.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;4 A pious and zealous wife might
be as useful as myself; nay, she<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;might be much more so
among my female parishioners, who greatly<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;want an inspectress.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Against</i>.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;1 Death will shortly end all particular
friendships The happier<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the state of marriage,
the more afflicting is the widowhood;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;besides, we may try
a friend and reject him after trial; butwe<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cannot know a wife till
it is too late to part with her.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;2 Marriage brings after it a hundred
cares and expenses; children,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;a family, <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;3 If matrimony is not happy, it
is the most fertile source of<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;scandal.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;4 I have a thousand to one to fear
that a wife, instead of being a<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;help, may be indolent,
and consequently useless; or humoursome,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;haughty, capricious,
and consequently a heavy curse.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Mary Bosanquet, towards
the end of these two years there came to London her
friend Mrs. Ryan (housekeeper of Wesley&#8217;s new
Room at Bristol), who fell ill, was nursed by her with
great devotion, and afterwards taken home to share
her rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I acknowledge,&#8221; she writes,
&#8220;I neither gained honour, gold, nor indulgence
to the flesh by uniting myself to a sickly, persecuted
saint; but I gained such a spiritual helper as I shall
eternally praise God for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after their union a house
of Miss Bosanquet&#8217;s at Leytonstone became vacant,
and in March, 1763, the Friends moved into it, and
began private and public meetings under their own roof-tree.</p>

<p>One evening, as Miss Bosanquet was
speaking to a large company assembled in her kitchen,
the fore-gate bell clashed with a mighty peal.&#160;
The servant went to answer it, and meantime there strode
through the back door into the kitchen four ill-looking
men with clubs in their hands The servant hurried
back trembling, saying that a messenger had come to
warn them of a great mob coming to upset them, the
ringleaders being four men with clubs.</p>

<p>Mary Bosanquet cast a glance at her
audience and answered the maid aloud, &#8220;Oh, we
do not mind mobs when we are about our Master&#8217;s
business &#8217;Greater is He that is for us
than all that can be against us.&#8217;&#8221; Then
calmly she continued her subject, unhindered by any.</p>

<p>Having upon her table a few copies
of the simple &#8220;Rules for the Society of the
People called Methodists,&#8221; she handed one of
them to each of the four ringleaders, begging their
acceptance that at their leisure they might see the
nature of the profession made by the worshippers.&#160;
They received them with respectful bows, and no more
was heard of &#8220;mobs&#8221; for that night.</p>

<p>The house was a lonely one, open on
one side to the forest, and in it at that time lived
only Mary Bosanquet, Mrs. Ryan, a maid, and Sally
Lawrence, a little child of four years, whom Miss Bosanquet
had taken from her mother&#8217;s coffin to her own
warm care When the nights became dark, a disorderly
crowd would gather at the gate to pelt the worshippers
with dirt, afterwards invading the yard to reach the
unshuttered windows, where they would roar like so
many wild beasts But the protecting hand of
God kept them from any real bodily harm &#8220;The
Lord was with us,&#8221; wrote the lady of the house
most sweetly, &#8220;and preserved us under Love&#8217;s
almighty shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Sally was the first of many
orphans who followed Through various misfortunes
and deaths around her, Miss Bosanquet quickly found
herself mothering six of them The number grew
until twenty children and several grown people found
a home beneath her hospitable roof at one time.&#160;
This family involved much nursing, for there were
never more than six in the house in perfect health.</p>

<p>Miss Bosanquet adopted for the whole
household what was almost a uniform of dark purple
cotton; she fed them upon simple diet, kept them to
regular hours for meals and employment, trained the
children for service, and nursed sick people until
they were well Hers was indeed a House of Mercy!</p>

<h2>A Seeker after God</h2>

<p>Five years had passed since Fletchcr
entered Madeley as its Vicar, and with the result
of his labours he was  anything but satisfied.</p>

<p>Of the fifth year he wrote:&#160; &#8220;This
last year has been the worst I have had here&#8212;&#173;barren
in convictions, fruitful in  backslidings.&#8221;&#160;
And to the same correspondent (Miss Hatton, of Wem)
he wrote later:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;The coming of Mr. Wesley&#8217;s
preachers into my parish gives me no uneasiness.&#160;
As I am sensible that everybody does better, and is
more acceptable than myself, I should be sorry to
deprive anyone of a blessing; and I rejoice that the
work of God goes on, by <i>any instrument</i>, or
in <i>any place</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was characteristic of him&#8212;&#173;ever
depreciative of self, and rejoicing in other men&#8217;s
labours.</p>

<p>Not only Wesley&#8217;s itinerants,
but the great preacher himself visited Madeley, and
it is significant that the straight-speaking old man
did not take the same pessimistic view of Fletcher&#8217;s
work as he did himself After preaching to crowds
of his people, Wesley speaks of Madeley as a great
and encouraging &#8220;prospect.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;There
are many adversaries indeed,&#8221; writes the Father
of Methodism, &#8220;but yet they cannot shut the
open and effectual door.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not for lack of invitation,
but rather because he was so engrossed in his work
that the Vicar of Madeley had up to this time confined
his labours to his own parish Now, however, he
was persuaded to make an evangelistic visit to Breedon,
in Leicestershire, also to Bath and Bristol.</p>

<p>While in Bath&#8212;&#173;conducting
an extension of the opening services of Lady Huntingdon&#8217;s
new chapel&#8212;&#173;he wrote his first Pastoral Letter
to his flock at home Never were letters written
less to please the ear, or to make a bid for the affections
of a people; honest, faithful exhortations they were,
plain to hurting-point, but made of wonderful blessing
to those to whom they were read A sample of one
will be of interest:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of you wonder why you
cannot believe, why you cannot see Jesus with the
eye of your mind, and delight in Him with the affections
of your heart I apprehend the reason to be one
of these, or perhaps altogether:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;1 You are not poor, lost,
undone, helpless, despairing sinners in yourselves.&#160;
You indulge spiritual and refined self-righteousness;
you are not yet dead to the law, and quite slain by
the commandment Now the Kingdom of Heaven belongs
to none but the poor in spirit Jesus came to
save none but the lost What wonder, then, if
Jesus is little to you, and if you do not live in
His kingdom of peace, righteousness, and joy in the
Holy Ghost?</p>

<p>&#8220;2 Perhaps you spend your
time in curious reasonings, instead of casting yourselves
as forlorn sinners at the feet of Christ, leaving
it to Him to bless you when and in the manner He pleases.&#160;
Know that He is the wise and Sovereign God, and that
it is your duty to lie before Him as clay, as fools,
as sinful nothings.</p>

<p>&#8220;3 Perhaps, also, some
of you wilfully keep idols of one kind or another;
you indulge some sin against light and knowledge; and
it is neither matter of humiliation nor of confession
to you The love of praise, that of the world,
that of money, and that of sensual gratifications,
when not lamented, are as implacable enemies to Christ
as Judas and Herod were How can ye believe, seeing
ye seek the honour that cometh from men?&#160; Hew,
then, your Agags in pieces before the Lord Run
from your Delilahs to Jesus resolutely Cut off
the right hand and pluck out the right eye that offends
you &#8217;Come out from among them, and be
ye separate, saith the Lord, and I will receive you.&#8217;&#160;
Nevertheless, when you strive, take care not to make
yourself a righteousness of your own striving.&#160;
Remember that justifying righteousness is finished
and brought in, and that your goodness can no more
add to it than your sins diminish it Shout then,
&#8217;the Lord your righteousness!&#8217;&#160; And
if you are undone sinners, humbly, and yet boldly,
say, &#8216;In the Lord have I righteousness and strength.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no false comforting, or
fine talk about &#8220;only believe&#8221; with John
Fletcher!&#160; If any lacked faith, he cut down to
the roots to find out why.</p>

<p>The preaching tours named were followed
by many others London, Brighton, and Oathall
were visited, in the first of which he officiated
for Whitefield in Tottenham Court Road Chapel.</p>

<p>We may judge by a letter to Whitefield
that he would have gone yet more frequently if he
could, as he remarks, &#8220;I should be glad to be
your curate some time this year, but I see no opening,
nor the least prospect of any What between the
dead and the living, <i>a parish ties one down more
than a wife</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not without distinguished visitors
at the vicarage, however, hostess though he had none;
the Countess of Huntingdon, accompanied by Lady Anne
Erskine and Miss Orton, accepted the frugal provision
for comfort with which John Wesley had previously
contented himself; the  scarlet coat and gold lace
of a famous officer of Dragoons (Captain Scott) was
seen in his garden&#8212;&#173;a man, by the way, who
preached daily to his soldiers, and frequently exhorted
in a Methodist meeting-house in the full blaze of
his regimentals&#8212;&#173;and was mounted by Fletcher
upon his horse-block to address large crowds which
gathered to hear him Whitefield was also expected,
but could not then avail himself of the invitation,
and, later on, he differed very seriously from the
Vicar regarding the doctrine of free salvation which
it was ever his glory to preach.</p>

<p>Before and beyond everything else
John Fletcher was <i>a seeker after God</i>.&#160;
To assist himself in this supreme endeavour he drew
up the following rules for nightly use:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>1 Did I awake spiritual, and
was I watchful in keeping my mind from wandering this
morning when I was rising?</p>

<p>2 Have I this day got nearer
to God in times of prayer, or have I given way to
a lazy, idle spirit?</p>

<p>3 Has my faith been weakened
by unwatchfulness, or quickened by diligence this
day?</p>

<p>4 Have I this day walked by
faith and eyed God in all things?</p>

<p>5 Have I denied myself in all
unkind words and thoughts?&#160; Have I delighted in
seeing others preferred before me?</p>

<p>6 Have I made the most of my
precious time, as far as I had light, strength, and
opportunity?</p>

<p>7 Have I kept the issues of
my heart in the means of grace, so as to profit by
them?</p>

<p>8 What have I done this day
for the souls and bodies of God&#8217;s dear saints?</p>

<p>9 Have I laid out anything to
please myself when I might have saved the money for
the cause of God?</p>

<p>10 Have I governed well my tongue
this day, remembering that &#8220;in a multitude of
words there wanteth not sin&#8221;?</p>

<p>11 In how many instances have I denied myself
this day?</p>

<p>12 Do my life and conversation
adorn the Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>By way of encouraging others to keep
themselves thus in touch with God, Fletchcr formed
what he called a <i>Religious Society</i>, into whose
fellowship he brought all he could whom he found desirous
of living the life of full salvation which he everywhere
advocated He laid before them a set of home-questions
which he urged upon them as a useful form of self-examination.&#160;
A sample of these will show how practical was the
religion he both lived and preached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I feel any pride?&#160; Am
I dead to all desire of praise?&#160; If any despise
me, do I like them the worse for it?&#160; Or if they
love and approve me, do I love them more on that account?&#160;
Is Christ the life of all my affections and designs,
as my soul is the life of my body?&#160; Have I always
the presence of God?...Am I saved from the fear of
man? .. Am I always ready to confess Christ,
to suffer with His people, and to die for His sake?...Am
I willing to give up my ease and convenience to oblige
others, or do I expect them to do so to my hours, ways,
and customs?...Do I never take that glory to myself
which belongs to Christ?...Am I courteous, not severe;
suiting myself to all with sweetness; striving to
give no one pain, but to gain and win all for their
good?...Do I perform the most servile offices, such
as require labour and humiliation, with cheerfulness?...Is
every thought brought into subjection to Christ?...Do
I think no evil, listen to no groundless surmises,
nor judge from appearances?&#160; How am I in my sleep?&#160;
If Satan presents any evil imagination, does my will
immediately resist or give way to it?&#160; Do I bear
the infirmities of age or sickness without seeking
to repair the decays of nature by strong liquors?&#160;
Or do I make Christ my sole support, casting the burden
of a feeble body into the arms of His mercy?&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XV.</h1>

<h2>Sanctified  Letter-Writing.</h2>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s correspondence was
an unusually heavy one; his letters make quite as
spiritual reading as his sermons, yet he gave the choicest
of reasons for <i>not</i> writing to one man who expected
a letter:&#160; &#8220;Tell Mr. Keen,&#8221; he wrote
to Whitefield, &#8220;I am a letter in his debt, and
<i>postpone writing it till I have had such a sight
of Christ as to breathe His love through every line</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many pearls of thought were contained
in these epistles; while the advice in them was quaintly
put, it was always helpful, and never hurled at random.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your dulness in private prayer,&#8221;
wrote he to Miss Hatton, &#8220;arises from the want
of familiar friendship with Jesus To obviate
it, go to your closet as if you were going to meet
your dearest friend; cast yourself at His feet, bemoan
your coldness, extol His love to you, and let your
heart break with a desire to love Him Get <i>recollection</i>
&#8212;&#173;a dwelling within ourselves&#8212;&#173;a
being abstracted from the creature and turned towards
God For want of such a frame, our times of prayer
are frequently dry and useless; imagination prevails,
and the heart wanders, whereas we pass easily from
recollection to delightful prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the same person, however, he recommended
the cultivation of a wholesome naturalness in religion
which would ensure acknowledgment of its beauty in
those around her:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no sin in <i>looking
cheerful</i>. &#8217;<i>Rejoice evermore</i>&#8217;;
and if it is our duty always to be <i>filled with
joy</i>, it is our duty to <i>appear</i> what we are
in reality I hope, however, your friends know
how to distinguish between <i>cheerfulness</i> and
<i>levity</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware of stiff singularity
in things <i>barely indifferent</i>:&#160; it is <i>self</i>
in disguise; and it is so much the more dangerous when
it comes recommended by a serious, self-denying, religious
appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is evident from a glance at his
correspondence that Fletcher&#8217;s extremely frugal
habits and large generosity to others gave not a little
anxiety to those who loved him A wealthy merchant
of Bristol, named Mr. Ireland, a constant, true, and
close friend, sent him a parcel of broadcloth as a
gift, beseeching him kindly not to send his coat again
to be patched His thanks were thus concluded:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your broadcloth can lap me
round two or three times; but the mantle of Divine
love, the precious fine robe of Jesus&#8217;s righteousness,
can cover your soul a thousand times The cloth,
fine and good as it is, will not keep out a hard shower;
but that garment of salvation will keep out even a
shower of brimstone and fire Your cloth will
wear out; but that fine linen, the righteousness of
saints, will appear with a finer lustre the more it
is worn The moth may fret your present, or the
tailor may spoil it in cutting it, but the present
which Jesus has made you is out of reach of the spoiler,
and ready for present wear Let me beseech you,
my dear friend, to accept of this heavenly present
as I accept of your earthly one I did not send
you one farthing to purchase it; it came unsought,
unasked, unexpected, as the seed of the woman came.&#160;
It came just as I was sending a tailor to buy me cloth
for a new coat, and I hope when you next see me it
will be in your present; now let Jesus see you in
His Accept it freely Wear no more the
old rusty coat of nature and self-righteousness.&#160;
Send no more to have it <i>patched</i> Make
your boast of an unbought suit, and love to wear the
livery of Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Fletcher&#8217;s letters all
tended to the same point as his sermons&#8212;&#173;a
personal appeal to the soul to whom he addressed himself.&#160;
To the Rev Joseph Benson he wrote:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;The few professors I see in
these parts are so far from what I could wish them
and myself to be, that I cannot but cry out, &#8217;Lord,
how long wilt Thou give Thine heritage to desolation
and barrenness?&#160; How long shall the heathen say,
Where is now their indwelling God?&#8217;&#160; I hope
it is better with you in the north What are
your heart, your pen, your tongue doing?&#160; Are
they receiving, sealing, spreading the truth everywhere
within your sphere?&#160; Are you dead to praise or
dispraise?&#160; Could you quietly pass for a mere
fool, and have gross nonsense fathered upon you without
any uneasy reflection of self?&#160; The Lord bless
you!&#160; Beware of your grand enemy, earthly wisdom
and unbelieving reasonings You will never overcome
but by child-like, loving simplicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>In writing to his schoolmaster at
Madeley, the Vicar gives a real home-thrust, yet in
so kindly a manner that it could hardly be resented:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were not a minister I
would be a <i>schoolmaster</i>, to have the pleasure
of bringing up children in the fear of the Lord.&#160;
That pleasure is yours, relish it, and it will comfort
and strengthen you in your work The joy of the
Lord and of charity is our strength Salute the
children from me, and tell them I long to show them
the way to happiness and Heaven Have you mastered
the stiffness and shyness of your temper?&#160; Charity
gives a <i>meekness, an affability, a child-like
simplicity and openness</i>, which nature has denied
you Let me find you shining by these virtues,
and you will revive me much God bless your labour
about the sheep and the lambs!&#8221;</p>

<p>An insight into his own persevering
way of working may well be gained from the directions
he give&#8217;s in a letter written from Bristol to
Mr. Wase, of Madeley:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My dear brother</i>,&#8212;&#173;Go
to Mrs. Cound, and tell her I charge her, in the name
of God, to give up the world, to set out with all speed
for Heaven, and to join the few about her who fear
God If she refuses, call again; call weekly,
if not daily, and warn her from me till she is ripe
for glory... Give my love to George Crannage;
tell him to make haste to Christ, and not to doze
away his last days.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the whole of his parishioners he
wrote, on one occasion, an epistle through which we
gain a glimpse of the tenderness and beauty of his
spirit, chastened still more, as it then was, by affliction:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My dear companions</i>
<i>in tribulation</i>,&#8212;&#173;All the children
of God I love; but of all the children of God, none
have so great a right, to my love as you Your
stated or occasional attendance on my poor ministry,
as well as the bonds of neighbourhood, and the many
happy hours I have spent with you before the throne
of Grace, endear you peculiarly to me. . . .</p>

<p>&#8220;I sometimes feel a desire of
being buried where you are buried, and of having my
bones lie in a common earthen bed with yours; but I
soon resign that wish, and exult in thinking that,
whatever distance there may be between our graves,
we can now bury our sins, cares, doubts, and fears,
in the one grave of our Divine Saviour If I,
your poor unworthy shepherd, am smitten, be not scattered,
but rather be more closely gathered unto Christ, and
keep near each other in faith and love, till you all
receive our second Comforter and Advocate, the Holy
Ghost, the third Person in our <i>Covenant God.</i>
He is with you; but if you plead the promise of the
Father, &#8216;which,&#8217; says Christ, &#8217;ye
have heard of Me, He will be <i>in</i> you.&#8217;&#160;
He will fill your souls with His light, love, und
glory, according to that verse which we have so often
sung together:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Refining Fire, go through my heart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illuminate my soul;<br>
&#160;&#160;Scatter Thy life through every part,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And sanctify the whole.</p>

<p>&#8220;This indwelling of the Comforter
perfects the mystery of sanctification in the believer&#8217;s
soul This is the highest blessing of the Christian
covenant on earth Rejoicing in God our Creator,
in God our Redeemer, let us look for the full comfort
of God our Sanctifier So shall we live and die
in the faith, going on from faith to faith, from strength
to strength, from comfort to comfort, till Christ is
all in all to us all.&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVI.</h1>

<h2>An unfortunate purchase</h2>

<p>Mary Bosanquet was doomed to suffer
through her friends She was greatly tried by
interfering advisers, and through ill-given counsel
she took steps which caused anxieties to thicken and
debts to accumulate It was anything but an easy
life, yet it was illuminated by wonderful answers
to prayer On one occasion she had to find a
large sum of money in the course of a day or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better borrow it until
your own half-yearly cheque comes in,&#8221; said
Mrs. Ryan.</p>

<p>They tried, but were unsuccessful.&#160;
Miss Bosanquet went to prayer, and it seemed to her
as if the Lord Jesus Christ stood by her side and
repeated some words she had lately read:&#160; &#8220;Christ
charges Himself with all your temporal affairs, while
you charge yourself with those that relate to His
glory.&#8221;&#160; Such power accompanied the utterance
as &#8220;wiped away every care,&#8221; as she put
it to herself While yet she thanked her Lord
for His promise a knock came to her door A man
had called to bring her just the amount she needed.</p>

<p>Not a little trouble came to Mary
Bosanquet through a Miss Lewen who stayed in her house,
received much good, and was nursed through an illness
which proved unto death.</p>

<p>Many ill-natured persons credited
the kindly hostess with an effort to secure Miss Lewen&#8217;s
fortune for her work, but the reverse was the case,
she having cost the little House of Mercy many pounds
without contributing anything towards it.</p>

<p>A man named Richard Taylor was her
next trial&#8212;&#173;a debtor and  improvident, with
a wife and family of small children Being recommended
to her good graces, he stayed for a time in her household
while trying to arrange with his creditors He
accompanied Miss Bosanquet, Mrs. Ryan, and Mrs. Crosby
upon a troublesome journey to Yorkshire, taken with
the double purpose of benefiting Sarah Ryan&#8217;s
fast-failing health, and of seeking a larger and more
suitable Orphan Home than the one in Leytonstone.&#160;
The latter object was accomplished, but Mrs. Ryan
gradually sank, and to her friend&#8217;s great sorrow
they had to bury her in the old churchyard of Leeds.</p>

<p>The northern Home involved three times
the work required by the other; wheat had to be ground
to flour before home-made bread could be baked, cows
managed and milked, men-servants overlooked; all the
details, in fact, of a country house and a large household
came under review This alone would have brought
more than enough responsibility, but on the advice
of Richard Taylor and another Yorkshire friend, Miss
Bosanquet unfortunately bought a farm with malt-kilns
attached, and began to build a house suitable for
the size of her family.</p>

<p>The investment turned out an unhappy
failure The work of God prospered mightily,
but the settling of Taylor&#8217;s affairs cost her
between &#163;200 and &#163;300; the house was an inn-of-call
for all Methodists travelling through the district
(which could not be without incurring much expense);
the farm and kilns swallowed increasingly large sums
of money, and Taylor was an extravagant manager.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the unfailing
kindness and help of a gentleman who many times proposed
to Miss Bosanquet in vain, she would have come out
of the affair penniless Friends greatly urged
this marriage upon her Her rule in these cases
was to ask herself, &#8220;Should I be holier or happier
with this man?&#8221;&#160; The answer was invariably
&#8220;No!&#8221; and in this particular instance
the thought of her saintly friend at Madeley arose
to make the idea doubly disagreeable to her.</p>

<p>In great distress, she began to live
on bread and water in order to economise, and go no
further into debt, but the night following this forlorn
effort God came very near and comforted her with the
promise of deliverance in a way she knew not.&#160;
She says:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;He showed me (by a light on
my understanding) that all my trials were appointed
by Himself; that they were laid on by weight and measure,
and should go no farther than they would work for my
good.. I had depended on creatures for help,
and therefore He had let me feel the weight of my
burdens, that I might be constrained to cast them afresh
on Him; and that, when He had proved and tried me,
He would deliver me from all my outward burdens.&#160;
As a pledge of the inward liberty He would afterwards
bring me into, and that the ways and means of my deliverance
were in His own hands, and should appear in the appointed
time, those words were again brought powerfully to
my mind&#8212;&#173;&#8217;If thou ...put away iniquity
far from thy tabernacles... Yea, the Almighty
shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of
silver...and shalt lift up thy face unto God....&#160;
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
unto thee; and the light shall shine upon thy ways.&#8217;...It
was a profitable and melting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, even in the midst of her troubles,
was Mary Bosanquet comforted of God.</p>

<a name="chapter17"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XVII.</h1>

<h2>The College of Trevecca.</h2>

<p>An important episode in the life of
John Fletcher was his association with the College
of Trevecca, opened by the Countess of Huntingdon,
for young men who desired to devote themselves to the
service of Christ A gratuitous education for
three years, with lodging, board, and clothing, was
provided for each student, the young men being afterwards
free to enter whatever church they preferred.</p>

<p>Above all, it was important that the
College should have a President whose advice could
be relied upon concerning the choice, conduct and
work of both masters and students&#8212;&#173;practically
an unsalaried head of affairs To this post was
called the Vicar of Madeley, and though naturally
unable to be resident in the College, he accepted the
duties of President, and, as such, gave most valuable
service.</p>

<p>A little later than this Fletcher
undertook to be Chaplain (one of three) to the Earl
of Buchan, who was known as one of the most devoted
Christians of his rank.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these duties, Fletcher&#8217;s
work became increasingly itinerant in character.&#160;
Wesley says:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;For many years he regularly
preached at places eight, ten, and sixteen miles off,
returning the same night, though he seldom got home
before one or two in the morning At a little
Society which he had gathered about six miles from
Madeley, he preached two or three times a week, beginning
at five in the morning... In some of his journeys
he had not only difficulties, but dangers likewise,
to encounter One day, as he was riding over
a wooden bridge, just as he got to the middle thereof,
it broke in The mare&#8217;s forelegs sank into
the river, but her breast and hinder parts were kept
up by the bridge In that position she lay as
still as if she had been dead, till he got over her
neck and took off his bags, in which were several MSS.,
the spoiling of which would have occasioned much trouble.&#160;
He then endeavoured to raise her up, but she would
not stir till he went over the other part of the bridge.&#160;
But no sooner did he set his feet upon the ground
than she began to plunge Immediately the remaining
part of the bridge broke down and sunk with her into
the river But presently she rose and swam to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other adventures befell Fletcher in
his travels, some of them ending in the narrowest
escapes from injury and death.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1770
Fletcher visited Italy, France, and his native Switzerland,
with his friend Mr. Ireland Few details are
preserved, but it seems to have been an uncommonly
lively tour Mr. Ireland tells of the Vicar&#8217;s
enthusiasm for unmasking various practices of the
Italian priests, which placed them frequently in danger
of their lives.</p>

<p>During this trip they met with a classical
scholar who said he had &#8220;travelled all over
Europe, and had passed through all the societies in
England to find a person whose life corresponded with
the Gospels and with Paul&#8217;s Epistles.&#8221;&#160;
Almost defiantly he demanded of Mr. Ireland if he
knew a single clergyman or Dissenting minister in his
native land possessed of &#163;100 a year who would not
desert his living for any other if offered double
that amount Mr. Ireland triumphantly pointed
to his travelling companion, saying, &#8220;<i>That</i>
man would not!&#8221;</p>

<p>The traveller turned to Mr. Fletcher
and began a religious argument, which the two kept
up at intervals for a whole week The Vicar overcame
his opponent again and again, and though the latter
lost his temper continually over his repeated defeats,
the calm, sweet reasonableness of Fletcher&#8217;s
spirit, as much as the overwhelming weight of his
arguments for Jesus Christ, made a lasting impression
upon his mind Eight years later he showed his
appreciation by becoming the Vicar&#8217;s host in
Provence, and treating him with the greatest reverence
and attention.</p>

<p>While in Paris he was sent for to
visit a sick woman Information having been given
to a magistrate which ascribed to him wrong motives,
a garbled case was got up, and an order of apprehension
was issued from the King An officer called at
the house where the friends were staying to serve
the order Mr. Ireland stepped out and, without
mentioning his name, said quietly, &#8220;Sir, have
you an order for me?&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I have,&#8221;
responded the officer, taking him for Fletcher.&#160;
They went off together, and Mr. Fletcher was well
out of the city before the magistrate disgustedly
discovered the mistake.</p>

<p>When in the south of France, Fletcher
determined to visit the Protestants of the Cevennes
Mountains, and nothing would serve him but that he
should perform the long and difficult journey on foot,
with but a staff in his hand He disdained to
appear well cared for, and on horseback, at the doors
of those whose fathers were hunted for their faith
from rock to rock He set out in his own fashion,
therefore; on the first night of his travels begging
the use of a chair in some humble cottage until morning.&#160;
The peasant was reluctant to admit his strange guest,
but when he had heard him talk and pray, himself, no
less than his wife and children, were affected to tears.&#160;
&#8220;I nearly refused to let a stranger into my
house,&#8221; related the peasant to his neighbours,
&#8220;but when he came I found more angel than man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor was this the only person who held
such an opinion Wesley tells of another visit
paid by the Vicar upon his way to call upon a minister
of the district A little crowd was assembled
at the door of a house where a mother and her newly-born
child were dying The room was also filled with
neighbours Fletcher went in, spoke gently to
the people present of the effects of the sin of our
first parent, and pointed them to Jesus &#8220;Jesus!&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;He is able to raise the dead,
to save you all from sin, to save these from death.&#160;
Come, let us ask Him!&#8221;</p>

<p>In prayer he had wondrous liberty.&#160;
The child&#8217;s convulsions ceased, the mother became
easy, and strength flowed into her as he prayed.&#160;
The neighbours gazed astonished, and silently withdrew,
whispering to one another when without the house,
&#8220;<i>Certainly it was an angel!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>On their journey from France to Italy
the travellers arrived at the Appian Way Fletcher
stopped the carriage and descended, remarking to his
friend, &#8220;I cannot <i>ride</i> over ground where
the Apostle Paul once <i>walked,</i> chained to a
soldier;&#8221; and taking off his hat he walked up
the old Roman road praising God for the glorious Gospel
preached by His servant of long ago.</p>

<p>Nor was this affectation upon Fletcher&#8217;s
part Nothing was further from his thoughts at
any time than to <i>make an impression</i> upon those
around him Perhaps for this very reason the mark
he did make was indelible No man ever spent
an hour with the Vicar of Madeley without being spiritually
better for it.</p>

<p>Arrived at Nyon, he was pressed to
occupy several pulpits Crowds flocked after
him from place to place, sinners were awakened, scoffers
silenced, and many were brought to seek Jesus as the
only Saviour.</p>

<p>One aged minister besought him to
prolong his visit, if only for an additional week.&#160;
When assured it was impossible, he turned to Mr. Ireland
with tears running down his cheeks &#8220;Oh,
sir,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;how unfortunate for
my country!&#160; During my lifetime it has produced
but one angel of a man, and now it is our lot to. lose
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parting from these good people
was almost overwhelming Some of the multitude
which gathered to say good-bye followed the carriage
for over two miles, unwilling to lose sight of one
who had brought them so near to God.</p>

<p>More than ordinary welcome awaited
him at Trevecca Joseph Benson&#8212;&#173; headmaster
of the College, and Fletcher&#8217;s biographer in
latter days&#8212;&#173; wrote of it thus:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was received as an angel
of God It is not possible for me to describe
the veneration in which we all held him Like
Elijah in the schools of the prophets, he was revered;
he was loved; he was almost adored; not only by every
student, but by every member of the family.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, indeed, he was worthy.
. .  Though by the body he was tied down to
earth, <i>his whole conversation was in Heaven</i>.&#160;
His <i>life</i>, from day to day, was <i>hid with
Christ in God.</i> Prayer, praise, love, and zeal,
all ardent, elevated above what one would think attainable
in this state of frailty, were the element in which
he continually lived As to others, his one employment
was to call, entreat and urge them to ascend with
him to the glorious source of being and blessedness.&#160;
He had leisure, comparatively, for nothing else.&#160;
Languages, arts, sciences, grammar, rhetoric, logic,
even divinity itself, were all laid aside when he
appeared in the schoolroom among the students.&#160;
His full heart would not suffer him to be silent.&#160;
He <i>must</i> speak, and they were readier to hearken
to this servant and minister of Jesus Christ than
to attend to Sallust, Virgil, Cicero, or any Latin
or Greek historian, poet, or philosopher they had
been engaged in reading And they seldom hearkened
long before they were all in tears, and every heart
catched lire from the flame that burned in his soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;These seasons generally terminated
in this Being convinced that to be &#8216;filled
with the Holy Ghost&#8217; was a better qualification
for the ministry of the Gospel than any classical
learning...after speaking awhile in the schoolroom,
he used frequently to say, &#8217;As many of you as
are athirst for the fulness of the Spirit, follow me
into my room.&#8217;&#160; On this, many of us instantly
followed him, and there continued till noon, <i>for
two or three hours</i>, praying for one another till
we could bear to kneel no longer... I have sometimes
seen him...so filled with the love of God that he
cried out, &#8217;O my God, withhold Thy hand, or
the vessel will burst!&#8217;&#160; But he afterwards
told me he was afraid he had grieved the Spirit of
God, and that he ought to have prayed that the Lord
would have enlarged the vessel, or have suffered it
to break, that the soul might have had no further bar
to its enjoyment of the Supreme Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few headmasters have had the opportunity
to speak of the President of their college as the
headmaster of Trevecca was led to do of Fletcher.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XVIII.</h1>

<h2>A Pen of Power</h2>

<p>Early in the new year of 1771 the
happy relations of Fletcher and Wesley with the Countess
of Huntingdon were shattered by unfortunate differences
in theology, Mr. Fletcher, held by certain utterances
of Wesley against Calvinistic doctrine, finding himself,
as a result, obliged to resign his Presidency of Trevecca
College Circumstances, regretted most of all
by himself, drew Fletcher into a long Calvinian controversy,
and to the publication of his famous &#8220;Checks
to Antinomianism,&#8221; and remarkable and closely-reasoned
vindication of the doctrines by which he held, abounding
in the plainest of plain speech.</p>

<p>The Calvinian controversy was long
and bitter, being succeeded by a Unitarian controversy,
which became equally prominent Both disturbances
were productive of much discussion, of many pamphlets,
of &#8220;Vindications,&#8221; and &#8220;Answers,&#8221;
and &#8220;Circulars,&#8221; and &#8220;Letters.&#8221;&#160;
Into this word-war Fletcher was drawn much against
his own preference, but when once the fight had been
entered upon, it was almost impossible for him to
extricate himself until it was fought out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a world!&#8221; he wrote
to Benson; &#8220;methinks I dream when I reflect
that I have written on controversy; the last subject
I thought I should have meddled with I expect
to be smartly taken in hand and soundly drubbed for
it Lord, prepare me for it, and for everything
that may make me cease from man, and, above all, from
your unworthy servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enemies there were, not a few, who
rejoiced at an opportunity of hurling abuse at a good
man&#8212;&#173;some of the sharp and stinging things
they said amounted to actual slander To know
how keen was the fight, how bitter and provoking the
attacks made, one must read the correspondence and
pamphlets then issued; but in the midst of it all
Wesley was able to write of his friend:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rejoice not only in the abilities,
but in the temper, of Mr. Fletcher He writes
as he lives I cannot say that I know such another
clergyman in England or Ireland He is all fire,
but it is the fire of love His writings, like
his constant conversation, breathe nothing else, to
those who read him with an impartial eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The controversy was much to be deplored
on account of the personal element brought in at all
points, yet Fletcher&#8217;s clear and eloquent writings
in his &#8220;Checks&#8221; was a fine service rendered
to the Christian faith Once more to quote Wesley:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;In his &#8216;Checks to Antinomianism,&#8217;
one knows not which to admire most &#8212;&#173;the
<i>purity</i> of the language, the <i>strength</i>
and <i>clearness</i> of the argument, or the <i>mildness</i>
and <i>sweetness</i> of the spirit that breathes through
the whole Insomuch that I nothing wonder at
a serious clergyman, who, being resolved to live and
die in his own opinion, when he was pressed to read
them, replied, &#8217;No, I will never read Mr. Fletcher&#8217;s
&#8220;Checks,&#8221; for if I did I should be of
his mind.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In January, 1773, a memorial letter
was written to the Vicar of Madeley by John Wesley,
asking him to become his successor as leader and head
of the Methodist people Indeed, the venerable
Father of Methodism would have had his instant aid,
for his letter concludes:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without conferring, therefore,
with flesh and blood, come and strengthen the hands,
comfort the heart, and share the labour of &#8220;Your
affectionate friend and brother, &#8220;<i>John Wesley</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s response was tentative;
not wholly a refusal, yet not an acceptance:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not leave this place,&#8221;
he concluded, in reply, &#8220;without a fuller persuasion
that the time is <i>quite</i> come Not that God
uses me much here, but I have not yet sufficiently
cleared my conscience from the blood of all men.&#160;
Meantime, I beg the Lord to guide me by His counsel,
and make me willing to go anywhere, or nowhere, to
be anything, or nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help by your prayers till you
can bless by word of mouth, Rev. and dear Sir, your
willing, though unprofitable servant in the Gospel.</p>

<p align="center">&#8220;J.&#160;
<i>Fletcher</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wesley was greatly against his saintly
friend hiding his light under the bushel of a country
vicarage Thirteen years later he wrote his own
opinion of Fletcher&#8217;s mission:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was full as much called
to sound an alarm through all the nation as Mr. Whitefield
himself Nay, abundantly more so, seeing he was
far better qualified for that important work.&#160;
He had a more striking person, equally good breeding,
an equally winning address, together with a richer
flow of fancy, a stronger understanding; a far greater
treasure of learning, both in languages, philosophy,
philology, and divinity; and, above all (which I can
speak with fuller assurance, because I had a thorough
knowledge both of one and the other), a more deep
and constant communion with the Father, and with the
Son, Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before a year had passed Fletcher&#8217;s
health began to fail, and he was glad to devote himself
to the writing which proved so useful and convincing.&#160;
To Mr. Ireland he wrote:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;My throat is not formed for
the labours of preaching When I have preached
three or four times together it inflames and fills
up; and the efforts which I am then obliged to make
heat my blood Thus I am, by nature, as well
as by the circumstances I am in, obliged to employ
my time in writing a little O that I may be enabled
to do it to the glory of God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing he wrote more fully
conduced to that lofty purpose than his famous &#8220;Polemical
Essay on the Twin Doctrines of Christian Imperfection
and a Death Purgatory&#8221;; than which few clearer,
more convincing, or more able vindications of Scriptural
holiness have ever been written Can aught be
plainer than the definition of Christian perfection
which follows:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;...Christian perfection is
nothing but the depth of evangelical repentance, the
full assurance of faith, and the pure love of God and
man shed abroad in a faithful believer&#8217;s heart,
by the Holy Ghost given unto him, to cleanse him,
and to keep him clean, &#8217;from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit&#8217;; and to enable him to
 fulfil the law of Christ&#8217; according to the
talents he is entrusted with, and the circumstances
in which he is placed in this world... This is
evident from the descriptions of Christian perfection
which we find in the New Testament.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a practical, almost homely, manner,
Fletcher deals with questions we often hear put to-day.&#160;
For instance :&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>How many baptisms, or effusions
of the sanctifying Spirit, are necessary to cleanse
a believer from all sin, and to kindle his soul into
perfect love?...</i> If you asked your physician how
many doses of physic you must take before all the
crudities of your stomach can be carried off, and
your appetite perfectly restored, he would probably
answer you that this depends upon the nature of those
crudities, the strength of the medicine, and the manner
in which your constitution will allow it to operate,
and that, in general, you must repeat the dose, as
you can bear, till the remedy has fully answered the
desired end I return a similar answer:&#160; If
one powerful baptism of the Spirit &#8216;seals you
unto the day of redemption,&#8217; and &#8217;cleanses
you from all&#8217; moral &#8216;filthiness,&#8217;
so much the better If two or more are necessary,
the Lord can repeat them.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Which is the way to Christian
perfection?&#160; Shall we go to it by internal stillness,
agreeably to the direction of Moses and David ...
or shall we press after it by an internal wrestling
according to the commands of Christ?...</i> The way
to perfection is by the due combination of prevenient,
assisting free grace, and of submissive, assisted
free will... &#8216;God worketh in you to will
and to do,&#8217; says St. Paul Here he describes
the passive office of faith, which submits to, and
acquiesces in, every divine dispensation and operation.&#160;
&#8216;Therefore work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling,&#8217; and, of consequence, with haste,
diligence, ardour, and faithfulness... Would
ye then wait aright for Christian perfection?&#160;
Impartially admit the two Gospel axioms, and faithfully
reduce them to practice In order to this, let
them meet in your hearts, as the two legs of a pair
of compasses meet in the rivet which makes them one
compound instrument... When your heart quietly
rests in God by faith, as it steadily acts the part
of a passive receiver, it resembles the leg of the
compasses which rests in the centre of a circle; and
then the poet&#8217;s expressions, &#8216;restless,
resigned&#8217; ("<i>Restless, resigned, for God I
wait; for God my vehement soul stands still</i>."&#8212;&#173;Wesley),
describes its fixedness in God But when your
heart swiftly moves towards God by faith, as it acts
the part of a diligent worker; when your ardent soul
follows after God, as a thirsty deer does after the
water-brooks, it may be compared to the leg of the
compasses which traces the circumference of a circle;
and then these words of the poet, &#8216;restless&#8217;
and &#8216;vehement,&#8217; properly belong to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Christian perfection to
be instantaneously brought down to us? or are we gradually
to grow up to it?&#160; Shall we be made perfect in
love by an habit of holiness suddenly infused into
us, or by acts of feeble faith and feeble love so
frequently repeated as to become strong, habitual,
and evangelically natural to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Such are the difficulties with which
Fletcher deals, patiently and fully turning them inside
out, comparing and contrasting, defining and enlarging,
leading the reader step by step to the conclusion that
Christian perfection is essentially the perfection
of <i>love</i>, love, &#8220;the highest gift of God,
humble, gentle, patient love,&#8221; shed abroad in
the heart of the believer by the perpetual anointing
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>As he finds his climax in Wesley&#8217;s
words, let us read them in the sense of his own quotation:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;All visions, revelations, manifestations
whatever, are little things compared to love....&#160;
The Heaven of heavens is love There is nothing
higher in religion; there is, in effect, nothing else.&#160;
If you look for anything but more love, you are looking
wide of the mark, you are getting out of the royal
way And when you are asking others, &#8217;Have
you received this or that blessing?&#8217; if you mean
any thing but more love, you mean wrong; you are leading
them out of the way, and putting them upon a false
scent Settle it, then, in your heart, that, from
the moment God has saved you from all sin you are to
aim at nothing but more of that love described in
1 Cor. xiii You can go no higher than this till
you are carried into Abraham&#8217;s bosom.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the Greenwood family, with
whom Fletcher frequently stayed, made a reference
to this production of his thought, which it were well
to remember:&#160; &#8220;Whoever has had the privilege
of observing Mr. Fletcher&#8217;s conduct will not
scruple to say that <i>he was a living comment on
his own account of Christian perfection</i>....&#160;
As far as man is able to judge, he did possess perfect
humility, perfect resignation, and perfect love.&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter19"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XIX.</h1>

<h2>Failing Health</h2>

<p>Unwilling as he might be for further
controversy, Fletcher quickly discovered that he had
not yet done with it Toplady, Vicar of a Devon
village, and so-called author of &#8220;Rock of Ages,&#8221;
bitterly attacked a tract of Mr. Wesley&#8217;s on
Predestination, referring to some of his own Calvinian
heresies Wesley had neither time nor inclination
to wage a paper war with an angry man The work
was undertaken by Fletcher, who found himself plunged
afresh into the troubled waters of religious controversy.&#160;
In his very Introduction Fletcher refuses to have
anything to say to the personal charges vindictively
hurled by his opponent:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;These charges,&#8221; he writes,
&#8220;being chiefly founded upon Mr. Toplady&#8217;s
logical mistakes, they will, of their own accord, fall
to the ground as soon as the mistakes on which they
rest shall be exposed May the God of truth and
love grant that if Mr. Toplady has the honour of producing
the best arguments, I, for one, may have the advantage
of yielding to them!&#160; To be conquered by truth
and love is to prove conqueror over our two greatest
enemies&#8212;&#173;error and sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then proceeds to deal with each
of Toplady&#8217;s <i>seventy-three</i> arguments
in favour of Predestination, abolishing them one by
one, but in a cool, calm, reasonable way which contrasts
nobly and sweetly with the angry prejudice of the
other.</p>

<p>His preaching tours were interfered
with by this work, but he deemed himself to be doing
as much, if not more, for God by pouring the daylight
of heavenly reason upon the errors which darkened the
minds, narrowed the perspective, and burdened the
hearts of so many in that day of Calvinian controversy.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Fletcher&#8217;s
next essay was into the arena of <i>political</i>
strife&#8212;&#173;or, as he terms it, &#8220;Christian
politics"&#8212;&#173; being led thereto by a pamphlet
of Wesley&#8217;s upon the American War of Independence
then raging He thoroughly prepared himself, not
unnecessarily, for the storm which was to follow; for
the minds of men were divided, and political speech
has ever tended to undue licence and heat.</p>

<p>The Government of George <i>iii</i>.,
however, considered that Fletcher had uttered words
as valuable as they were timely The Secretary
of State for the Colonies introduced the tract to
the Lord Chancellor, and he to the King It was
not long before Fletcher was asked if he would entertain
the idea of any preferment in the Church; was there
aught which the Lord Chancellor might do for him in
this way?&#160; His reply chimed with every act of
his life  &#8220;I want nothing,&#8221; answered
the saintly man; &#8220;nothing but more grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this time that Fletcher&#8217;s
health showed grievous signs of failure His
arduous toil, long journeys, close writing, and insufficient
food, had told all too surely upon a delicately-organised
frame A violent cough beset him, with slight
but frequent h&#230;morrhage.</p>

<p>John Wesley advised an open-air cure,
pressing him to spend some months on horse-back, touring
with him through parts of England and Scotland.&#160;
They set out together in the early spring, and travelled
1,100 or 1,200 miles in this way (not, however, into
Scotland), taking such journeys as were suited to
the invalid&#8217;s strength So greatly did
he profit by some weeks in the saddle that Wesley declared
if he would only have continued it for a few months
longer he would have become a strong man once more.</p>

<p>In May, 1776, however, we find him
at Bristol Hot Wells, debarred from his parochial
work Wesley suggested more saddle-cure, proposing
a five-hundred mile tour to Cornwall, but Fletcher
had by that time resigned himself to the hands of
a physician who forbade the exertion, being out of
sympathy with a remedy so far in advance of the times.</p>

<p>This medical adviser, however, mistook
his case, reducing him to great weakness A specialist
who then undertook him restored his strength somewhat
by more generous diet, although the relapse which followed
was so serious that his friends thought him to be dying,
and his congregation sang an intercessory hymn composed
for the occasion.</p>

<p>From his multiplicity of remedies
and advisers, however, Wesley rescued him once more,
put him in the saddle, and led him through Oxfordshire,
Northampton, and Norfolk, bringing him home greatly
benefited for the open air.</p>

<p>Fresh-air treatment, however, needs
wisely conducting in the untoward climate of England,
and a self-prescribed ride upon a winter&#8217;s day
of bitter frost threw Fletcher again into suffering
and danger Friends nursed him in London, and
a noted specialist was brought to him by Mr. Ireland,
whose kindness was ever unfailing; while two or three
physicians regularly attended and gave their best advice.&#160;
Rest, silence, and a diet of the richest milk seemed
most to help him, but it was a real sacrifice for
him to hold his peace concerning the intense love
of Jesus which filled his soul Often by signs
he would &#8220;stir up those about him to pray and
praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When he was able to converse,
his favourite subject was <i>the promise of the Father,
the gift of the Holy Ghost</i>, including the rich,
peculiar blessing of union with the Father and the
Son mentioned in the prayer of our Lord, recorded
in John xvii &#8217;We must not be content,&#8217;
said he, &#8217;to be only cleansed from sin; we must
be filled with the Spirit.&#8217;&#160; One asking
him, What was to be experienced in the full accomplishment
of <i>the promise</i> of the Father?&#160; &#8216;Oh,&#8217;
said he, &#8217;what shall I say?&#160; All the sweetness
of the drawings of the Father, all the love of the
Son, all the rich effusions of peace and joy in the
Holy Ghost, more than ever can be expressed are comprehended
here!&#160; To attain it, the Spirit maketh intercession
in the soul, like a God wrestling with a God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher&#8217;s conversation had
a savour all its own He heard and saw nothing
which did not in some way suggest to him the ways and
love of God He was much in the habit of spiritualising
all allusions of an earthly nature, and what in some
men would have sounded like <i>cant</i> was refined
by his inner spirituality to sanctified quaintness.&#160;
For instance, Mr. Ireland with great difficulty persuaded
Fletcher to sit for his portrait While the artist
was busy, his subject used the time in exhorting all
in the room to spare no pains to get the outlines
and colourings of the image of Jesus impressed upon
their hearts During the barbarous blood-letting
to which his physicians subjected him, he would talk
very tenderly of &#8220;the precious blood-shedding
of the Lamb of God.&#8221;&#160; On being entertained
in the house of a friend he besought the cook to &#8220;stir
up the Divine fire of love within his heart, that
it might burn up all the rubbish therein, and raise
a flame of holy affection&#8221;; while he addressed
the housemaid as follows:&#160; &#8220;I entreat you
to sweep every corner of your heart, that it may be
fit to receive your Heavenly Guest!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev Henry Venn met Fletcher
at the house of Mr. Ireland, where they stayed together
for six weeks Referring to this visit some years
later, Mr. Venn remarked to another clergyman:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, Mr. Fletcher was a luminary&#8212;&#173;<i>a
luminary</i>, did I say?&#160; He was a <i>sun!</i>
I have known all the great men for these fifty years,
but I have known none like him I was intimately
acquainted with him... I never heard him say
a single word which was not proper to be spoken, and
which had not a tendency to minister grace to the
hearers... Never did I hear Mr. Fletcher speak
ill of anyone He would pray for those who walked
disorderly, but he would not publish their faults.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little wonder that both saint and
sinner loved this Christly man!</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XX.</h1>

<h2>By the Shores of Lake Leman</h2>

<p>Unaware of the sickness of her saintly
friend (whom she had not met for fifteen years), Miss
Bosanquet was one day extremely startled to be asked,
&#8220;Do you know that Mr. Fletcher is dying?&#8221;&#160;
She at once began to entreat the  Lord for him, and
while upon her knees received the assurance of James
v. 15:&#160; &#8220;The  prayer of faith shall save
the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at that time the Methodist Conference
was held in Bristol, and Fletcher, who had returned
to the ceaseless care of Mr. Ireland near by, was
one day assisted by him into the assembly A letter
written by one who was present gives an interesting
picture of the scene:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole assembly stood up
as if moved by an electric shock Mr. Wesley
rose, <i>ex cathedr&#226;</i>, and advanced a few paces
to receive his highly-respected friend and reverend
brother, whose visage seemed strongly to bode that
he stood on the verge of the grave, while his eyes,
sparkling with seraphic love, indicated that he dwelt
in the suburbs of Heaven... He addressed the
Conference, on their work and his own views, in a
strain of holy and pathetic eloquence, which no language
of mine can adequately express The influence
of his spirit and pathos seemed to bear down all before
it....He had scarcely pronounced a dozen sentences
before a hundred preachers, to speak in round numbers,
were immersed in tears... Mr. Wesley, in order
to relieve his languid friend from the fatigue and
injury which might arise from a too long and arduous
exertion of the lungs through much speaking, abruptly
kneeled down at his side, the whole congress of preachers
doing the same, while, in a concise and energetic manner,
he prayed for Mr. Fletcher&#8217;s restoration to health,
and a longer exercise of his ministerial labours.&#160;
Mr. Wesley closed his prayer with the following prophetic
promise, pronounced in his peculiar manner, and with
a confidence and emphasis which seemed to thrill through
every heart&#8212;&#173;&#8217;<i>he shall not</i>
<i>die</i>, <i>but live</i>, <i>and declare</i>
<i>the works of the lord</i>?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This prophecy was afterwards blessedly fulfilled.</p>

<p>Madeley yearned for its now beloved
Vicar, and thinking that all would be well if he were
only once more in their midst, one of his parishioners
brought a horse, designing to walk by him all the way
from Bristol to Madeley Two or three others came
and entreated him to travel home in a post-chaise,
but his physicians forbade his return to the scene
of his old labours, and his parishioners, perforce,
returned disappointed.</p>

<p>Miss Bosanquet thought to help the
cure she now expected, and sent a favourite remedy
of her own, which Fletcher acknowledged in a long
letter, but did not try.</p>

<p>Before the year (1777) was spent,
Fletcher had so far recovered his strength as to be
able to travel, and, accompanied by Mr. Ireland, two
of his daughters, and other friends, started for Switzerland,
that once more Fletcher might breathe his native air.</p>

<p>A continental journey by post-chaise
in December was not unlikely to prove trying, but
though the axle-tree broke, and they were left on
the side of a snow-covered hill with nine miles to
walk in the piercing cold of a north wind, Mr. Fletcher
bore the fatigue and cold as well as any of the party.&#160;
By the end of February he was able to ride fifty-five
miles in a day A couple of months later he was
welcomed to his father&#8217;s house at Nyon once more,
where the sweet, pure air, much riding and plenty
of goats&#8217; milk conduced to the healing process
at work within him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a fine shady wood near
the lake,&#8221; he wrote to a friend, &#8220;where
I can ride in the cool all the day, and enjoy the singing
of a multitude of birds.&#8221;&#160; Of the way in
which he spent his time he says, &#8220;I pray, have
patience, rejoice, and write when I can; I saw wood
in the house when I cannot go out; and eat grapes,
of which I have always a basket by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met some children in my wood
gathering strawberries,&#8221; runs a letter to Mr.
Ireland, who had not accompanied him to Nyon; &#8220;I
spoke to them about our <i>common</i> Father.&#160;
We felt a touch of brotherly affection They
said they would sing to their Father, as well as the
birds, and followed me, attempting to make such music
as you know is commonly made in these parts.&#160;
I outrode them, but some of them had the patience
to follow me home, and said they would speak with me.&#160;
The people of the house stopped them, saying I would
not be troubled with children They cried, and
said <i>they were sure I would not say so, for I was
their good brother</i> The next day, when I heard
this, I enquired after them, and invited them to come
and see me, which they have done every day since.&#160;
I make them little hymns, which they sing Some
of them are under sweet drawings... Last Sunday
I met them in the wood; there were a hundred of them,
and as many adults Our first pastor has since
desired me to desist from preaching in the wood...
for fear of giving umbrage; and I have complied, from
a concurrence of circumstances which are not worth
mentioning; I therefore now meet them in my father&#8217;s
yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the following winter Fletcher made
an eighty-mile journey in order to assist his English
medical adviser and friend, William Perronet, to secure
a Swiss inheritance which he had gone to the Continent
to claim Part of the distance had to be performed
on a sledge through &#8220;narrow passes cut through
the snow...frequently on the brinks of precipices&#8221;;
some of it was traversed on foot amid hardship and
danger But neither distances nor difficulties
prevented Fletcher from speaking to all whom he could
find ready to listen of Christ and His boundless love.&#160;
William Perronet declared that he had preached the
Gospel, not only by words and example, but by <i>looks</i>
also, wherever he went.</p>

<p>From the early days of his frugal
feasting upon bread and currants, Fletcher strongly
believed in the plentiful use of fruit as food.&#160;
His grapes were succeeded the following summer by
a black-cherry diet, and for severe rheumatism he
drank a decoction of pine-apple He had also
great faith in exercise, riding in preference to driving,
walking whenever he had strength, and when unable
to go out of doors allowing himself three minutes
of jumping just before dinner This may sound
a curious form of exertion, yet it was recommended
to him by two physicians.</p>

<p>Despite the blessing Fletcher was
to the people around him&#8212;&#173;some of whom pleaded
with him <i>on their knees</i>, with tears, to remain
with them&#8212;&#173;there were many in authority who
took the greatest exception to his &#8220;irregular&#8221;
ways of doing good He was actually &#8220;summoned
before the Seigneur Bailiff, who sharply reprimanded
him for preaching against Sabbath-breaking and stage
plays.&#8221;&#160; He forbade Mr. Fletcher preaching
in any of the churches of his native country.&#160;
Curiously enough, the minister who led this opposition
died suddenly, as he was dressing for church, and
a house was given over to the Vicar&#8217;s use that
he might there exhort the many who came to him for
help and teaching.</p>

<p>While in Switzerland he composed a
French poem called &#8220;La Louange&#8221; (Praise),
which he afterwards enlarged under the title of &#8220;Grace
and Nature,&#8221; dedicating it, by permission, &#8220;To
the Queen of Great Britain.&#8221;&#160; He also wrote
&#8220;The Portrait of St. Paul&#8212;&#173;the true
Model for Christians and Pastors&#8221;; which was
translated and published after his death.</p>

<p>Fletcher arrived in England in April,
1781, preaching at City Road Chapel on his way to
Mr. Ireland&#8217;s house near Bristol, where, because
his friend was ill, he stayed a month, returning to
Madeley in May, after having been absent four and
a-half years.</p>

<p>He found his parish under a cloud,
&#8220;but, alas!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;it is
not the luminous cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire
by night Even the few remaining professors stared
at me the other day when I preached to them on these
words:&#160; &#8217;Ye shall receive the Holy Ghost,
for the promise is unto you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>So sad was he about the spiritual
condition of his parishioners, that he applied to
Wesley for one of his helpers, who was then a master
in Kingswood School; believing truly that two who
were of one mind, both living in communion with the
Holy Ghost, had great hope of bringing to life a dead
parish, even though one were not an authorised curate,
and the other but a sick vicar Fletcher had
learned to look <i>past man</i>&#8212;&#173;to God
and God alone.</p>

<a name="chapter21"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XXI.</h1>

<h2>A Wonderful Wedding</h2>

<p>There existed no &#8220;chance&#8221;
or &#8220;ill-fortune&#8221; for Fletcher Whatever
happened was subject, he believed,  to the over-ruling
providence and direction  of God, and for him there
was no second causes, no human marplots He could
always sing&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Thrice comfortable hope<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That calms my troubled breast;<br>
&#160;&#160;My Father&#8217;s hand prepares the cup,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what He wills is best.</p>

<p>When in answer to a letter of his
to Miss Bosanquet on Christian Perfection there was
sent to him a reply which, by the forgetfulness of
a friend, lay in a drawer for three years undelivered,
he wrote on the morning of its belated arrival:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak, Madam, of <i>a letter
from Bath</i>; I do not recollect, at present, your
having favoured me with one from that place Is
it my lot to be tried or disappointed in this respect?&#160;
Well, the hairs of our heads, and the letters of our
friends, are all numbered; not one of the former falls,
not one of the latter miscarries, without the will
of Him to whose orders we have long since fully and
cheerfully subscribed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss  Bosanquet was at this time in
dire difficulties at Cross Hall Perplexed by
contrary advice, embarrassed by ever-increasing financial
loss, opposed by those who ridiculed her work as a
mission to the mean, &#8220;a call to the care of
cows and horses, sheep and pigs,&#8221; and criticised
even by those to whom she acted as daily benefactor,
her path was by no means an easy one, and eagerly
she looked to the Lord for deliverance, although she
knew not whence it would come.</p>

<p>She suffered more than she could ever
describe through the public work she was called to
do &#8220;None, O my God, but Thyself, knows
what I go through for every public meeting!&#8221;
she exclaimed in her diary Yet, though this
shrinking was combined with exceedingly delicate health,
she never shirked her duty, but went steadily on with
housekeeping, farming, nursing, or public speaking,
just as the Lord gave it to her to do&#8212;&#173;even
consenting to stand upon a horse-block at Huddersfield
to address a crowd whom otherwise she could not have
reached &#8220;Indeed, for none but Thee, my
Lord,&#8221; she cried after that ordeal, &#8220;would
I take up this sore cross!.. O do Thine own
will upon me in all things!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the seventh day of June, a month
after Fletcher&#8217;s return to Madeley, was the
fourteenth anniversary of Miss Bosanquet&#8217;s troubled
sojourn in Yorkshire &#8220;On that day,&#8221;
she relates, &#8220;I took a particular view of my
whole situation, and saw difficulties as mountains
rise around me Faith was hard put to it.&#160;
The promises seemed to stand sure, and I thought the
season was come; yet the waters were deeper than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this time, however, their correspondence
had been renewed, and to Fletcher the thought of Mary
Bosanquet was bringing more than ordinary comfort
and joy.</p>

<p>Finding his health so greatly improved,
he thought he might venture upon a still closer friendship,
and the very day after Miss Bosanquet&#8217;s &#8220;mountains&#8221;
and &#8220;deeper waters&#8221; seemed to hem her in,
a new door opened for her in a proposal of marriage,
which assured her of the regard Fletcher had secretly
treasured for her for twenty-five long years.</p>

<p>In August Mr. Fletcher travelled to
Yorkshire to attend Wesley&#8217;s conference at Leeds,
and Mary Bosanquet&#8217;s diary contains this brief
record:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;We corresponded with openness
and freedom till August 1st, when he came to Cross
Hall and abode there a month; preaching in different
places with much power, and having opened our hearts
to each other, both on temporals and spirituals, we
believed it to be the order of God we should become
one, when He should make our way plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Fletcher could love, and that
ardently, will be seen from a letter written a few
weeks later to the woman of his choice:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Polly! generous, faithful
Polly!&#160; Dost thou indeed permit me to write to
thy friends, and to ask the invaluable gift of thy
hand?&#160; That hand, that is <i>half</i> mine shall
be wholly mine...Polly!&#160; I read thy letter, and
wondered at the expression in it&#8212;&#173;&#8217;<i>If
you think me worth writing for.</i>&#8217; Ah, my
holy, my loving, my lovely, my precious friend, I
think thee worth writing for <i>with my vital blood</i>;
I am only sorry that I had not thee beside me to write
with thy <i>wisdom</i>...</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Difficulties!&#8217;&#160;
If thou hast any I shall gladly share them with thee,
and think myself well repaid with the pleasure of praying
and praising <i>with thee</i> and <i>for thee</i>.&#160;
Therefore, do not talk of <i>struggling through alone</i>.&#160;
I charge thee, by thy faithfulness, let me be <i>alone</i>
as little time as thou canst...</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank thee for that believing
sentence&#8212;&#173;&#8217;But all shall be right.&#8217;&#160;
The worst thy friends can do is to keep thy money,
which I look upon as dung and dross in comparison
of thee Ah, Polly! with the <i>treasure</i>
of <i>thy</i> friendship, and the <i>unsearchable</i>
riches of Christ, how rich thinkest thou I am?&#160;
Count&#8212;&#173;cast up&#8212;&#173;but thou wilt
never make out the amazing sum....</p>

<p>&#8220;I embrace thee in spirit, and
more than mix my soul with thine.&#8221;&#160; (From
&#8220;Wesley&#8217;s Designated Successor.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Of the oneness established between
them John Wesley writes interestingly:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;He (Mr. Fletcher) was upon
all occasions very uncommonly reserved in speaking
of himself, whether in writing or conversation.&#160;
He hardly ever said anything concerning himself, unless
it slipped from him unawares. . .  This defect
was indeed, in some measure, supplied by the entire
intimacy which subsisted between him and Mrs. Fletcher.&#160;
He did not willingly, much less designedly, conceal
anything from her They had no secrets with regard
to each other, but had indeed one house, one purse,
and one heart Before her, it was his invariable
rule to <i>think aloud</i>; always to open the window
in his breast.&#8221;&#160; The story of Mary Bosanquet&#8217;s
deliverance from her Cross Hall embarrassments is
practically a leaf from God&#8217;s Providence Book.</p>

<p>At the end of October the aspect of
her difficulties had in no sense changed, but it was
borne in upon both herself and Mr. Fletcher that they
should act as though God were indeed working for them.&#160;
They agreed to marry in a fortnight, but for the first
week all remained as it was In the beginning
of the second week a gentleman arrived to buy Cross
Hall for &#163;1,620 Three days later another purchased
the farm implements and stock One by one, each
inmate of the house was provided for with the exception
of a poor cripple with great infirmities, whose home
had been with Miss Bosanquet for sixteen years.&#160;
The very night before the wedding even she was provided
for Sally Lawrence, the adopted girl, was to
be taken with them to Madeley.</p>

<p>One little item still remained to
trouble the bride&#8212;&#173;a little payment for
the estate was not to be made immediately, and in order
to provide certain sums to settle the various Cross
Hall inmates in suitable homes, as well as to pay
a few current accounts, &#163;100 was required The
matter was laid in faith before Him to whom belongs
all the silver and the gold, and by the next post
came a bank-note for &#163;100 as a present from Mary Bosanquet&#8217;s
youngest brother!</p>

<p>The diary is brief as usual concerning
the wedding, but it meant very much to both of them
that, without a hindrance remaining, the bride should
be able to write:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, on Monday, the 12th of
November, 1781, in Batley Church, we covenanted in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, &#8216;to bear each other&#8217;s burdens,&#8217;
and to become one for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosby gives us a look-in upon
that memorable marriage day:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the morning of the day several
friends met together They reached Cross Hall
before family prayers Mr. Fletcher . . . read
Rev. xix. 7- 9:&#160; &#8217;Let us be glad, and rejoice,
and give honour to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb
is come,&#8217; <i>etc</i> Mr. Fletcher then spoke
from these verses in such a manner as greatly tended
to spiritualise the solemnities of the day He
said, &#8217;We invite you to our wedding, but the
Holy Ghost invites you to the marriage of the Lamb.&#160;
The bride, the Lamb&#8217;s wife, represents the whole
Church, triumphant and militant united together.&#160;
You may all be the bride, and Jesus will condescend
to be the Bridegroom Make yourselves ready by
being filled with the Spirit.&#8217;&#160; He then
engaged in prayer. . .  They were married in
the face of the congregation; the doors were opened,
and everyone came in that would We then returned
home, and spent a considerable time in singing and
prayer There were nearly twenty of us....</p>

<p>&#8220;From dinner, which was a spiritual
meal as well as a natural one, until tea-time, our
time was chiefly spent in prayer or singing After
singing the covenant hymn Mr. Fletcher went to Mrs.
Fletcher and said to her, &#8217;Well, my dearest
friend, will you unite with me in joining ourselves
in a perpetual covenant to the Lord?&#160; Will you
with me serve Him in His members?&#160; Will you help
me to bring souls to the Blessed Redeemer?&#160; And
in every possible way this day lay yourself under the
strongest ties you can, to help me to glorify my gracious
Lord?&#8217;&#160; She answered, &#8216;May God help
me so to do!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the evening Mr. Valton preached
in the hall from &#8217;What shall I render unto the
Lord for all His benefits?&#160; I will take the cup
of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.&#8217;&#160;
His words did not fall to the ground; many were greatly
refreshed After the preaching there was a sweet
contest among us; everyone thought, &#8217;I, in particular,
owe the greatest debt of praise&#8217;; at length
we agreed to sing&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="center">&#8220;I&#8217;ll praise my Maker
while I&#8217;ve breath,<br>
And when my voice is lost in death<br>
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;<br>
My days of praise shall ne&#8217;er be past,<br>
While life, and thought, and being last,<br>
Or immortality endures!&#8221;</p>

<a name="chapter22"></a>
<h1>CHAPTER XXII.</h1>

<h2>Life at Madeley</h2>

<p>When a post-chaise drove up to Cross
Hall on January and, the crack of the whip made sweet
music in the ears of Mrs. Fletcher, for behind those
horses she was to make her bridal journey to Madeley,
where they were to take up their work together in
the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>Cries the praiseful diary:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I find language to
express the goodness of the Lord!&#160; I know no want
but that of more grace I have a husband in everything
suited to me He bears with all my faults and
failings in a manner that continually reminds me of
the text, &#8217;Love your wives as Christ loved the
church.&#8217;&#160; His constant endeavour is to make
me happy; his strongest desire is for my spiritual
growth He is, in every sense of the word, the
man my highest reason chooses to obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher himself had greatly changed
his opinion since the indictment of his &#8220;Reasons
for and against Matrimony.&#8221;&#160; To a friend
he wrote his new sentiments thus:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;God declared it was not good
that man, a social being, should live alone, and therefore
He gave him a helpmeet for him For the same
reason our Lord sent forth His disciples, two and two.&#160;
Had I searched the three kingdoms I could not have
found one brother willing to share gratis my weal,
woe, and labours, and complaisant enough to unite his
fortunes to mine; but God has found me a partner, <i>a
sister</i>, <i>a wife</i>, to use St. Paul&#8217;s
language, who is not afraid to face with me the colliers
and bargemen of my parish, until death part us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buried together in our country
village, we shall help one another to trim our lamps,
and wait for the coming of the Heavenly Bridegroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher&#8217;s introduction
to her husband&#8217;s parishioners was sufficiently
homely and simple The Madeley kitchen was full
of those who had come from a distance, and who were
accustomed to take refreshments there between the
two services He led her forward into their midst,
adding to his introduction the words, &#8220;I have
not married this wife for myself only, but for your
sakes also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a few weeks later they were honoured
by a visit from John Wesley himself, who, friend of
method as he was, felt anxious that they should lay
down an exactly regular way of ordering their time,
even as Mary Bosanquet had done for her larger household
in the past.</p>

<p>Whether they complied with the suggestion
or not is unrecorded, but Mrs. Fletcher makes beautiful
mention of interruptions to her ordinary routine,
caused by unexpected visitors:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have this day been engaged
in company, and sweetly met the order of God therein.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blessed secret of peace!</p>

<p>God had so united this saintly man
and woman in love and grace that they had abundant
cause to write of each other as we find them doing.&#160;
Once more to the diary:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;May 30th, 1782... I have
the kindest and tenderest of husbands; of so spiritual
a man, and so spiritual a union, I had no adequate
conception.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Charles Wesley Fletcher writes in his turn :-</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for your hint about
exemplifying the love of Christ and His Church.&#160;
I hope we do... My wife is far better to me than
the Church to Christ, so that if the parallel fails,
it will be on my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between November, 1782, and January,
1783, peace was made by Great Britain with America,
France, and Spain Fletcher made this the occasion
of another poem, written in French, entitled, &#8220;An
Essay upon the Peace of 1783 Dedicated to the
Archbishop of Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five months after their marriage Mr.
and Mrs. Fletcher were invited to visit the Methodists
of Dublin The Vicar had been absent so long from
his people that he found further absence just then
impossible Sixteen months later, however, Dr.
Coke came from Dublin and renewed the invitation,
which they accepted.</p>

<p>They set forth upon their five-day
journey, attended by the faithful Sally Lawrence,
Mr. Fletcher preaching unannounced at Shrewsbury and
Llangollen by the way They spent seven weeks
in Dublin, and from accounts written by others, the
preaching of the Vicar and the faithful class-leading
and personal dealing of his wife were blessed in a
remarkable manner A great revival of pure religion
followed; as an evidence of which the membership of
the Methodist Society in that city was permanently
raised from five hundred to one thousand, and a great
hunger to know God and to like Him was awakened in
the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>One church, indeed, opened its doors
to him, but when it was known that he was preaching
also in Methodist meeting-houses he was given to understand
how unwelcome he would be in any of the pulpits of
his clerical brethren The French Church alone
said, &#8220;Come!&#8221; and many flocked there who
could understand no word of what he said When
asked why they went when this was the case, they replied,
&#8220;We went to look at him, for heaven seemed to
beam from his countenance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grateful Methodists thought it
only fair to refund the travelling expenses of the
Vicar and his wife, handing him a purse of twenty-five
guineas for that purpose At first he refused
it, but being greatly pressed, he thanked them very
heartily, and gracefully handed it over to the Society
fund for the sick poor, which he had heard was in a
very needy condition.</p>

<p>Life at Madeley was very full.&#160;
Fletcher regularly visited the eighteen public-houses
of his parish, some of them every Sunday, in addition
to his other work, and, as a result of his labours
and observations, he wrote a pamphlet entitled &#8220;Three
National Grievances,&#8221; in which he dealt largely
with drunkenness and smuggling Taxation was the
third &#8220;grievance,&#8221; wholly influenced in
Fletcher&#8217;s mind by the other two The pamphlet
was sent to every Member of Parliament, being intended
to show them the necessity for Social Reform.</p>

<p>In the wonderful way of quietly busy
men, Fletcher made time to teach in his Madeley School
every day, visiting another as often as occasion permitted,
which he had established in Madeley Wood He also
founded Sunday Schools, and quickly gathered into
them three hundred children, whom he further dealt
with in special children&#8217;s meetings, which were
to him a great delight He had a unique fashion
of teaching; quick to avail himself of every passing
incident as illustration; he never failed to keep
their attention or to engage their affection&#8212;&#173;the
latter being accomplished without any effort upon his
part Until the Thursday before his death, Fletcher
kept up these meetings, and he left behind him an
unfinished catechism designed for the use of the little
ones he so much loved.</p>

<p>Much of the Vicar&#8217;s time was
occupied in visiting the sick He would show
himself intensely grieved if he were not at once apprised
of any illness, and as he preached so much on the
far outskirts of his parish&#8212;&#173;ten, twelve,
and sixteen miles distant&#8212;&#173;the calls were
many Whenever they came he was ready On
the bitterest winter&#8217;s night he would give his
unfailing answer through the window to any messenger,
&#8220;<i>I will be with you immediately</i>&#8221;;
and through storm or frost he set off at once to give
the comfort of his presence and the power of his prayers.</p>

<p>With supreme disregard of personal
need, Fletcher was never happier than when he had
given away every penny in the house He religiously
avoided debt, paying ready money for all he had, but
when due claims were met he loved to pillage the household
resources for the benefit of his sick poor Whether
<i>he</i> had any dinner mattered little, but delight
seized hold upon him when his helpmate was discovered
in the preparation of delicacies for his parish invalids.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher would often take some
article to his wardrobe and find the drawers almost
swept clear of linen Others, he thought, had
needed the garments more than he.</p>

<p>A poor widow called one day to pour
out a story of difficulties with which she found herself
burdened Money there was none at the moment,
but the Vicar was not to be cheated out of this new
chance of helping another Striding into the
kitchen, he laid hands upon the pewter dishes, of
whose polish Sally Lawrence was so proud, and handed
them to the widow with the remark that &#8220;a wooden
trencher served better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Day by day, indeed, John Fletcher
lost himself in the needs and spirit of his Master,
finding in his increasingly clear view of God, his
ever more intimate fellowship with Christ, abiding
treasure and keen delight which were beyond even his
power of felicitous expression It was in keeping
with his hourly experience that he exclaimed in a
letter to Lady Mary Fitzgerald :&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are we, my lady, that we
should not be swallowed up by the holy, loving, living
Spirit, who fills Heaven and earth?&#160; Whether we
consider it or not, there He is, a true, holy, loving,
merciful God Assent to it, my lady, believe
it, rejoice in it Let Him be God, <i>all in
all;</i> your God in Christ Jesus What an ocean
of love to swim in&#8212;&#173; to dive into!&#8221;</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIII.</h1>

<h2>&#8220;God Is Love!&#8221;</h2>

<p>In spite of its beautiful situation,
Madeley was wont at times to be swept by a malignant
fever, which carried away many of its victims to the
grave Shortly before the visit of Mr. and Mrs.
Fletcher to Dublin, such a visitation had occurred,
the faithful Sally being attacked by it, and nursed
to convalescence by mistress and friend.</p>

<p>Two years later it became Sally&#8217;s
turn to play the part of nurse, for Mrs. Fletcher,
who had visited two parishioners who were dying of
the pestilence, was herself stricken.</p>

<p>It was a terrible time of testing
for her devoted husband In anguish of mind,
but with true surrender of his will to God, he yielded
his treasure upon an altar of sacrifice akin to that
of Abraham&#8217;s building; but in answer to his
devotion and prayer he received her  again as alive
from the dead.</p>

<p>With a peculiarly solemn joy he welcomed
his wife back to his side to share the work they so
truly loved, but anxious lest he should place too
much reliance upon the precious things God had given
him here, he would call to her several times in a
day to drop every duty for a few moments that together
they might enjoy communion with God Says Mrs.
Fletcher:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;We spent much time in prayer
for the fulness of the Spirit, and were led to an
act of <i>abandonment</i> (as we called it) of our
whole selves into the hands of God, to do or to suffer
whatever was pleasing to Him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="center">*       *       *       *  
    *</p>

<p>Only a fortnight after his wife&#8217;s
recovery Fletcher was out visiting his people from
three in the afternoon until nine at night, and, August
though it was, he returned with a chill.</p>

<p>The following Sunday he almost fainted
while reading prayers in the church His wife
pressed up to the desk with a friend or two, and begged
him to leave the service to another He gently
refused; windows were opened, some flowers brought
to refresh him with their sweet scent, and he was
able to mount the steps of the pulpit, where he preached
with power from &#8220;<i>How excellent is Thy lovingkindness,
O God! therefore the children of men put their trust
under the shadow of Thy wings</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The communion service which succeeded
was a very lengthy one, but he administered to those
who came until nearly two o&#8217;clock, breaking the
silence with many verses of hymns and exhortations.</p>

<p>When the long service was over, Mrs.
Fletcher led him straight to bed, but the exertion
had been too much; he fainted, and the two following
days lay upon a couch and slept much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher, very simply but touchingly,
tells the story of those few last days:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Wednesday, August 10th,
he told me he had received such a manifestation of
the full meaning of the words, &#8216;<i>God is love</i>,&#8217;
that he could not express it &#8216;It <i>fills
me</i>,&#8217; he said, &#8217;it <i>fills</i> me
every moment O Polly! my dear Polly! <i>God is
love</i>!&#160; Shout!&#160; Shout aloud!&#160; Oh! it
so fills me that I want a gust of praise to go to
the ends of the earth But it seems as if I could
not speak much longer Let us fix upon a sign
between ourselves&#8217; (tapping me twice with his
finger) &#8217;By this I mean that <i>God is
love, and we will draw each other into God Observe!
by this we will draw each other into God.</i>&#8217;
Sally coming in, he cried, &#8217;O Sally! <i>God is
love!</i> Shout, both of you!&#160; I want to hear you
shout His praise!&#8217;&#160; All this time his medical
attendant hoped he was in no danger He knew
his disease to be the fever; but as he had no bad headache,
slept much without the least delirium, and had an
almost regular pulse, the symptoms were thought to
be favourable.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Thursday, August 11th, his
speech began to fail, but to his friendly doctor he
would not be silent while he had any power to speak,
often saying, &#8217;O Sir, you take much thought for
my body; give me leave to take thought for your soul.&#8217;&#160;
When I could scarcely understand anything he said,
I spoke the words, &#8216;<i>God is love!</i>&#8217;
Instantly he caught them, and broke out in a rapture,
&#8217;God is <i>love</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>love!</i>
O for the gust of praise I want to sound.&#8217;&#160;
Here his voice again failed If I named his sufferings
he would smile, and make the sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Friday, August 12th, finding
his body covered with spots, I so far understood them
as to feel a sword pierce through my soul As
I knelt by his bed, with my hand in his, entreating
the Lord to be with us in this tremendous hour, he
strove to say many things, but could not At
length, pressing my hand, and often repeating the sign,
he breathed out &#8216;Head of the Church, be head
to my wife!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher then repeated two lines
in which he had always found great comfort:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Jesu&#8217;s blood, through earth and
skies,<br>
&#160;&#160;Mercy, free, boundless mercy, cries.</p>

<p>With much difficulty he responded :&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Mercy&#8217;s full power I soon shall
prove,<br>
&#160;&#160;Loved with an everlasting love.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Jesus is very present with
thee lift thy right hand,&#8221; said his wife, as
she bent over him He raised it Waiting
a moment or two she said, &#8220;If the prospect of
glory opens before thee, repeat the sign.&#8221;&#160;
Twice he lifted that feeble right hand in testimony,
then fell into <i>coma</i>, lying with his eyes open
and fixed.</p>

<p>While this was taking place in the
Vicarage the church close by was the scene of many
tears Fletcher&#8217;s people gathered there
from time to time to pour out their supplications
to God that He would spare their beloved pastor; but
none could find it in his heart to lead a service,
or raise a hymn.</p>

<p>In the cottages whole families sat
waiting for news, while messengers, who went to and
from the Vicarage, were waylaid on every side for
tidings of joy or sorrow.</p>

<p>Numbers of poor villagers were wont
to come from a distance every Sunday, being entertained
in their Vicar&#8217;s kitchen between the services.&#160;
These lingered about the house in distress, unable
to persuade themselves to seek their distant homes
while one so dear to them lay probably dying.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only <i>look</i>
at him once more!&#8221; they whispered pleadingly.</p>

<p>Accordingly the door of the sick room
was flung wide, the curtains drawn back from the bed,
and this infinitely pathetic procession of peasants
crept softly past the open door, each one pausing for
a long look of love upon him whom they revered as
spiritual father and saint.</p>

<p>For the first time in their experience
there was no kindling light in his eye, no gleam of
welcome from the lips which had so often parted in
smiles and blessing His spirit hovered on the
borders of a land beyond their reach.</p>

<p>That Sabbath Day had scarcely spent
itself when from earthly sleep Jean Guillaume De La
Fl&#233;ch&#232;re entered into eternal waking, so one in spirit
with his Lord that the change could have been no more
surprising than to Enoch of old.</p>

<p>To the woman who knelt at his bedside
until that last dread moment, the parting was no ordinary
sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am truly a desolate woman,
who hath no helper but Thee!&#8221; she wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three years nine months and
two days I have possessed my <i>heavenly-minded husband</i>;
but now the sun of my earthly joy is <i>set for ever!</i>
and my soul is filled with an anguish which only finds
its consolation in a total abandonment and resignation
to the will of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;That awful night, when I had
hung over my dear husband for many hours, expecting
every breath to be his last, and during which time
he could hot speak to, nor take any notice of me,
a flood of unspeakable sorrow overspread my heart,
and quite overwhelmed my spirit... My fatigue
had been great; I was barely recovered from my fever,
and this stroke so tore my nerves that it was an inlet
to much temptation In former parts of my life
I have felt deep sorrow, but such were now my feelings
that no words I am able to think of can convey an adequate
idea thereof.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning, O my God!
what a cup didst Thou put into my hand!&#160; Not only
my beloved husband, but, it appeared to me, my Saviour
also was torn from me!&#160; Clouds and darkness surrounded
both soul and body The sins even of my infancy
came before me, and assaulted me as thick as hail!&#160;
I seemed to have no love, no faith, no light&#8212;&#173;and
yet I could not doubt but I should see the smiling
face of God in glory!...An unshaken belief that Christ
would bring me through all, was my great support;
and it seemed to me that I must have been annihilated
had I been moved from that anchor... All my
religion seemed shrunk into one point, <i>viz</i>.,
a constant cry, &#8217;<i>Thy will be done!&#160; I
will, yes; I will glorify Thee! even in this fire.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at first a matter of some distress
to Mrs. Fletcher that she must leave the home where
they had been so happy together Every other
place alike looked desolate To her relief it
was arranged that she should rent the Vicarage as
long as she wished to do so, working as she chose
among the people of the parish The son of the
patron of the living became the new Vicar, and as
he did not intend to reside at Madeley Mrs. Fletcher
was allowed to recommend the Curate.</p>

<p>Thus, by God&#8217;s grace, was the
labour of the saintly Vicar carried on and confirmed.&#160;
The sweetness of his spirit lingered in fragrant influence
upon the hearts of those whom he had blessed in life,
and though eulogies abound of his remarkable talent,
his gentle courtesy, his unfailing kindness, his beauty
of holiness, none who spoke of him could ever forget
that for himself he had only claimed the position
which almost every morning and evening of his later
life he had thus defined:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;I nothing have, I nothing am;<br>
&#160;&#160;My treasure&#8217;s in the bleeding Lamb,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both now and evermore.</p>

<p>In the desolate stillness of Madeley
Vicarage, where she lived for thirty years after bidding
him farewell, Mrs. Mary Fletcher performed the last
bit of earthly service she might do in the name of
her beloved; she wrote the inscription, which appears
on the following page, for his tombstone in the old
churchyard they had so often crossed side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>October 1st</i>, 1759.</p>

<p>&#8220;DEAR <i>sisters</i>,&#8212;&#173;I
have been putting off writing to you lest the action
of writing should divert my soul from the awful and
delightful worship it is engaged in But I now

Him my soul loveth; to dread Him my soul dreadeth;
to adore Him my soul adoreth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sink with me before the throne

and cry out in tender fear and exquisite trembling,
&#8216;Holy!&#160; Holy!&#160; Holy!&#8217; let us put
our mouths in the dust, and echo back the solemn sound,
&#8216;Holy!&#160; Holy!&#160; Holy!&#8217;&#160; Let
us plunge ourselves in that ocean of purity.&#160;
Let us try to fathom the depths of Divine mercy; and,
convinced of the impossibility of such an attempt,
let us lose ourselves in them Let us be comprehended
by God, if we cannot comprehend Him Let us be
supremely happy in God Let the intenseness of
our happiness border upon misery, because we can make
Him no return Let our head become waters, and
our eyes a fountain of tears&#8212;&#173; <i>tears</i>
of humble repentance, of solemn joy, of silent admiration,
of exalted adoration, of raptured desires, of inflamed
transports, of speechless awe My God and my
all!&#160; Your God and your all!&#160; Our God and
our all!&#160; Praise Him!&#160; With our souls blended
into one by Divine love, let us with one mouth glorify
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; our Father, who
is over all, through all, and in us all &#8220;I
charge you before the Lord Jesus, who giveth life
and more abundant life; I entreat you by all the actings
of faith, the stretchings of hope, the flames of love
you have ever felt, sink to greater depths of self-abasing
repentance; rise to greater heights of Christ-exalting
joy And let Him, who is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that you can ask or think, carry
on, and fulfil in you the work of faith with power;
with that power whereby He subdueth all tilings unto
Himself Be steadfast in hope, immovable in patience
and love, always abounding in the outward and inward
labour of love; and receive the end of your faith,
the salvation of your souls &#8220;I am, dear

<p>&#8220;<i>Madeley</i>, October 12th,  1761.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My dear sir</i>,&#8212;&#173;You
have always the goodness to encourage me, and your
encouragements are not unseasonable; for discouragements
follow one another with very little intermission.&#160;
Those which are of an inward nature are sufficiently
known to you; but some others are peculiar to myself,
especially those I have had for eight days past, during
Madeley wake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing that I could not suppress
these bacchanals, I did all in my power to moderate
their madness; but my endeavours have had little or
no effect You cannot well imagine how much the
animosity of my parishioners is heightened, and with
what boldness it discovers itself against me, because
I preached against drunkenness, shows, and bull-baiting.&#160;
The publicans and maltmen will not forgive me.&#160;
They think that to preach against drunkenness, and
to cut their purse, is the same thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;My church begins not to be
so well filled as it has been, and I account for it
thus:&#160; the curiosity of some of my hearers is satisfied,
and others are offended by the word; the roads are
worse; and if it shall ever please the Lord to pour
His Spirit upon us, the time is not yet come.&#160;
The people, instead of saying, &#8217;Let us go up
to the house of the Lord,&#8217; exclaim, &#8216;Why
should we go and hear a Methodist?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should lose all patience
with my flock if I had not more reason to be satisfied
with them than with myself My own barrenness
furnishes me with excuses for theirs; and I wait the
time when God shall give seed to the sower and increase
to the seed sown In waiting that time, I learn
the meaning of this prayer, &#8216;Thy will be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, your sincere, though unworthy friend,</p>

will soon succeed Away then with all the shadows
of time!&#160; Away from them to the <i>Eternal Substance&#8212;&#173;to
Jesus, the First and the Last, by whom, and for whom,

in your place&#8212;&#173;died under the frowns of
Heaven, that we might die under its smiles Regard
neither unbelief nor doubt Fear neither sin nor
hell Choose neither life nor death All
these are swallowed up in the immensity of Christ,
and are triumphed over in His Cross Fight the
good fight of faith Hold fast your confidence
in the atoning, sanctifying blood of the Lamb of God.&#160;
Confer no more with flesh and blood Go, meet
the Bridegroom Behold He cometh!&#160; Trim your
lamp Quit yourself like a soldier of Jesus.&#160;
I <i>entreat</i> you, as a companion in tribulation;
I <i>charge</i> you, as a minister, go, at every breath
you draw, to Him, who says, &#8217;Him that cometh
unto Me, I will in no wise cast out&#8217;; and &#8217;He
that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live.&#8217;&#160; Joyfully sing the believer&#8217;s

where is thy victory?&#160; Thanks be to God, who giveth

By faith, we live upon the <i>invisible</i>, <i>eternal</i>
God; we believe that <i>in Him</i> we live, move, and
have our being; insensibly we slide from <i>self</i>
into <i>God</i>, from the visible into the invisible,
from the carnal into the spiritual, from time into
eternity Here our spirits are ever young; they
live in and upon the very fountain of strength, sprightliness,
and joy Oh! my dear friend, let us rest more
upon the <i>truth as it is in Jesus</i> Of late,
I have been brought to feed more upon Jesus as <i>the
truth</i> I see more in Him in that character
than I ever did I see Christ <i>the truth</i>
of my life, friends, relations, sense, food, raiment,
light, fire, resting-place All out of Him are

to convey the streams of inward grace.&#8221;</p>

to see it from afar Thank God!&#160; I enjoy
uninterrupted peace in the midst of my trials, which
are, sometimes, not a few Joy also I possess;
but I look for joy of a superior nature I feel
myself, in a good degree, dead to praise and dispraise.&#160;
I hope, at least, that it is so, because I do not
feel that the one lifts me up, or that the other dejects
me I want to see a Pentecost Christian Church;
and, if it is not to be seen at this time upon earth,
I am willing to go and see that glorious wonder in
Heaven How is it with you?&#160; Are you ready

He will be pleased to comfort us by the mutual faith
both of you and me My desire is that Christ

I have any desire to live at any time, it is principally
to be a witness, in word and deed, of the dispensation
of <i>power from on high</i>; and to point out that

me asses&#8217; milk, chicken, <i>etc</i>.; forbids
me riding, and recommends the greatest quietness.&#160;

<p>&#8220;<i>My dear friend</i>,&#8212;&#173;I
keep in my sentry-box till Providence removes me.&#160;
My situation is <i>quite suited</i> to my little strength.&#160;
I may do as much or as little as I please, according
to my weakness; and I have an advantage, which I can
have nowhere else in such a degree&#8212;&#173;my little
field of action is just at my own door, so that if
I happen to overdo myself, I have but to step from
my pulpit to my bed, and from my bed to my grave.&#160;
If I had a body full of vigour, and a purse full of
money, I should like well enough to travel about as
Mr. Wesley does; but as Providence does not call me
to it I readily submit The snail does best in
its shell; were it to aim at galloping, like the racehorse,
it would be ridiculous indeed My wife is quite
of my mind with respect to the call we have to a sedentary
life We are two poor invalids, who between us

<p>&#8220;We shall have tea cheap and

<h1>CHAPTER XXV.</h1>

<h2>Extracts from Fletcher&#8217;s Writings</h2>

<p><b>The Sine of Unbelief</b></p>

<p>&#8220;Unbelief is a sin of so deep
a dye that the devils in hell cannot commit the like.&#160;
Our Saviour never prayed, wept, bled, and died for
devils He never said to them, &#8217;Ye will
not come unto Me, that ye might have life.&#8217;&#160;
They can never be so madly ungrateful as to slight
a Saviour Mercy never wooed their stubborn,
proud hearts as it does ours They have abused
grace, it is true, but they never trampled mercy underfoot.&#160;
This more than diabolical sin is reserved for thee,
careless sinner Now thou hearest Christ compassionately
say in the text, &#8216;Ye will not come unto Me,&#8217;
and thou remainest unmoved; but the time cometh when
Jesus, who meekly entreats, shall sternly curse; when
He who in tender patience says, &#8216;Ye will not
come unto Me,&#8217; shall thunder in righteous vengeance,
&#8217;Depart from Me, ye cursed; depart unto the
second death&#8212;&#173;the fire prepared for the devil
and his angels.&#8217;&#160; In vain wilt thou plead
then as thou dost now, &#8217;Lord, I am no adulterer;
I am no extortioner; I used to eat at Thy table; I
was baptised in Thy name; I was a true churchman;
there are many worse than I am.&#8217;&#160; This will
not admit thee into the Kingdom of Christ His
answer will be, &#8216;I know you not; you never came
to Me for life.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Reading not Preaching</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reading approved sermons is
generally supposed to be preaching the Gospel.&#160;
If this were really so, we need but look out some school-boy
of tolerable capacity; and, after instructing him to
read, with proper emphasis and gesture, the sermons
of Tillotson, Sherlock, or Saurin, we shall have made
him an excellent minister of the Word of God.&#160;
But, if preaching the Gospel is to publish among sinners
that repentance and salvation, which we have experienced
in ourselves, it is evident that experience and sympathy
are more necessary to the due performance of this
work than all the accuracy and elocution that can possibly
be acquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;When this sacred experience
and this generous sympathy began to lose their prevalence
in the Church, their place was gradually supplied by
the trifling substitutes of study and affectation.&#160;
Carnal prudence has now for many ages solicitously
endeavoured to adapt itself to the taste of the wise
and the learned But, while &#8217;<i>the offence
of the cross</i>&#8217; is avoided, neither the wise
nor the ignorant are effectually converted.</p>

<p>&#8220;In consequence of the same
error, the ornaments of theatrical eloquence have
been sought after, with a shameful solicitude.&#160;
And what has been the fruit of so much useless toil?
<i>Preachers</i>, after all, have played their part
with much less applause than <i>comedians</i>; and
their curious auditories are still running from the
pulpit to the stage, for the purpose of hearing fables
repeated with a degree of sensibility, which the messengers
of truth can neither <i>feel</i>, nor <i>feign</i>.&#8221;</p>

down the curse of Heaven, and poured desolation and
ruin upon the most flourishing kingdoms&#8212;&#173;I
mean pride in apparel Even in this place, where
poverty, hard labour, and drudgery would, one should
think, prevent a sin which Christianity cannot tolerate
even in kings&#8217; houses, there are not wanting
foolish virgins, who draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
and betray the levity of their hearts by that of their
dress Yea, some women, who should be mothers
in Israel, and adorn themselves with good works as
holy and godly matrons, openly affect the opposite
character You may see them offer themselves
first to the idol of vanity, and then sacrifice their
children upon the same altar As some sons of
Belial teach their little ones, to curse, before they
can well speak, so these daughters of Jezebel drag
their unhappy offspring, before they can walk, to the
haunts of vanity and pride They complain of evening
lectures, but run to midnight dancings Oh, that
such persons would let the prophet&#8217;s words sink
into their frothy minds, and fasten upon their careless
hearts:&#160; &#8217;Because the daughters of Sion are
haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton
eyes, the Lord will smite with a sore the crown of
their head, and discover their shame:&#160; instead
of well-set hair, there shall be baldness, and burning
instead of beauty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><b>What Is Saving Faith?</b></p>

<p>&#8220;What is <i>saving</i> faith?&#160;
I dare not say that it is &#8217;believing heartily&#8217;
my sins are forgiven me for Christ&#8217;s sake; for,
if I live in sin, that belief is a <i>destructive</i>
conceit, and not <i>saving</i> faith Neither
dare I say, that &#8217;saving faith is <i>only</i>
a sure trust and confidence that Christ loved me,
and gave Himself for me;&#8217; for, if I did, I should
almost damn all mankind for four thousand years.&#160;
Such definitiohs of saving faith are, I fear, too
<i>narrow</i> to be just, and too <i>unguarded</i>
to keep out Solifidianism To avoid such mistakes;
to contradict no Scriptures; to put no black mark
of <i>damnation</i> upon any man, that in any nation
fears God and works righteousness; to leave no room
for Solifidianism, and to present the reader with a
definition of faith adequate to <i>the everlasting
Gospel</i>, I would choose to say, that justifying
or saving faith is <i>believing</i> the saving truth
<i>with the heart unto</i> internal, and (as we have
opportunity) <i>unto</i> external <i>righteousness</i>,
according to our light and dispensation To St.
Paul&#8217;s words (Rom. x. 10), I add the epithets
<i>internal</i> and <i>external</i>, in order to exclude,
according to I John iii. 7, 8, the filthy imputation,
under which fallen believers may, if we credit the
Antinomians, commit internal and external adultery,
mental and bodily murder, without the least reasonable
fear of endangering their faith, their interest in
God&#8217;s favour, and their inadmissible title to
a throne of glory.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>The Eye of Faith</b></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Believing</i> is the gift
of <i>the God of Grace</i>, as <i>breathing</i>, <i>moving</i>,
and <i>eating</i> are the gifts of <i>the God of Nature</i>.&#160;
He gives me lungs and air, that I may breathe; He
gives me life and muscles, that I may move; He bestows
upon me food and a mouth, that I may eat; but He neither
<i>breathes</i>, <i>moves</i>, nor <i>eats</i> for
me Nay, when I think proper, I can accelerate
my breathing, motion, and eating:&#160; and, if I please,
I may <i>fast</i>, <i>lie down</i>, or <i>hang myself</i>,
and, by that means, put an end to my <i>eating</i>,
<i>moving</i>, and <i>breathing</i>. <i>Faith</i>
is the gift of God to believers, <i>as sight</i> is
to you The parent of good freely gives you the
light of the sun, and organs proper to receive it.&#160;
Everything around you bids you use your eyes and see;
nevertheless, you may not only drop your curtains,
but close your eyes also This is exactly the
case with regard to faith Free grace removes,
in part, the total blindness which Adam&#8217;s fall
brought upon us; free grace gently sends us some beams
of truth, which is the light of <i>the sun of righteousness</i>;
it disposes the eye of our understanding to see those
beams; it excites us, in various ways, to welcome
them; it blesses us with many, perhaps with all the
means of faith, such as opportunities to hear, read,
enquire, and power to consider, assent, consent, resolve,
and re-resolve to believe the truth But, after
all, <i>believing</i> is as much our own act as <i>seeing.</i>
We may in general do, suspend, or omit the <i>act</i>
of faith Nay, we may do by the eye of our faith,
what some report Democritus did by his bodily eyes.&#160;
Being tired of seeing the follies of mankind, to rid
himself of that disagreeable sight, he put his eyes
out We may be so averse from <i>the light, which
enlightens every man</i> that <i>comes into the world;</i>
we may so dread it because our works are evil, as
to exemplify, like the Pharisees, such awful declarations
as these:&#160; <i>Their eyes have they closed, lest
they should see:&#160; wherefore God gave them up to
a reprobate mind, and, they were blinded</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>From Animal Man to Spiritual
Man</b></p>

<p>&#8220;What is the state of a soul
that is born again; and in what does regeneration
consist?&#160; In general, we may say, it is that great
change by which man passes from a state of nature
to a state of grace He was an animal man; in
being born again he becomes a spiritual man His
natural birth had made him like to fallen Adam&#8212;&#173;to
the old man, against whom God had pronounced the sentence
of death, seeing it is the wages of sin; but his spiritual
birth makes him like to Jesus Christ&#8212;&#173;to
the new man&#8212;&#173;which is created according to
God in  righteousness and true holiness He was
before born a child of wrath&#8212;&#173; proud, sensual,
and unbelieving, full of the love of the world and
of self-love, a lover of money and of earthly glory
and pleasure, rather than a lover of God; but, by
regeneration, he is become a child and an heir of
God, and a joint heir with Christ The humility,
the purity, the love of Jesus, is shed abroad in his
heart by the Holy Spirit which is given to him, making
him bear the image of the <i>Second Adam</i>.&#160;
He is in Christ a new creature; old things are passed
away, all things are become new All the powers
and faculties of his soul are renovated His
understanding, heretofore covered with darkness, is
illuminated by the experimental knowledge which he
has of God and of His Son Jesus Christ His conscience,
asleep and insensible, awakes and speaks with a fidelity
irreproachable His hard heart is softened and
broken His will, stubborn and perverse, yields,
and becomes conformable to the will of God His
passions, unruly, and earthly, and sensual, submit
to the conduct of grace, and turn of themselves to
objects invisible and heavenly And the members
of his body, servants more or less to iniquity, are
now employed in the service of righteousness unto
holiness.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Tastes that Correspond</b></p>

<p>&#8220;To rejoice in the pleasures
that are at God&#8217;s right hand, it is needful
to have senses and a taste that correspond thereto.&#160;
The swine trample pearls under their feet The
elevated discourse of a philosopher is insupportable
to a stupid mechanic; and an ignorant peasant, introduced
into a circle of men of learning and taste, is disgusted,
sighs after his village, and declares no hour ever
appeared to him so long It would be the same
to a man who is not regenerated, if we could suppose
that God would so far forget His truth as to open
to him the gate of Heaven He would be incapable
of those transports of love which make the happiness
of the glorified saints It would be insupportable
for him now to meditate one hour on the perfections
of God; what then shall He do among the <i>cherubim</i>
and <i>seraphim</i>, and <i>the spirits of just men
made perfect</i>, who draw from thence their ravishing
delights?&#160; He loves the pleasures and comforts
of an animal life; but are these the same with the
exercises of the spiritual life?&#160; His conversations,
his readings, his amusements, as void of edification
as of usefulness, rarely fatigue him; but an hour of
meditation or prayer is insufferable If he be
not born again, not only he cannot be in a state to
rejoice in the pleasures of Paradise, any more than
a deaf man to receive with transport the most exquisite
music; but the ravishing delights of angels would cause
in him an insupportable distaste Yes, he would
banish himself from the presence of God rather than
pass an eternity in prostrating himself before the
throne, and crying day and night, <i>Holy, holy, holy,
is the Lord of hosts, who is, and who was, and who
is to come!</i> We conclude that the gate of Heaven
must be opened upon earth by regeneration, and by
the love of God, or that it will remain shut for ever;
and that a local paradise would be only a sorrowful
prison to a man not regenerated, because, carrying
nothing thither but depraved and earthly appetites
and passions, and finding nothing there but spiritual
and celestial objects, disgust and dissatisfaction
would be the consequence; and, like Satan, his own
mind would be his hell.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Wise Words to the Sinner</b></p>

<p>&#8220;I conjure you by the majesty
of that God before whom angels rejoice with trembling;
by the terror of the Lord, who may speak to you in
thunder, and this instant require your soul of you;
by the tender mercies, the bowels of compassion of
your Heavenly Father, which are moved in your favour,
all ungrateful as you are!&#160; I conjure you by the
incarnation of the Eternal Word, by whom you were created;
by the humiliation, the pains, the temptations, the
tears, the bloody sweat, the agony, the cries of our
great God and Saviour Jesus Christ!&#160; I conjure
you by the bonds, the insults, the scourgings, the
robes of derision, the crown of thorns, the ponderous
cross the nails, the instruments of death which pierced
His torn body; by the arrows of the Almighty, the
poison of which drank up His spirit; by  that mysterious
stroke of Divine wrath, and by those unknown terrors
which forced Him to exclaim, &#8216;My God, My God,
why hast Thou forsaken Me!&#8217;&#160; I conjure you
by the interests of your immortal  soul, and by the
unseen accidents which may precipitate you into eternity;
by the bed of death, upon which you will soon be stretched,
and by the useless sighs which you will then pour
out, if your peace be not made with God!&#160; I conjure
you by the sword of Divine justice, and by the sceptre
of grace; by the sound of the last trumpet, and by
the sudden appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ, with
ten thousand of His holy angels; by that august tribunal,
at which you will  appear with me, and which shall
decide our lot for ever; by the vain despair of hardened
sinners, and by the unknown transports of regenerate
souls!&#160; I conjure you from this instant work out
your salvation with fear and trembling!&#160; Enter
by the door into the sheepfold Sell all to purchase
the pearl of great price Count all things dung
and dross in comparison of the excellency of the knowledge
of Jesus Christ Let Him not go till He blesses
you with that faith which justifies, and that sanctification
without which no man shall see the Lord And,
soon transported from  this vale of tears into the
mansions of the just made perfect, you shall cast your
crown of immortal glory at the feet of Him that sitteth
upon the throne, and before the Lamb who has redeemed
us by His blood:&#160; to whom be the blessing, and
the honour, and the glory, and the power for ever
and ever!&#160; Amen.&#8221;</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, FLETCHER OF MADELEY ***

This file should be named fltch10h.htm or fltch10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, fltch11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, fltch10a.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
