<h1>
Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, called to be an
apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother
Sosthenes,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to the assembly
of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus,
called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Grace to you and peace from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> I always thank my God
concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
 <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> that in everything you
were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> even as the testimony of Christ
was confirmed in you:  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> so
that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord
Jesus Christ;  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> who will
also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> God is faithful,
through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ,
our Lord.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Now I beg you,
<a href="#N1">brothers,</a> through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among
you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> For it has been
reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's
household, that there are contentions among you.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Now I mean this, that each one of
you says, &quot;I follow Paul,&quot; &quot;I follow Apollos,&quot; &quot;I
follow Cephas,&quot; and, &quot;I follow Christ.&quot;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Is Christ divided? Was Paul
crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> I thank God that I baptized none
of you, except Crispus and Gaius,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> so that no one should say that I
had baptized you into my own name.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> (I also baptized the household of
Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)
 <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> For Christ sent me not to
baptize, but to preach the Good News--not in wisdom of words, so that the
cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> For the word of the cross is
foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the
power of God.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> For it is
written,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
<dd>I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Where is the wise?
Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn't God made
foolish the wisdom of this world?  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> For seeing that in the wisdom of
God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good
pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who
believe.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> For Jews ask for
signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,  <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> but we preach Christ crucified; a
stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> but to those who are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> Because the foolishness of God is
wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  <a name="C1V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:26</font></a> For you see your calling,
brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty,
and not many noble;  <a name="C1V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:27</font></a> but
God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those
who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to
shame the things that are strong;  <a name="C1V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:28</font></a> and God chose the lowly things of
the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not,
that he might bring to nothing the things that are:  <a name="C1V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:29</font></a> that no flesh should boast before
God.  <a name="C1V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:30</font></a> But of him, you are
in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and
sanctification, and redemption:  <a name="C1V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:31</font></a> that, according as it is written,
&quot;He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> When I came to you,
brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom,
proclaiming to you the testimony of God.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> For I determined not to know
anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> I was with you in weakness, in
fear, and in much trembling.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> My speech and my preaching were
not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit and of power,  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> that
your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
 <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> We speak wisdom, however,
among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the
rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> But we speak God's wisdom in a
mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before
the worlds for our glory,  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> which none of the rulers of this
world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the
Lord of glory.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> But as it
is written,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear,
<dd>which didn't enter into the heart of man,
<dt>these God has prepared for those who love him.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> But to us, God
revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes,
the deep things of God.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> For who among men knows the
things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so,
no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> But we received, not the spirit
of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the
things that were freely given to us by God.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Which things also we speak, not
in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Now the natural man doesn't
receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and
he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> But he who is spiritual discerns
all things, and he himself is judged by no one.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> &quot;For who has known the mind
of the Lord, that he should instruct him?&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font> But we have Christ's mind.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Brothers, I couldn't
speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> I fed you with milk, not
with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
 <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> for you are still fleshly.
For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't
you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> For when one says, &quot;I follow
Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I follow Apollos,&quot; aren't you fleshly?
 <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Who then is Apollos, and
who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord
gave to him?  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> I planted.
Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> So then neither he who plants is
anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Now he who plants and he who
waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his
own labor.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> For we are
God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> According to the grace of God
which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and
another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
 <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> For no one can lay any
other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
 <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> But if anyone builds on
the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
 <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> each man's work will be
revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and
the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> If any man's work remains which
he built on it, he will receive a reward.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> If any man's work is burned, he
will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.
<p> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Don't you know that
you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> If anyone destroys the temple of
God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.
 <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Let no one deceive
himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him
become a fool, that he may become wise.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is written, &quot;He has taken the wise in
their craftiness.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> And again, &quot;The Lord knows
the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Therefore let no one boast in
men. For all things are yours,  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to
come. All are yours,  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> and
you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> So let a man think of
us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> Here, moreover, it is required of
stewards, that they be found faithful.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> But with me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I don't
judge my own self.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> For I
know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who
judges me is the Lord.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Therefore judge nothing before the
time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things
of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get
his praise from God.
<p> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Now these things,
brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your
sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are
written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> For who makes you different? And
what do you have that you didn't receive? But if you did receive it, why
do you boast as if you had not received it?  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> You are already filled. You have
already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish
that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> For, I think that God has
displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For
we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> We are fools for Christ's sake,
but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have
honor, but we have dishonor.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Even to this present hour we
hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.
 <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> We toil, working with our
own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.
 <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Being defamed, we
entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all,
even until now.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> I don't
write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved
children.  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For though you
have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ
Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> I beg you therefore, be imitators
of me.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Because of this I
have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the
Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach
everywhere in every assembly.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Now some are puffed up, as though
I were not coming to you.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> But I will come to you shortly,
if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are
puffed up, but the power.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> For the Kingdom of God is not in
word, but in power.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> What
do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of
gentleness?
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> It is actually reported
that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as
is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife.
 <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> You are puffed up, and
didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from
among you.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> For I most
certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as
though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> In the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ,  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> are to
deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<p> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Your boasting is not
good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Purge out the old yeast, that you
may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our
Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Therefore let us keep the feast,
not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but
with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> I wrote to you in my letter to
have no company with sexual sinners;  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> yet not at all meaning with the
sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or
with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> But as it is, I wrote to you not
to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner,
or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> For what have I to do with also
judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?
 <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> But those who are
outside, God judges. &quot;Put away the wicked man from among
yourselves.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Dare any of you, having
a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not
before the saints?  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Don't
you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged
by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> Don't you know that we will judge
angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> If then, you have to judge things
pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in
the assembly?  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> I say this
to move you to shame. Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be
able to decide between his brothers?  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> But brother goes to law with
brother, and that before unbelievers!  <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Therefore it is already altogether
a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather
be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> No, but you yourselves do wrong,
and defraud, and that against your brothers.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Or don't you know that the
unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived.
Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male
prostitutes, nor homosexuals,  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of
God.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Such were some of
you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified
in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> &quot;All things are lawful for
me,&quot; but not all things are expedient. &quot;All things are lawful
for me,&quot; but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
 <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> &quot;Foods for the
belly, and the belly for foods,&quot; but God will bring to nothing both
it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord;
and the Lord for the body.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> Now God raised up the Lord, and
will also raise us up by his power.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> Don't you know that your bodies
are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make
them members of a prostitute? May it never be!  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> Or don't you know that he who is
joined to a prostitute is one body? For, &quot;The two,&quot; says he,
&quot;will become one flesh.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N9">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> But he who is joined to the Lord
is one spirit.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> Flee
sexual immorality! &quot;Every sin that a man does is outside the
body,&quot; but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own
body.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> Or don't you know
that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you
have from God? You are not your own,  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> for you were bought with a price.
Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> Now concerning the
things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a
woman.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> But, because of
sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman
have her own husband.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Let
the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also
the wife to her husband.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> The wife doesn't have authority
over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have
authority over his own body, but the wife.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> Don't deprive one another, unless
it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and
prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of
your lack of self-control.
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> But this I say by way
of concession, not of commandment.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Yet I wish that all men were like
me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and
another of that kind.  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> But
I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain
even as I am.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> But if they
don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to
burn.  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> But to the married
I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband
 <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> (but if she departs, let
her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the
husband not leave his wife.
<p> <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> But to the rest I--not
the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content
to live with him, let him not leave her.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> The woman who has an unbelieving
husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her
husband.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> For the
unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but
now they are holy.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> Yet if
the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister
is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> For how do you know,
wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband,
whether you will save your wife?  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Only, as the Lord has distributed
to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all
the assemblies.
<p> <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> Was anyone called
having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been
called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
 <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Let each man stay in that
calling in which he was called.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> Were you called being a
bondservant? Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to
become free, use it.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> For
he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man.
Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> You were bought with a price.
Don't become bondservants of men.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Brothers, let each man, in
whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.
<p> <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Now concerning
virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as
one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> I think that it is good
therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a
man to be as he is.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> Are
you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife?
Don't seek a wife.  <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> But if
you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.
 <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> But I say this, brothers:
the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as
though they had none;  <a name="C7V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:30</font></a> and
those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as
though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't
possess;  <a name="C7V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:31</font></a> and those who
use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world
passes away.  <a name="C7V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:32</font></a> But I desire
to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for
the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;  <a name="C7V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:33</font></a> but he who is married is
concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
 <a name="C7V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:34</font></a> There is also a
difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about
the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.
But she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may
please her husband.  <a name="C7V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:35</font></a> This
I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which
is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.
 <a name="C7V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:36</font></a> But if any man thinks
that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the
flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He
doesn't sin. Let them marry.  <a name="C7V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:37</font></a> But he who stands steadfast in
his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep
his own virgin, does well.  <a name="C7V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:38</font></a> So then both he who gives his own
virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does
better.  <a name="C7V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:39</font></a> A wife is bound
by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she
is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.  <a name="C7V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:40</font></a> But she is happier if she stays
as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Now concerning things
sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs
up, but love builds up.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> But if anyone thinks that he knows
anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> But if anyone loves God, the same
is known by him.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Therefore
concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol
is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> For though there are things that
are called &quot;gods,&quot; whether in the heavens or on earth; as there
are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords;&quot;  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> yet to us there is one God, the
Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus
Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> However, that knowledge isn't in
all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a
thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
 <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> But food will not commend
us to God. For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat,
are we the better.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> But be
careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling
block to the weak.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> For if
a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his
conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to
idols?  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> And through your
knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ
died.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> Thus, sinning
against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you
sin against Christ.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Therefore, if food causes my
brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my
brother to stumble.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> Am I not free? Am I not
an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren't you my work in
the Lord?  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> If to others I
am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my
apostleship in the Lord.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> My defense to those who examine me
is this.  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Have we no right
to eat and to drink?  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> Have
we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of
the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> Or have only Barnabas and I no
right to not work?  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> What
soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't
eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's
milk?  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> Do I speak these
things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same
thing?  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> For it is written
in the law of Moses, &quot;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out
the grain.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N10">*</a></sup></font> Is it for the oxen that God cares,  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> or does he say it assuredly for
our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to
plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.
 <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> If we sowed to you
spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?
 <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> If others partake of this
right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right,
but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of
Christ.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> Don't you know
that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the
temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?
 <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Even so the Lord ordained
that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.
 <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> But I have used none of
these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my
case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting
void.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> For if I preach the
Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but
woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> For if I do this of my own will,
I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted
to me.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> What then is my
reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of
Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.
 <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> For though I was free
from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the
more.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> To the Jews I
became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law,
as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> to those who are without law, as
without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward
Christ), that I might win those who are without law.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> To the weak I became as weak,
that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I
may by all means save some.  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Now I do this for the sake of the
Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> Don't you know that those who run
in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may
win.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Every man who
strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it
to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> I therefore run like that, as not
uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> but I beat my body and bring it
into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I
myself should be rejected.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now I would not have
you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all
passed through the sea;  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> and were all baptized into Moses
in the cloud and in the sea;  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> and all ate the same spiritual
food;  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> and all drank the
same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed
them, and the rock was Christ.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> However with most of them, God
was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Now these things were our
examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also
lusted.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> Neither be
idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, &quot;The people sat
down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Neither let us commit sexual
immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three
thousand fell.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Neither
let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the
serpents.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> Neither
grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.
 <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Now all these things
happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our
admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Therefore let him who thinks he
stands be careful that he doesn't fall.
<p> <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> No temptation has
taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not
allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the
temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
 <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Therefore, my beloved,
flee from idolatry.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> I
speak as to wise men. Judge what I say.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> The cup of blessing which we
bless, isn't it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we
break, isn't it a sharing of the body of Christ?  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> Because there is one loaf of
bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf
of bread.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Consider
Israel according to the flesh. Don't those who eat the sacrifices
participate in the altar?
<p> <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> What am I saying
then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is
anything?  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> But I say that
the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not
to God, and I don't desire that you would have fellowship with demons.
 <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> You can't both drink the
cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table
of the Lord, and of the table of demons.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> Or do we provoke the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than he?  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> &quot;All things are lawful for
me,&quot; but not all things are profitable. &quot;All things are lawful
for me,&quot; but not all things build up.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> Let no one seek his own, but
each one his neighbor's good.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Whatever is sold in the butcher
shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> for &quot;the earth is the
Lord's, and its fullness.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> But if one of those who don't
believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is
set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> But if anyone says to you,
&quot;This was offered to idols,&quot; don't eat it for the sake of the
one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For &quot;the earth is
the Lord's, and all its fullness.&quot;  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Conscience, I say, not your own,
but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another
conscience?  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> If I partake
with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?
 <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> Whether therefore you
eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> Give no occasions for stumbling,
either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> even as I also please all men in
all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that
they may be saved.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> Be imitators of me,
even as I also am of Christ.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Now I praise you, brothers, that
you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I
delivered them to you.  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> But I would have you know that
the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and
the head of Christ is God.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered, dishonors his head.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> But every woman praying or
prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and
the same thing as if she were shaved.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> For if a woman is not covered,
let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or
shaved, let her be covered.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> For a man indeed ought not to
have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the
woman is the glory of the man.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> For man is not from woman, but
woman from man;  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> for
neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> For this cause the woman ought
to have authority on her head, because of the angels.
<p> <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Nevertheless, neither
is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman,
in the Lord.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> For as
woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things
are from God.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> Judge for
yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> Doesn't even nature itself teach
you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> But if a woman has long hair, it
is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> But if any man seems to be
contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.
<p> <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> But in giving you
this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the
better but for the worse.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> For first of all, when you come
together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I
partly believe it.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> For
there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be
revealed among you.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> When
therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper
that you eat.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> For in
your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and
another is drunken.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> What, don't you have houses to
eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to
shame who don't have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I
don't praise you.
<p> <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> For I received from
the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the
night in which he was betrayed took bread.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> When he had given thanks, he
broke it, and said, &quot;Take, eat. This is my body,
which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.&quot;  <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> In the same way he also took the
cup, after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new
covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of
me.&quot;  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> For as
often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's
death until he comes.  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> Therefore whoever eats this
bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be
guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.  <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> But let a man examine himself,
and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> For he who eats and drinks in an
unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern
the Lord's body.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> For
this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
 <a name="C11V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:31</font></a> For if we discerned
ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.  <a name="C11V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:32</font></a> But when we are judged, we are
punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.  <a name="C11V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:33</font></a> Therefore, my brothers, when you
come together to eat, wait one for another.  <a name="C11V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:34</font></a> But if anyone is hungry, let him
eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will
set in order whenever I come.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now concerning
spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> You know that when you were <a
href="#N13">heathen</a>, you were led away to those mute idols, however
you might be led.  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> Therefore I make known to you
that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, &quot;Jesus is accursed.&quot;
No one can say, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; but by the Holy Spirit.  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> Now there are various kinds of
gifts, but the same Spirit.
<p> <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> There are various
kinds of service, and the same Lord.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> There are various kinds of
workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> But to each one is given the
manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> For to one is given through the
Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according
to the same Spirit;  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> to
another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by
the same Spirit;  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> and to
another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another
discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to
another the interpretation of languages.  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> But the one and the same Spirit
works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.
<p> <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> For as the body is
one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many,
are one body; so also is Christ.  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> For in one Spirit we were all
baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and
were all given to drink into one Spirit.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> For the body is not one member,
but many.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> If the foot
would say, &quot;Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body,&quot;
it is not therefore not part of the body.  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> If the ear would say,
&quot;Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body,&quot; it's not
therefore not part of the body.  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> If the whole body were an eye,
where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the
smelling be?  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> But now God
has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.
 <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> If they were all one
member, where would the body be?  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> But now they are many members,
but one body.  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> The eye
can't tell the hand, &quot;I have no need for you,&quot; or again the head
to the feet, &quot;I have no need for you.&quot;  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> No, much rather, those members
of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> Those parts of the body which we
think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and
our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> whereas our presentable parts
have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more
abundant honor to the inferior part,  <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> that there should be no division
in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one
another.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> When one member
suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored,
all the members rejoice with it.
<p> <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> Now you are the body
of Christ, and members individually.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> God has set some in the
assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle
workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of
languages.  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> Are all
apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?
 <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> Do all have gifts of
healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> But earnestly desire the best
gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> If I speak with the
languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become
sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> If I have the gift of prophecy,
and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as
to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> If I dole out all my goods to
feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it
profits me nothing.
<p> <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> Love is patient and is
kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> doesn't behave itself
inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no
account of evil;  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> doesn't
rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> bears all things, believes all
things, hopes all things, endures all things.  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> Love never fails. But where there
are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various
languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away
with.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> For we know in
part, and we prophesy in part;  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> but when that which is complete
has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> When I was a child, I spoke as a
child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a
man, I have put away childish things.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> For now we see in a mirror,
dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know
fully, even as I was also fully known.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> But now faith, hope, and love
remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> Follow after love, and
earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.
 <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> For he who speaks in
another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands;
but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> But he who prophesies speaks to
men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> He who speaks in another language
edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> Now I desire to have you all
speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is
greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he
interprets, that the assembly may be built up.
<p> <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> But now, <a
href="#N14">brothers,</a> if I come to you speaking with other languages,
what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of
revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Even things without life, giving
a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the
sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> For if the trumpet gave an
uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> So also you, unless you uttered
by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is
spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> There are, it may be, so many
kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> If then I don't know the meaning
of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks
would be a foreigner to me.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> So also you, since you are
zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up
of the assembly.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Therefore let him who speaks in
another language pray that he may interpret.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> For if I pray in another
language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
<p> <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> What is it then? I
will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I
will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
 <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> Otherwise if you bless
with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the
&quot;Amen&quot; at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you
say?  <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> For you most
certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.  <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> I thank my God, I speak with
other languages more than you all.  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> However in the assembly I would
rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct
others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
<p> <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> Brothers, don't be
children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.
 <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> In the law it is
written, &quot;By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I
will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the
Lord.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Therefore other languages are
for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but
prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who
believe.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> If therefore
the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other
languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say
that you are crazy?  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> But
if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is
reproved by all, and he is judged by all.  <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> And thus the secrets of his
heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God,
declaring that God is among you indeed.
<p> <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> What is it then,
brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a
teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation.
Let all things be done to build each other up.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> If any man speaks in another
language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one
interpret.  <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> But if there
is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak
to himself, and to God.  <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> Let the prophets speak, two or
three, and let the others discern.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> But if a revelation is made to
another sitting by, let the first keep silent.  <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> For you all can prophesy one by
one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.  <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> The spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets,  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> for God is not a God of
confusion, but of peace.
<p>As in all the assemblies of the saints,  <a name="C14V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:34</font></a> let your wives keep silent in
the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let
them be in subjection, as the law also says.  <a name="C14V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:35</font></a> If they desire to learn
anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for
a woman to chatter in the assembly.  <a name="C14V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:36</font></a> What? Was it from you that the
word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?  <a name="C14V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:37</font></a> If any man thinks himself to be
a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to
you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.  <a name="C14V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:38</font></a> But if anyone is ignorant, let
him be ignorant.  <a name="C14V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:39</font></a> Therefore, brothers, desire
earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.
 <a name="C14V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:40</font></a> Let all things be done
decently and in order.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Now I declare to you,
brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received,
in which you also stand,  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> by which also you are saved, if
you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in
vain.  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> For I delivered to
you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures,  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> that he was buried, that he was
raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> and that he appeared to Cephas,
then to the twelve.  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> Then
he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain
until now, but some have also fallen asleep.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> Then he appeared to James, then
to all the apostles,  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> and
last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me
also.  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> For I am the least
of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the assembly of God.  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> But by the grace of God I am
what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked
more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
 <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> Whether then it is I or
they, so we preach, and so you believed.
<p> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> Now if Christ is
preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say
that there is no resurrection of the dead?  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> But if there is no resurrection
of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> If Christ has not been raised,
then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.  <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> Yes, we are found false
witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ,
whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.  <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> For if the dead aren't raised,
neither has Christ been raised.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> If Christ has not been raised,
your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> Then they also who are fallen
asleep in Christ have perished.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> If we have only hoped in Christ
in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
<p> <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> But now Christ has
been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are
asleep.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> For since death
came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> For as in Adam all die, so also
in Christ all will be made alive.  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> But each in his own order:
Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.
 <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> Then the end comes, when
he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have
abolished all rule and all authority and power.  <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> For he must reign until he has
put all his enemies under his feet.  <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> The last enemy that will be
abolished is death.  <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> For,
&quot;He put all things in subjection under his feet.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N16">*</a></sup></font> But when he
says, &quot;All things are put in subjection,&quot; it is evident that he
is excepted who subjected all things to him.  <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> When all things have been
subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who
subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.  <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> Or else what will they do who
are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are
they baptized for the dead?  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> Why do we also stand in jeopardy
every hour?  <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> I affirm, by
the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
 <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> If I fought with animals
at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not
raised, then &quot;let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> Don't be deceived! &quot;Evil
companionships corrupt good morals.&quot;  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> Wake up righteously, and don't
sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.  <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> But someone will say, &quot;How
are the dead raised?&quot; and, &quot;With what kind of body do they
come?&quot;  <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> You foolish
one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> That which you sow, you don't
sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some
other kind.  <a name="C15V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:38</font></a> But God
gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its
own.  <a name="C15V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:39</font></a> All flesh is not
the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals,
another of fish, and another of birds.  <a name="C15V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:40</font></a> There are also celestial bodies,
and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that
of the terrestrial.  <a name="C15V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:41</font></a> There is one glory of the sun,
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star
differs from another star in glory.  <a name="C15V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:42</font></a> So also is the resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.  <a name="C15V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:43</font></a> It is sown in dishonor; it is
raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  <a name="C15V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:44</font></a> It is sown a natural body; it is
raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a
spiritual body.
<p> <a name="C15V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:45</font></a> So also it is
written, &quot;The first man, Adam, became a living soul.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N18">*</a></sup></font> The last
Adam became a life-giving spirit.  <a name="C15V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:46</font></a> However that which is spiritual
isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.
 <a name="C15V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:47</font></a> The first man is of the
earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.  <a name="C15V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:48</font></a> As is the one made of dust, such
are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they
also that are heavenly.  <a name="C15V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:49</font></a> As we have borne the image of
those made of dust, <a href="#N19">let's</a> also bear the image of the
heavenly.  <a name="C15V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:50</font></a> Now I say
this, <a href="#N20">brothers,</a> that flesh and blood can't inherit the
Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
<p> <a name="C15V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:51</font></a> Behold, I tell you a
mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,  <a name="C15V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:52</font></a> in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will
be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.  <a name="C15V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:53</font></a> For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  <a name="C15V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:54</font></a> But when this corruptible will
have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality,
then what is written will happen:
<dl> <dt>&quot;Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N21">*</a></sup></font>
<dt> <a name="C15V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:55</font></a> &quot;Death, where
is your sting?
<dd><a href="#N22">Hades</a>, where is your victory?&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C15V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:56</font></a> The sting of death is
sin, and the power of sin is the law.  <a name="C15V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:57</font></a> But thanks be to God, who gives
us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <a name="C15V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:58</font></a> Therefore, my beloved brothers,
be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you
know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> Now concerning the
collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you
do likewise.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> On the first
day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no
collections be made when I come.  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> When I arrive, I will send
whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
 <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> If it is appropriate for
me to go also, they will go with me.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> But I will come to you when I
have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> But with you it may be that I
will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I
go.  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> For I do not wish to
see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord
permits.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> But I will stay
at Ephesus until Pentecost,  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> for a great and effective door
has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> Now if Timothy comes, see that
he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also
do.  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> Therefore let no one
despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come
to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
<p> <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> Now concerning
Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the
brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come
when he has an opportunity.
<p> <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> Watch! Stand firm in
the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!  <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> Let all that you do be done in
love.
<p> <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> Now I beg you,
brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of
Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),  <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> that you also be in subjection
to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.  <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> I rejoice at the coming of
Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your
part, they supplied.  <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> For
they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are
like that.
<p> <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> The assemblies of
Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together
with the assembly that is in their house.  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> All the brothers greet you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
<p> <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> This greeting is by
me, Paul, with my own hand.  <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> If any man doesn't love the Lord
Jesus Christ, let him be <a href="#N24">accursed</a>. <a href="#N25">Come,
Lord!</a>  <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> The grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> My love to all of you in Christ
Jesus. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER<br>
