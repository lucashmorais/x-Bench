<h1 id="d0e106">The Title.</h1>
<p id="d0e111">"Book of the Dead" is the title now commonly given to the great collection of funerary texts which the ancient Egyptian scribes
composed for the benefit of the dead. These consist of spells and incantations, hymns and litanies, magical formulae and names,
words of power and prayers, and they are found cut or painted on walls of pyramids and tombs, and painted on coffins and sarcophagi
and rolls of papyri. The title "Book of the Dead" is somewhat unsatisfactory and misleading, for the texts neither form a
connected work nor belong to one period; they are miscellaneous in character, and tell us nothing about the lives and works
of the dead with whom they were buried. Moreover, the Egyptians possessed many funerary works that might rightly be called
"Books of the Dead," but none of them bore a name that could be translated by the title "Book of the Dead." This title was
given to the great collection of funerary texts in the first quarter of the nineteenth century by the pioneer Egyptologists,
who possessed no exact knowledge of their contents. They were familiar with the rolls of papyrus inscribed in the hieroglyphic
and the hieratic character, for copies of several had been published,<a id="d0e113src" href="#d0e113" class="noteref">1</a> but the texts in them were short and fragmentary. The publication of the Facsimile<a id="d0e128src" href="#d0e128" class="noteref">2</a> of the Papyrus of Peta-Amen-neb-nest-taui<a id="d0e134src" href="#d0e134" class="noteref">3</a> by <span id="d0e147" class="pageno">page 2</span>M. Cadet in 1805 made a long hieroglyphic text and numerous coloured vignettes available for study, and the French Egyptologists
described it as a copy of the "Rituel Fun&eacute;raire" of the ancient Egyptians. Among these was Champollion le Jeune, but later, on his return from Egypt, he and others called
it "Le Livre des Morts," "The Book of the Dead," "Das Todtenbuch," etc. These titles are merely translations of the name given by the Egyptian tomb-robbers to every roll of inscribed papyrus
which they found with mummies, namely, "Kit&acirc;b-al-Mayyit," "Book of the dead man," or "Kit&acirc;b al-Mayyitun," "Book of the dead"
(<i>plur.</i>). These men knew nothing of the contents of such a roll, and all they meant to say was that it was "a dead man's book," and
that it was found in his coffin with him.

<h1 id="d0e163">The Preservation of the Mummified Body in the Tomb by Thoth.</h1>
<p id="d0e168">The objects found in the graves of the predynastic Egyptians, <i>i.e.</i>, vessels of food, flint knives and other weapons, etc., prove that these early dwellers in the Nile Valley believed in some
kind of a future existence. But as the art of writing was, unknown to them their graves contain no inscriptions, and we can
only infer from texts of the dynastic period what their ideas about the Other World were. It is clear that they did not consider
it of great importance to preserve the dead body in as complete and perfect state as possible, for in many of their graves
the heads, hands and feet have been found severed from the trunks and lying at some distance from them. On the other hand,
the dynastic Egyptians, either as the result of a difference in religious belief, or under the influence of invaders who had
settled in their country, attached supreme importance to the preservation and integrity of the dead body, and they adopted
every means known to them to prevent its dismemberment and decay. They cleansed it and embalmed it with drugs, spices and
balsams; they anointed it with aromatic oils and preservative fluids; they swathed it in hundreds of yards of linen bandages;
and then they sealed it up in a coffin or sarcophagus, which they laid in a chamber hewn in the bowels of the mountain. All
<span id="d0e173" class="pageno">page 3</span>these things were done to protect the physical body against damp, dry rot and decay, and against the attacks of moth, beetles,
worms and wild animals. But these were not the only enemies of the dead against which precautions had to be taken, for both
the mummified body and the spiritual elements which had inhabited it upon earth had to be protected from a multitude of devils
and fiends, and from the powers of darkness generally. These powers of evil had hideous and terrifying shapes and forms, and
their haunts were well known, for they infested the region through which the road of the dead lay when passing from this world
to the Kingdom of Osiris. The "great gods" were afraid of them, and were obliged to protect themselves by the use of spells
and magical names, and words of power, which were composed and written down by Thoth. In fact it was believed in very early
times in Egypt that R&#257; the Sun-god owed his continued existence to the possession of a secret name with which Thoth had provided
him. And each morning the rising sun was menaced by a fearful monster called &#256;apep, <img src="img/hg0301.png" alt="">, which lay hidden under the place of sunrise waiting to swallow up the solar disk. It was impossible, even for the Sun-god,
to destroy this "Great Devil," but by reciting each morning the powerful spell with which Thoth had provided him he was able
to paralyse all &#256;apep's limbs and to rise upon this world. Since then the "great gods," even though benevolently disposed
towards them, were not able to deliver the dead from the devils that lived upon the "bodies, souls, spirits, shadows and hearts
of the dead," the Egyptians decided to invoke the aid of Thoth on behalf of their dead and to place them under the protection
of his almighty spells. Inspired by Thoth the theologians of ancient Egypt composed a large number of funerary texts which
were certainly in general use under the IVth dynasty (about 3700 B.C.), and were probably well known under the Ist dynasty,
and throughout the whole period of dynastic history Thoth was regarded as the author of the "Book of the Dead."

<h1 id="d0e193">The Book Per-t em hru, or [The Chapters of] Coming forth by (or, into) the Day, commonly called the "Book of the Dead."</h1>
<p id="d0e198">The spells and other texts which were written by Thoth for the benefit of the dead, and are directly connected with him, were
called, according to documents written under the XIth and XVIIIth dynasties, "Chapters of the Coming Forth by (or, into) the
Day," <img src="img/hg0401.png" alt="">
<img src="img/hg0402.png" alt="">. One rubric in the Papyrus of Nu (Brit. Mus. No. 10477) states that the text of the work called "PER-T EM HRU," <i>i.e</i>., "Coming Forth (or, into) the Day," was discovered by a high official in the foundations of a shrine of the god Hennu during
the reign of Semti, or Hesepti, a king of the Ist dynasty. Another rubric in the same papyrus says that the text was cut upon
the alabaster plinth of a statue of Menkaur&#257; (Mycerinus), a king of the IVth dynasty, and that the letters were inlaid with
lapis lazuli. The plinth was found by Prince Herutataf, <img src="img/hg0403.png" alt="">, a son of King Khufu (Cheops), who carried it off to his king and exhibited it as a "most wonderful" thing. This composition
was greatly reverenced, for it "would make a man victorious upon earth and in the Other World; it would ensure him a safe
and free passage through the Tuat (Under World); it would allow him to go in and to go out, and to take at any time any form
he pleased; it would make his soul to flourish, and would prevent him from dying the [second] death." For the deceased to
receive the full benefit of this text it had to be recited by a man "who was ceremonially pure, and who had not eaten fish
or meat, and had not consorted with women." On coffins of the XIth dynasty and on papyri of the XVIIIth dynasty we find two
versions of the PER-T EM HRU, one long and one short. As the title of the shorter version states that it is the "Chapters
of the PER-T EM HRU in a single chapter," it is clear that this work, even under the IVth dynasty, contained many "Chapters,"
and that a much abbreviated form of the work was also current at the same period. The rubric that attributes the "finding"
of the Chapter to Herutataf associates <span id="d0e209" class="pageno">page 5</span>it with Khemenu, <i>i.e</i>., Hermopolis, and indicates that Thoth, the god of this city, was its author.

</div>
<p id="d0e230">The work PER-T EM HRU received many additions in the course of centuries, and at length, under the XVIIIth dynasty, it contained
about 190 distinct compositions, or "Chapters." The original forms of many of these are to be found in the <span id="d0e232" class="pageno">page 6</span>"Pyramid Texts" (<i>i.e</i>., the funerary compositions cut on the walls of the chambers and corridors of the pyramids of Kings Unas, Teta, Pepi I Meri-R&#257;,
Merenra and Pepi II at Sakk&acirc;rah), which were written under the Vth and VIth dynasties. The forms which many other chapters
had under the XIth and XIIth dynasties are well represented by the texts painted on the coffins of Amamu, Sen, and Guatep
in the British Museum (Nos. 6654, 30839, 30841), but it is possible that both these and the so-called "Pyramid Texts" all
belonged to the work PER-T EM HRU, and are extracts from it. The "Pyramid Texts" have no illustrations, but a few of the texts
on the coffins of the XIth and XIIth dynasties have coloured vignettes, <i>e.g</i>., those which refer to the region to be traversed by the deceased on his way to the Other World, and the Islands of the Blessed
or the Elysian Fields. On the upper margins of the insides of such coffins there are frequently given two or more rows of
coloured drawings of the offerings which under the Vth dynasty were presented to the deceased or his statue during the celebration
of the service of "Opening the Mouth" and the performance of the ceremonies of "The Liturgy of Funerary Offerings." Under
the XVIIIth dynasty, when the use of large rectangular coffins and sarcophagi fell somewhat into disuse, the scribes began
to write collections of Chapters from the PER-T EM HRU on rolls of papyri instead of on coffins. At first the texts were written
in hieroglyphs, the greater number of them being in black ink, and an attempt was made to illustrate each text by a vignette
drawn in black outline. The finest known example of such a codex is the Papyrus of Nebseni (Brit. Mus. No. 9900), which is
77 feet 7&frac12; inches in length and I foot I&frac12; inches in breadth. Early in the XVIIIth dynasty scribes began to write the titles
of the Chapters, the rubrics, and the catchwords in red ink and the text in black, and it became customary to decorate the
vignettes with colours, and to increase their size and number. The oldest codex of this class is the Papyrus of Nu (Brit.
Mus. No. 10477) which is 65 feet 3&frac12; inches in length, and 1 foot 1&frac12; inches in breadth. This and many other rolls were written
by their owners for their own tombs, and in each roll both text and vignettes were usually, the work of the same hand. Later,
however, the scribe wrote the text only, and a skilled artist was employed to add the coloured vignettes, for <span id="d0e240" class="pageno">page 7</span>which spaces were marked out and left blank by the scribe. The finest example of this class of roll is the Papyrus of Ani
(Brit. Mus., No. 10470). which is 78 feet in length and 1 foot 3 inches in breadth. In all papyri of this class the text is
<span id="d0e242" class="pageno">page 8</span>written in hieroglyphs, but under the XIXth and following dynasties many papyri are written throughout in the hieratic character; these usually lack vignettes, but have coloured frontispieces.

</div>
<p id="d0e284">Under the rule of the High Priests of Amen many changes were introduced into the contents of the papyri, and the arrangement
cf the texts and vignettes of the PER-T EM HRU was altered. The great confraternity of Amen-R&#257;, the "King of the Gods," felt
it to be necessary to emphasize the supremacy of their god, even in the Kingdom of Osiris, and they added many prayers, litanies
and hymns to the Sun-god to every selection of the texts from the PER-T EM HRU that was copied on a roll of papyrus for funerary
purposes. The greater number of the rolls of this period are short and contain only a few Chapters, <i>e.g.</i>, the Papyrus of the Royal Mother Netchemet (Brit. Mus. No. 10541) and the Papyrus of Queen Netchemet (Brit. Mus. No. 10478).
In some the text is very defective and carelessly written, but the coloured vignettes are remarkable for their size and beauty;
of this class of roll the finest example is the Papyrus of Anhai (Brit. Mus. No. 10472). The most interesting of all the rolls
that were written during the rule of the Priest-Kings over Upper Egypt is the Papyrus of Princess Nesitanebtashru (Brit. Mus.
No. 10554), now commonly known as the "Greenfield Papyrus." <span id="d0e289" class="pageno">page 9</span>
<span id="d0e291" class="pageno">page 10</span>It is the longest and widest funerary papyrus<a id="d0e293src" href="#d0e293" class="noteref">1</a> known, for it measures 123 feet by 1 foot 6&frac12; inches, and it contains more Chapters, Hymns, Litanies, Adorations and Homages
to the gods than any other roll. The 87 Chapters from the PER-T EM HRU which it contains prove the princess's devotion to
the cult of Osiris, and the Hymns to Amen-R&#257; show that she was able to regard this god and Osiris not as rivals but as two
aspects of the same god. She believed that the "hidden" creative power which was materialized in Amen was only another form
of the power of procreation, renewed birth and resurrection which was typified by Osiris. The oldest copies of the PER-T EM
HRU which we have on papyrus contain a few extracts from other ancient funerary works, such as the "Book of Opening the Mouth,"
the "Liturgy of Funerary Offerings," and the "Book of the Two Ways." But under the rule of the Priest-Kings the scribes incorporated
with the Chapters of the PER-T EM HRU extracts from the "Book of Ami-Tuat" and the "Book of Gates," and several of the vignettes
and texts that are found on the walls of the royal tombs of Thebes.

<p id="d0e315">One of the most remarkable texts written at this period is found in the Papyrus of Nesi-Khensu, which is now in the Egyptian
Museum in Cairo. This is really the copy of a contract which is declared to have been made between Nesi-Khensu and Amen-R&#257;,
"the holy god, the lord of all the gods." As a reward for the great piety of the queen, and her devotion to the interests
of Amen-R&#257; upon earth, the god undertakes to make her a goddess in his kingdom, to provide her with an estate there in perpetuity
and a never-failing supply of offerings, and happiness of heart, soul and body, and the [daily] recital upon earth of the
"Seventy Songs of R&#257;" for the benefit of her soul in the Khert-Neter, or Under World. The contract was drawn up in a series
of paragraphs in legal phraseology by the priests of Amen, who believed they had the power of making their god do as they
pleased when they pleased.

<p id="d0e342">Little is known of the history of the PER-T EM HRU after the downfall of the priests of Amen, and during the period of the
rule of the Nubians, but under the kings of the XXVIth dynasty <span id="d0e344" class="pageno">page 11</span>
<span id="d0e346" class="pageno">page 12</span>the Book enjoyed a great vogue. Many funerary rolls were written both in hieroglyphs and hieratic, and were decorated with
vignettes drawn in black outline; and about this time the scribes began to write funerary texts in the demotic character.
But men no longer copied long selections from the PER-T EM HRU as they had done under the XVIIIth, XIXth and XXth <span id="d0e348" class="pageno">page 13</span> dynasties, partly because the religious views of the Egyptians had undergone a great change, and partly because a number
of Books of the Dead of a more popular character had appeared. The cult of Osiris was triumphant everywhere, and men preferred
the hymns and litanies which dealt with his sufferings, death and resurrection to the compositions in which the absolute supremacy
of R&#257; and his solar cycle of gods and goddesses was assumed or proclaimed. Thus, in the "Lamentations of Isis" and the "Festival
Songs of Isis and Nephthys," and the "Litanies of Seker," and the "Book of Honouring Osiris," etc., the central figure is
Osiris, and he alone is regarded as the giver of everlasting life. The dead were no longer buried with large rolls of papyrus
filled with Chapters of the PER-T EM HRU laid in their coffins, but with small sheets or strips of papyrus, on which were
inscribed the above compositions, or the shorter texts of the "Book of Breathings," or the "Book of Traversing Eternity,"
or the "Book of May my name flourish," or a part of the "Chapter of the Last Judgment."

of the alphabet and the art of writing, and the science of mathematics. At a very <span id="d0e392" class="pageno">page 15</span>early period he was called the "scribe (or secretary) of the Great Company of the Gods," and as he kept the celestial register
of the words and deeds of men, he was regarded by many generations of Egyptians as the "Recording Angel." He was the inventor
of physical and moral Law and became the personification of JUSTICE; and as the Companies of the Gods of Heaven, and Earth,
and the Other World appointed him to "weigh the words and deeds" of men, and his verdicts were unalterable, he became more
powerful in the Other World than Osiris himself. Osiris owed his triumph over Set in the Great Judgment Hall of the Gods entirely
to the skill of Thoth of the "wise mouth" as an Advocate, and to his influence with the gods in heaven. And every follower
of Osiris relied upon the advocacy of Thoth to secure his acquittal on the Day of Judgment, and to procure for him an everlasting
habitation in the Kingdom of Osiris.

<h1 id="d0e405">Thoth and Osiris.</h1>
<p id="d0e410">The Egyptians were not satisfied with the mere possession of the texts of Thoth, when their souls were being weighed in the
Great Scales in the Judgment Hall of Osiris, but they also wished Thoth to act as their Advocate on this dread occasion and
to prove their innocence as he had proved that of Osiris before the great gods in prehistoric times. According to a very ancient
Egyptian tradition, the god Osiris, who was originally the god of the principle of the fertility of the Nile, became incarnate
on earth as the son of Geb, the Earth-god, and Nut, the Sky-goddess. He had two sisters, Isis and Nephthys, and one brother,
Set; he married Isis and Set married Nephthys. Geb set Osiris on the throne of Egypt, and his rule was beneficent <span id="d0e412" class="pageno">page 16</span>and the nation was happy and prosperous. Set marked this and became very jealous of his brother, and wished to slay him so
that he might seize his throne and take possession of Isis, whose reputation as a devoted and loving wife and able manager
filled the country. By some means or other Set did contrive to kill Osiris: according to one story he killed him by the side
of a canal at Netat, <img src="img/hg1601.png" alt="">, near Abydos, and according to another he caused him to be drowned. Isis, accompanied by her sister Nephthys, went to Netat
and rescued the body of her lord, and the two sisters, with the help of Anpu, a son of R&#257; the Sun-god, embalmed it. They then
laid the body in a tomb, and a sycamore tree grew round it and flourished over the grave. A tradition which is found in the
Pyramid Texts states that before Osiris was laid in his tomb, his wife Isis, by means of her magical powers, succeeded in
restoring him to life temporarily, and made him beget of her an heir, who was called Horus. After the burial of Osiris, Isis
retreated to the marshes in the Delta, and there she brought forth Horus. In order to avoid the persecution of Set, who on
one occasion succeeded in killing Horus by the sting of a scorpion, she fled from place to place in the Delta, and lived a
very unhappy life for some years. But Thoth helped her in all her difficulties and provided her with the words of power which
restored Horus to life, and enabled her to pass unharmed among the crocodiles and other evil beasts that infested the waters
of the Delta at that time.

<p id="d0e447">When Horus arrived at years of maturity, he set out to find Set and to wage war against his father's murderer. At length they
met and a fierce fight ensued, and though Set was defeated before he was finally hurled to the ground, he succeeded in tearing
out the right eye of Horus and keeping it. Even after this fight Set was able to persecute Isis, and Horus was powerless to
prevent it <span id="d0e449" class="pageno">page 17</span>until Thoth made Set give him the right eye of Horus which he had carried off. Thoth then brought the eye to Horus, and replaced
it in his face, and restored sight to it by spitting upon it. Horus then sought out the body of Osiris in order to raise it
up to life, and when he found it he untied the bandages so that Osiris might move his limbs, and rise up. Under the direction
of Thoth Horus recited a series of formulas as he presented offerings to Osiris, and he and his sons and Anubis performed
the ceremonies which opened the mouth, and nostrils, and the eyes and the ears of <span id="d0e451" class="pageno">page 18</span>Osiris. He embraced Osiris and so transferred to him his <i>ka</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, his own living personality and virility, and gave him his eye which Thoth had rescued from Set and had replaced in his face.
As soon as Osiris had eaten the eye of Horus he became endowed with a soul and vital power, and recovered thereby the complete
use of all his mental faculties, which death had suspended. Straightway he rose up from his bier and became the Lord of the
Dead and King of the Under World. Osiris became the type and symbol of resurrection among the Egyptians of all periods, because
he was a god who had been originally a mortal and had risen from the dead.
</p>
<p id="d0e460">But before Osiris became King of the Under World he suffered further persecution from Set. Piecing together a number of disconnected
hints and brief statements in the texts, it seems pretty clear either that Osiris appealed to the "Great Gods" to take notice
that Set had murdered him, or that Set brought a series of charges against Osiris. At all events the "Great Gods" determined
to investigate the matter. The Greater and the Lesser Companies of the Gods assembled in the celestial Anu, or Heliopolis,
and ordered Osiris to stand up and defend himself against the charges brought against him by Set. Isis and Nephthys brought
him before the gods, and Horus, "the avenger of his father," came to watch the case on behalf of his father, Osiris. Thoth
appeared in the Hall of Judgment in his official capacity as "scribe," <i>i.e.</i>, secretary to the gods, and the hearing of the evidence began. Set seems to have pleaded his own cause, and to have repeated
the charges which he had made against Osiris. The defence of Osiris was undertaken by Thoth, who proved to the gods that the
charges brought against Osiris by Set were unfounded, that the statements of Set were lies, and that therefore Set was a liar.
The gods accepted Thoth's proof of the innocence of Osiris and the guilt of Set, and ordered that Osiris was to be considered
a Great God and to have rule over the Kingdom of the Under World, and that Set was to be punished. Thoth convinced them that
Osiris was "MA&#256; KHERU," <img src="img/hg1801.png" alt="">, "true of word," <i>i.e.</i>, that he had spoken the truth when he gave his evidence, and in texts of all periods Thoth is frequently described as S-MA&#256;
KHERU ASAR, <span id="d0e470" class="pageno">page 19</span>
<img src="img/hg1901.png" alt="">, <i>i.e.</i>, he who proved Osiris to be "true of word." As for Set the Liar, he was seized by the ministers of the Great Gods, who threw
him down on his hands and face and made Osiris mount upon his back as a mark of his victory and superiority. After this Set
was bound with cords like a beast for sacrifice, and in the presence of Thoth was hacked in pieces.
</p>
<h1 id="d0e479">Osiris as Judge of the Dead and King of the Under World.</h1>
<p id="d0e484">When Set was destroyed Osiris departed from this world to the kingdom which the gods had given him and began to reign over
the dead. He was absolute king of this realm, just as R&#257; the Sun-god was absolute king of the sky. This region of the dead,
or Dead-land, is called "Tat," <img src="img/hg1902.png" alt="">, or "Tuat," <img src="img/hg1903.png" alt="">, but where the Egyptians thought it was situated is not quite clear. The original home of the cult of Osiris was in the Delta,
in a city which in historic times was called Tetu by the Egyptians and Busiris by the Greeks, and it is reasonable to assume
that the Tuat, over which Osiris ruled, was situated near this place. Wherever it was it was not underground, and it was not
originally in the sky or even on its confines; but it was located on the borders of the visible world, in the Outer Darkness.
The Tuat was not a place of happiness, judging from the description of it in the PER-T EM HRU, or Book of the Dead. When Ani
the scribe arrived there he said, "What is this to which I have come? There is neither water nor air here, its depth is unfathomable,
it is as dark as the darkest night, and men wander about here helplessly. A man cannot live here and be satisfied, and he
cannot gratify the cravings of affection" (Chapter CLXXV). In the Tuat there was neither tree nor plant, for it was the "land
where nothing grew"; and in primitive times it was a region of destruction and death, a place where the dead rotted and decayed,
a place of abomination, and horror and terror, and annihilation. But in very early times, certainly <span id="d0e490" class="pageno">page 20</span>in the Neolithic Period, the Egyptians believed in some kind of a future life, and they dimly conceived that the attainment
of that life might possibly depend upon the manner of life which those who hoped to enjoy it led here. The Egyptians "hated
death and loved life," and when the belief gained ground among them that Osiris, the God of the Dead, had himself risen from
the dead, and had been acquitted by the gods of heaven after a searching trial, and had the power to "make men and women to
be born again," and "to renew life" because of his truth and righteousness, they came to regard him as the Judge as well as
the God of the Dead. As time went on, and moral and religious ideas developed among the Egyptians, it became certain to them
that only those who had satisfied Osiris as to their truth-speaking and honest dealing upon earth could hope for admission
into his kingdom.
</p>
<p id="d0e493">When the power of Osiris became predominant in the Under World, and his fame as a just and righteous judge became well established
among the natives of Lower and Upper Egypt, it was universally believed that after death all men would appear before him in
his dread Hall of Judgment to receive their reward or their sentence of doom. The writers of the Pyramid Texts, more than
fifty-five centuries ago, dreamed of a time when heaven and earth and men did not exist, when the gods had not yet been born,
when death had not been created, <img src="img/hg2001.png" alt="">
<img src="img/hg2002.png" alt="">

<img src="img/hg2005.png" alt="">
<img src="img/hg2006.png" alt="">
<img src="img/hg2007.png" alt="">, and when anger, speech (?), cursing and rebellion were unknown.<a id="d0e509src" href="#d0e509" class="noteref">1</a> But that time was very remote, and long before the great fight took place between Horus and Set, when the former lost his
eye and the latter was wounded in a vital part of his body. Meanwhile death had come into the world, and since the religion
of Osiris gave man a hope of escape from death, and the promise of everlasting life of the peculiar kind that appealed to
the great mass of the Egyptian people, the spread of the cult of Osiris and its ultimate triumph over all forms of religion
in Egypt were assured. Under the early dynasties the priesthood of Anu (the On of <span id="d0e512" class="pageno">page 21</span>the Bible) strove to make their Sun-god R&#257; pre-eminent in Egypt, but the cult of this god never appealed to the people as
a whole. It was embraced by the Pharaohs, and their high officials, and some of the nobles, and the official priesthood, but
the reward which its doctrine offered was not popular with the materialistic Egyptians. A life passed in the Boat of R&#257; with
the gods, being arrayed in light and fed upon light, made no appeal to the ordinary folk since Osiris offered them as a reward
a life in the Field of Reeds, and the Field of Offerings of Food, and the Field of the Grasshoppers, and everlasting existence
in a transmuted and beautified body among the resurrected bodies of father and mother, wife and children, kinsfolk and friends.

<p id="d0e527">But, as according to the cult of R&#257;, the wicked, the rebels, and the blasphemers of the Sun-god suffered swift and final punishment,
so also all those who had sinned against the stern moral Law of Osiris, and who had failed to satisfy its demands, paid the
penalty without delay. The Judgment of R&#257; was held at sunrise, and the wicked were thrown into deep pits filled with fire,
and their bodies, souls, shadows and hearts were consumed forthwith. The Judgment of Osiris took place near Abydos, probably
at midnight, and a decree of swift annihilation was passed by him on the damned. Their heads were cut off by the headsman
of Osiris, who was called Shesmu, <img src="img/hg2101.png" alt="">, and their bodies dismembered and destroyed in pits of fire. There was no eternal punishment for men, for the wicked were
annihilated quickly and completely; but inasmuch as Osiris sat in judgment and doomed the wicked to destruction daily, the
infliction of punishment never ceased.

<h1 id="d0e535">The Judgment of Osiris.</h1>
<p id="d0e540">The oldest religious texts suggest that the Egyptians always associated the Last Judgment with the weighing of the heart in
a pair of scales, and in the illustrated papyri of the Book of the Dead great prominence is always given to the vignettes
in which this weighing is being carried out. The heart, <i>ab</i>
<img src="img/hg2201.png" alt="">, was taken as the symbol of all the emotions, desires, and passions, both good and evil, and out of it proceeded the issues
of life. It was intimately connected with the <i>ka</i>, <img src="img/hg2202.png" alt="">, <i>i.e.</i>, the double or personality of a man, and several short spells in the Book PER-T EM HRU were composed to ensure its preservation
(Chapters XXVI&#8211;XXXB*). The great Chapter of the Judgment of Osiris, the CXXVth, is divided into three parts, which are sometimes
(as in the Papyrus of Ani) prefaced by a Hymn to Osiris. The first part contains the following, which was said by the deceased
when he entered the Hall of Ma&#257;ti, in which Osiris sat in judgment:
</p>
<p id="d0e556">"Homage to thee, O Great God, Lord of Ma&#257;ti,<a id="d0e558src" href="#d0e558" class="noteref">1</a> I have come to thee, O my Lord, that I may behold thy beneficence. I know thee, and I know thy name, and the names of the
Forty-Two who live with thee in the Hall of Ma&#257;ti, who keep ward over sinners, and feed upon their blood on the day of estimating
characters before Un-Nefer<a id="d0e564src" href="#d0e564" class="noteref">2</a> ... Behold, I have come to thee, and I have brought <i>ma&#257;t</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, truth, integrity) to thee. I have destroyed sin for thee. I have not sinned against men. I have not oppressed [my] kinsfolk.
I have done no wrong in the place of truth. I have not known worthless folk. I have not wrought evil. I have not defrauded
the oppressed one of his goods. I have not done the things that the gods abominate. I have not vilified a servant to his master.
I have not caused pain. I have not let any man hunger. I have made no one to weep. I have not committed murder. I have not
commanded any to commit murder for me. I have inflicted pain on no man. I have not defrauded the temples <span id="d0e573" class="pageno">page 23</span> of their oblations. I have not purloined the cakes of the gods. I have not stolen the offerings to the spirits (<i>i.e.</i>, the dead). I have not committed fornication. I have not polluted myself in the holy places of the god of my city. I have
not diminished from the bushel. I did not take from or add to the acre-measure. I did not encroach on the fields [of others].
I have not added to the weights of the scales. I have not misread the pointer of the scales. I have not taken milk from the
mouths of children. I have not driven cattle from their pastures. I have not snared the birds of the gods. I have not caught
fish with fish of their kind. I have not stopped water [when it should flow]. I have not cut the dam of a canal. I have not
extinguished a fire when it should burn. I have not altered the times of the chosen meat offerings. I have not turned away
the cattle [intended for] offerings. I have not repulsed the god at his appearances. I am pure. I am pure. I am pure. I am
pure...."
</p>
<p id="d0e579">In the second part of Chapter CXXV Osiris is seen seated at one end of the Hall of Ma&#257;ti accompanied by the two goddesses
of Law and Truth, and the Forty-Two gods who are there to assist him. Each of the Forty-Two gods represents one of the nomes
of Egypt and has a symbolic name. When the deceased had repeated the magical names of the doors of the Hall, he entered it
and saw these gods arranged in two rows, twenty-one on each side of the Hall. At the end, near Osiris, were the Great Scales,
under the charge of Anpu (Anubis), and the monster &#256;memit, the Eater of the Dead, <i>i.e.</i>, of the hearts of the wicked who were condemned in the Judgment of Osiris. The deceased advanced along the Hall and, addressing
each of the Forty-Two gods by his name, declared that he had not committed a certain sin, thus:
</p>
<p id="d0e585">"O Usekh-nemmit, comer forth from Anu, I have not committed sin.
</p>
<p id="d0e588">"O Fenti, comer forth from Khemenu, I have not robbed.
</p>
<p id="d0e591">"O Neha-h&#257;u, comer forth from Re-stau, I have not killed men.
</p>
<p id="d0e594">"O Neba, comer forth in retreating, I have not plundered the property of God.
</p>
<p id="d0e597">"O Set-qesu, comer forth from Hensu, I have not lied.
</p>
<p id="d0e600">"O Uammti, comer forth from Khebt, I have not defiled any man's wife.
</p>
<p id="d0e603">
<span id="d0e605" class="pageno">page 24</span>"O Maa-anuf, comer forth from Per-Menu, I have not defiled myself.
</p>
<p id="d0e608">"O Tem-Sep, comer forth from Tetu, I have not cursed the king.
</p>
<p id="d0e611">"O Nefer-Tem, comer forth from Het-ka-Ptah, I have not acted deceitfully; I have not committed wickedness.
</p>
<p id="d0e614">"O Nekhen, comer forth from Heq&#257;t, I have not turned a deaf ear to the words of the Law (or Truth)."
</p>
<p id="d0e617">The names of most of the Forty-Two gods are not ancient, but were invented by the priests probably about the same time as
the names in the Book of Him that is in the Tuat and the Book of Gates, <i>i.e.</i>, between the XIIth and the XVIIIth dynasties. Their artificial character is shown by their meanings. Thus Usekh-nemmit means
"He of the long strides"; Fenti means "He of the Nose"; Neha-h&#257;u means "Stinking-members"; Set-qesu means "Breaker of bones,"
etc. The early Egyptologists called the second part of the CXXVth Chapter the "Negative Confession," and it is generally known
by this somewhat inexact title to this day.
</p>
<p id="d0e623">In the third part of the CXXVth Chapter comes the address which the deceased made to the gods after he had declared his innocence
of the sins enumerated before the Forty-Two gods. He says: "Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in your Hall of Ma&#257;ti. I know
you and I know your names. Let me not fall under your slaughtering knives. Bring not my wickedness to the notice of the god
whose followers ye are. Let not the affair [of my judgment] come under your jurisdiction. Speak ye the Law (or truth) concerning
me before Neb-er-tcher,<a id="d0e625src" href="#d0e625" class="noteref">3</a> for I performed the Law (or, truth) in Ta-mera (<i>i.e.</i>, Egypt). I have not blasphemed the God. No affair of mine came under the notice of the king in his day. Homage to you, O
ye who are in your Hall of Ma&#257;ti, who have no lies in your bodies, who live on truth, who eat truth before Horus, the dweller
in his disk, deliver ye me from Babai<a id="d0e634src" href="#d0e634" class="noteref">4</a> who liveth upon the entrails of the mighty ones on the day of the Great Reckoning (APT &#256;AT, <img src="img/hg2401.png" alt="">). Behold me! I have come <span id="d0e641" class="pageno">page 25</span>to you without sin, without deceit (?), without evil, without false testimony (?) I have not done an [evil] thing. I live
upon truth and I feed upon truth. I have performed the behests of men, and the things that satisfy the gods.<a id="d0e643src" href="#d0e643" class="noteref">5</a> I have propitiated the God [by doing] His will. I have given bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, raiment to the naked,
and a boat to him that needed one. I have made holy offerings to the gods, and sepulchral offerings to the beautified dead. Be ye then my saviours, be ye my protectors, and make no accusation against me before the Great God. I am pure of mouth,
and clean of hands; therefore it hath been said by those who saw me, 'Come in peace, come in peace.'"
</p>
<p id="d0e653">The deceased then addresses Osiris, and says, "Hail, thou who art exalted upon thy standard, thou Lord of the Atefu Crown,
whose name is 'Lord of Winds,' save me from thy Messengers (or Assessors) with uncovered faces, who bring charges of evil
and make shortcomings plain, because I have performed the Law (or Truth) for the Lord of the Law (or Truth). I have purified
myself with washings in water, my back hath been cleansed with salt, and my inner parts are in the Pool of Truth. There is
not a member of mine that lacketh truth." From the lines that follow the above in the Papyrus of Nu it seems as though the
judgment of the deceased by the Forty-Two gods was preliminary to the final judgment of Osiris. At all events, after questioning
him about the performance of certain ceremonies, they invited him to enter the Hall of Ma&#257;ti, but when he was about to do
so the porter, and the door-bolts, and the various parts of the door and its frame, and the floor, refused to permit him to
enter until he had repeated their magical names. When he had pronounced these correctly the porter took him in and presented
him to Maau (?)-Taui, who was Thoth himself. When asked by him why he had come the deceased answered, "I have come that report
may be made of me." Then Thoth said, "What is thy condition?" And the deceased replied, "I am purified from evil things, I
am free from the wickedness of those who lived in my days; I am not one of them." On this Thoth said, "Thou shalt be reported.
[Tell me:] Who is he whose roof is fire, whose walls are living <span id="d0e655" class="pageno">page 26</span>
<span id="d0e657" class="pageno">page 27</span>serpents, and whose floor is a stream of water? Who is he?" The deceased having replied "Osiris," Thoth then led him forward
to the god Osiris, who received him, and promised that subsistence should be provided for him from the Eye of R&#257;.

<p id="d0e667">[From the Papyrus of Ani. Brit. Mus., Pap., No. 10470.]</p>
</div>
<p id="d0e672">In great papyri of the Book of the Dead such as those of Nebseni, Nu, Ani, Hunefer, etc., the Last Judgment, or the "Great
Reckoning," is made the most prominent scene in the whole work, and the vignette in which it is depicted is several feet long.
The most complete form of it is given in the Papyrus of Ani, and may be thus described: At one end of the Hall of Ma&#257;ti Osiris
is seated on a throne within a shrine made in the form of a funerary coffer; behind him stand Isis and Nephthys. Along one
side of the Hall are seated the gods Harmachis, Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Isis and Nephthys, Horus, Hathor, Hu and Saa,
who are to serve as the divine jury; these formed the "Great Company of the Gods" of Anu (Heliopolis). By these stands the
Great Balance, and on its pillar sits the dog-headed ape Astes, or Astenu, the associate of Thoth. The pointer of the Balance
is in the charge of Anpu. Behind Anpu are Thoth the scribe of the gods, and the monster &#256;memit, with the head of a crocodile,
the forepaws and shoulders of a lion, and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus; the duty of the last-named was to eat up the
hearts that were light in the balance. On the other side of the Balance Ani, accompanied by his wife, is seen standing with
head bent low in adoration, and between him and the Balance stand the two goddesses who nurse and rear children, Meskhenet
and Rennet, Ani's soul, in the form of a man-headed hawk, a portion of his body, and his luck Shai. Since the heart was considered
to be the seat of all will, emotion, feeling, reason and intelligence, Ani's heart, <img src="img/hg2701.png" alt="">, is seen in one pan of the Balance, and in the other is the feather, <img src="img/hg2702.png" alt="">, symbolic of truth and righteousness. Whilst his heart was in the Balance Ani, repeating the words of Chapter XXXB* of the
Book of the Dead, addressed it, saying, "My heart of my mother! My heart of my mother! My heart of my being! Make no stand
against me when testifying, thrust me not back before the Tchatchaut (<i>i.e.</i>, the overseers of Osiris), and make no failure in respect of me before the Master of the <span id="d0e681" class="pageno">page 27</span>
<span id="d0e683" class="pageno">page 28</span>Balance. Thou art my Ka, the dweller in my body, uniting (?) and strengthening my members. Thou shalt come forth to the happiness
to which we advance. Make not my name to stink with the officers [of Osiris] who made men, utter no lie against me before
the Great God, the Lord of Amentt."

<p class="figureHead">Horus, Son of Isis, introducing the Scribe Ani to Osiris.</p>
<p id="d0e696">[From the Papyrus of Ani. Brit. Mus., Pap., No. 10470.]</p>
</div>
<p id="d0e701">Then Thoth, the Judge of Truth, of the Great Company of the Gods who are in the presence of Osiris, saith to the gods, "Hearken
ye to this word: In very truth the heart of Osiris hath been weighed, and his soul hath borne testimony concerning him; according
to the Great Balance his case is truth (<i>i.e.</i>, just). No wickedness hath been found in him. He did not filch offerings from the temples. He did not act crookedly, and
he did not vilify folk when he was on earth."
</p>
<p id="d0e707">And the Great Company of the Gods say to Thoth, who dwelleth in Khemenu (Hermopolis): "This that cometh forth from thy mouth
of truth is confirmed (?) The Osiris, the scribe Ani, true of voice, hath testified. He hath not sinned and [his name] doth
not stink before us; &#256;memit (<i>i.e.</i>, the Eater of the Dead) shall not have the mastery over him. Let there be given unto him offerings of food and an appearance
before Osiris, and an abiding homestead in the Field of Offerings as unto the Followers of Horus."
</p>
<p id="d0e713">Thus the gods have declared that Ani is "true of voice," as was Osiris, and they have called Ani "Osiris," because in his
purity of word and deed he resembled that god. In all the copies of the Book of the Dead the deceased is always called "Osiris,"
and as it was always assumed that those for whom they were written would be found innocent when weighed in the Great Balance,
the words "true of voice," which were equivalent in meaning to "innocent and acquitted," were always written after their names.
It may be noted in passing that when Ani's heart was weighed against Truth, the beam of the Great Balance remained perfectly
horizontal. This suggests that the gods did not expect the heart of the deceased to "kick the beam," but were quite satisfied
if it exactly counterbalanced Truth. They demanded the fulfilment of the Law and nothing more, and were content to bestow
immortality upon the man on whom Thoth's verdict was "he hath done no evil," <img src="img/hg2901.png" alt="">
<img src="img/hg2902.png" alt="">.
</p>
<p id="d0e720">
<span id="d0e722" class="pageno">page 30</span>In accordance with the command of the gods Ani passes from the Great Balance to the end of the Hall of Ma&#257;ti where Osiris
is seated, and as he approaches the god Horus, the son of Isis, takes him by the hand and leads him forward, and standing
before his father Osiris says, "I have come to thee, Un-Nefer,<a id="d0e724src" href="#d0e724" class="noteref">6</a> I have brought to thee the Osiris Ani. His heart is righteous [and] hath come forth from the Balance. It hath no sin before
any god or any goddess. Thoth hath set down his judgment in writing, and the Company of the Gods have declared on his behalf
that [his] evidence is very true. Let there be given unto him of the bread and beer which appear before Osiris. Let him be
like the Followers of Horus for ever!" Next we see Ani kneeling in adoration before Osiris, and he says, "Behold, I am in
thy presence, O Lord of Amentt. There is no sin in my body. I have not uttered a lie knowingly. [I have] no duplicity (?)
Grant that I may be like the favoured (or rewarded) ones who are in thy train." Under favour of Osiris Ani then became a <i>s&#257;hu</i>, <img src="img/hg3001.png" alt="">, or "spirit-body," and in this form passed into the Kingdom of Osiris.

<h1 id="d0e737">The Kingdom of Osiris.</h1>
<p id="d0e742">According to the Book of Gates and the other "Guides" to the Egyptian Under World, the Kingdom of Osiris formed the Sixth
Division of the Tuat; in very early times it was situated in the Western Delta, but after the XIIth dynasty theologians placed
it near Abydos in Upper Egypt, and before the close of the Dynastic Period the Tuat of Osiris had absorbed the Under World
of every nome of Egypt. When the soul in its beautified or spirit body arrived there, the ministers of Osiris took it to the homestead or place of abode which had been allotted
to it by the command of Osiris, and there it began its new existence. The large vignette to the CXth Chapter shows us exactly
what manner of place the abode of the blessed was. The country was flat and the fields were intersected by canals <span id="d0e747" class="pageno">page 31</span>of running water in which there were "no fish and no worms" (<i>i.e.</i>, water snakes). In one part of it were several small islands, and on one of them Osiris was supposed to dwell with his saints.
It was called the "Island of Truth," and the ferry-man of Osiris would not convey to it any soul that had not been declared
"true of word" by Thoth, Osiris and the Great Gods at the "Great Reckoning." The portion of the Kingdom of Osiris depicted
in the large Books of the Dead represents in many respects a typical Egyptian farm, and we see the deceased engaged in ploughing
and reaping and driving the oxen that are treading out the corn. He was introduced into the Sekhet Heteput (a section of the
Sekhet Aaru, <i>i.e.</i>, "Field of Reeds," or the "Elysian Fields") by Thoth, and there he found the souls of his ancestors, who were joined to the
Company of the Gods. One corner of this region was specially set apart for the dwelling place of the <i>aakhu</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, beautified souls, or spirit-souls, who were said to be seven cubits in height, and to reap wheat or barley which grew to a height of
three cubits. Near this spot were moored two boats that were always ready for the use of the denizens of that region; they
appear to have been "spirit boats," <i>i.e.</i>, boats which moved of themselves and carried the beautified wheresoever they wanted to go without any trouble or fatigue on their part.

<p class="figureHead">The Elysian Fields of the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="d0e778">[From the Papyrus of Ani, Brit. Mus., Pap. No. 10470.]</p>
</div>
<p id="d0e783">How the beautified passed their time in the Kingdom of Osiris may be seen from the pictures cut on the alabaster sarcophagus of Seti I, now
preserved in Sir John Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Here we see them occupied in producing the celestial food on
which they and the god lived. Some are tending the wheat plants as they grow, and others are reaping the ripe grain. In the
texts that accompany these scenes the ears of wheat are said to be the "members of Osiris," and the wheat plant is called
the <i>ma&#257;t</i> plant. Osiris was the Wheat-god and also the personification of <i>Ma&#257;t</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Truth), and the beautified lived upon the body of their god and ate him daily, and the substance of him was the "Bread of Everlastingness," which is
mentioned in the Pyramid Texts. The beautified are described as "Those who have offered up incense to the gods, and whose <i>kau</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, doubles, or persons) have been washed clean. They have been reckoned up and they are <i>ma&#257;t</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Truth) in the presence of the Great God who destroyeth sin." <span id="d0e815" class="pageno">page 32</span>Osiris says to them, "Ye are truth of truth; rest in peace." And of them he says, "They were doers of truth whilst they were
upon earth, they did battle for their god, and they shall be called to the enjoyment of the Land of the House of Life with
<span id="d0e817" class="pageno">page 33</span>Truth. Their truth shall be reckoned to them in the presence of the Great God who destroyeth sin." Then addressing them again
Osiris says, "Ye are beings of Truth, O ye Truths. Take ye your rest because of what ye have done, becoming even as those
who are in my following, and who direct the House of Him whose Soul is holy. Ye shall live there even as they live, and ye
shall have dominion over the cool waters of your land. I command that ye have your being to the limit [of that land] with
Truth and without sin." In these passages we have the two conceptions of Osiris well illustrated. As the Wheat-god he would
satisfy those who wished for a purely material, agricultural heaven, where hunger would be unknown and where the blessed would
be able to satisfy every physical desire and want daily; and as the God of Truth, of whom the spiritually minded hoped to
become the counterpart, he would be their hope, and consolation, and the image of the Eternal God.
</p>
<h1 id="d0e821">A Short Description of the "Doors" or Chapters of the Book of the Dead.</h1>
<p id="d0e826">All the great papyri of the Book of the Dead begin with a HYMN TO R&#256;, who from the period of the IVth dynasty was the "King
of the Gods" of Egypt. His cult was finally "established" under the Vth dynasty when the king of Egypt began to call himself
in official documents and monuments "Son of the Sun," <img src="img/hg3301.png" alt="">
<i>Sa R&#257;</i>. This Hymn is supposed to be sung by the deceased, who says:&#8212;
"Homage to thee, O R&#257;, at thy beauteous rising. Thou risest, thou risest; thou shinest, thou shinest at the dawn. Thou art
King of the Gods, and the Ma&#257;ti goddesses embrace thee. The Company of the Gods praise thee at sunrise and at sunset. Thou
sailest over the heights of heaven and thy heart is glad. Thy Morning Boat meeteth thy Evening Boat with fair winds. Thy father
is the Sky-god and thy mother is the Sky-goddess, and thou art Horus of the Eastern and Western skies. ... O thou Only One,
O thou Perfect One, O thou who art eternal, who art never weak, whom no mighty one can abase; none hath dominion over the
things which appertain to thee. Homage to thee in thy characters of Horus, Tem, and Khepera, thou Great Hawk, who makest man
to rejoice by thy beautiful face. When thou risest men and women live. Thou renewest thy youth, and dost <span id="d0e835" class="pageno">page 34</span>set thyself in the place where thou wast yesterday. O Divine Youth, who art self-created, I cannot comprehend thee. Thou art
the lord of heaven and earth, and didst create beings celestial and beings terrestrial. Thou art the God One, who camest into
being in the beginning of time. Thou didst create the earth, and man, thou didst make the sky and the celestial river Hep;
thou didst make the waters and didst give life unto all that therein is. Thou hast knit together the mountains, thou hast
made mankind and the beasts of the field to come into being, and hast made the heavens and the earth. The fiend Nak is overthrown,
his arms are cut off. O thou Divine Youth, thou heir of everlastingness, self-begotten and self-born, One, Might, of myriad
forms and aspects, Prince of An (<i>i.e.</i>, On), Lord of Eternity, Everlasting Ruler, the Company of the Gods rejoice in thee. As thou risest thou growest greater:
thy rays are upon all faces. Thou art unknowable, and no tongue can describe thy similitude; thou existest alone. Millions
of years have passed over the world, I cannot tell the number of those through which thou hast passed. Thou journeyest through
spaces [requiring] millions of years [to pass over] in one little moment of time, and then thou settest and dost make an end
of the hours."
</p>
<p id="d0e842">The subject matter of the above extract is treated at greater length in Chapter XV, which contains a long Hymn to R&#257; at his
rising, or Amen-R&#257;, or R&#257; united to other solar gods, <i>e.g.</i>, Horus and Khepera, and a short Hymn to R&#257; at his setting. In the latter the welcome which R&#257; receives from the dwellers
in Amentt (<i>i.e.</i>, the Hidden Place, like the Greek "Hades") is emphasized thus:&#8212;
</p>
<p id="d0e851">"All the beautified dead (Aakhu) in the Tuat receive him in the horizon of Amentt. They shout praises of him in his form of Tem (<i>i.e.</i>, the setting sun). Thou didst rise and put on strength, and thou settest, a living being, and thy glories are in Amentt.
The gods of Amentt rejoice in thy beauties (or beneficence). The hidden ones worship thee, the aged ones bring thee offerings
and protect thee. The Souls of Amentt cry out, and when they meet thy Majesty (Life, Strength, Health be to thee!) they shout
'Hail! Hail!' The lords of the mansions of the Tuat stretch out their hands to thee from their abodes, and they cry to thee,
and they follow in thy bright train, and the hearts of the lords of the Tuat rejoice when thou sendest thy light into Amentt.
Their eyes follow thee, they press forward to see thee, and their hearts rejoice at the sight of thy face. Thou hearkenest
to the petitions of those who are in their tombs, thou dispellest their helplessness and drivest away evil from them. Thou
givest breath to their nostrils. Thou art greatly feared, thy form is majestic, and very greatly art thou beloved by those
who dwell in the Other World."
<span id="d0e859" class="pageno">page 35</span>
The Introductory HYMN TO R&#256; is followed by a HYMN TO OSIRIS, in which the deceased says:&#8212;
<p id="d0e863">"Glory be to thee, O Osiris Un-Nefer, thou great god in Abtu (Abydos), King of Eternity, Lord of Everlastingness, God whose
existence is millions of years, eldest son of Nut, begotten by Geb, the Ancestor-Chief, Lord of the Crowns of the South and
the North, Lord of the High White Crown. Thou art the Governor of gods and of men and hast received the sceptre, the whip,
and the rank of thy Divine Fathers. Let thy heart in Amentt be content, for thy son Horus is seated upon thy throne. Thou
art Lord of Tetu (Busiris) and Governor of Abtu (Abydos). Thou makest fertile the Two Lands (<i>i.e</i>., all Egypt) by [thy] true word before the Lord to the Uttermost Limit.... Thy power is widespread, and great is the terror
of thy name 'Osiris.' Thou endurest for all eternity in thy name of 'Un-Nefer' (<i>i.e.</i>, Beneficent Being). Homage to thee, King of kings, Lord of lords, Governor of governors, who from the womb of the Sky-goddess
hast ruled the World and the Under World. Thy limbs are as silver-gold, thy hand is blue like lapis-lazuli, and the space
on either side of thee is of the colour of turquoise (or emerald). Thou god An of millions of years, thy body is all-pervading,
O dweller in the Land of Holiness, thy face is beautiful ... The gods come before thee bowing low. They hold thee in fear.
They withdraw and retreat when they see the awfulness of R&#257; upon thee; the [thought] of the conquests of thy Majesty is in
their hearts. Life is with thee.
</p>
<p id="d0e872">"Let me follow thy Majesty as when I was on earth, let my soul be summoned, and let it be found near the Lords of Truth. I
have come to the City of God, the region that is eternally old, with my soul (<i>ba</i>), double (<i>ka</i>) and spirit-soul (<i>aakhu</i>), to be a dweller in this land. Its God is the Lord of Truth ... he giveth old age to him that worketh Truth, and honour
to his followers, and at the last abundant equipment for the tomb, and burial in the Land of Holiness. I have come unto thee,
my hands hold Truth, and there is no falsehood in my heart ... Thou hast set Truth before thee: I know on what thou livest.
I have committed no sin in this land, and I have defrauded no man of his possessions." (Chapter CLXXXIII.)
</p>
<p id="d0e886">Chapter I was recited by the priest who accompanied the mummy to the tomb and performed the burial ceremonies there. In it
the priest (<i>kher heb</i>) assumed the character of Thoth and promised the deceased to do for him all that he had done for Osiris in days of old. Chapter
IB gave the <i>s&#257;hu</i>, or "spirit-body," power to enter the Tuat immediately after the burial of the material body, and delivered it from the Nine
Worms that lived on the dead. Chapters II&#8211;IV are short spells written to give the deceased power to revisit the earth, to
join the gods, and to travel about the sky. Chapters V and VI provided <span id="d0e894" class="pageno">page 36</span>for the performance of agricultural labours in the Other World. The text of Chapter VI was cut on figures made of stone, wood,
etc. (<i>ushabtiu</i>), which were placed in the tomb, and when the deceased recited it these figures became alive and did everything he wished.
The <i>shabti</i> figure, <img src="img/hg3601.png" alt="">, took the place of the human funerary sacrifice which was common all over Egypt before the general adoption of the cult of
Osiris under the XIIth dynasty. About 700 <i>ushabtiu</i> figures were found in the tomb of Seti I, and many of them are in the British Museum. Chapter VII is a spell to destroy the
Great Serpent &#256;apep, <img src="img/hg3602.png" alt="">, the Arch-enemy of Horus the Elder, R&#257;, Osiris, Horus son of Isis, and of every follower of Osiris. Chapters VIII and IX
secured a passage for the deceased through the Tuat, and Chapters X and XI gave him power over the enemies he met there. Chapters
XII and XIII gave him great freedom of movement in the Kingdom of Osiris. Chapter XIV is a prayer in which Osiris is entreated
to put away any feeling of dissatisfaction that he may have for the deceased, who says, "Wash away my sins, Lord of Truth;
destroy my transgressions, wickedness and iniquity, O God of Truth. May this god be at peace with me. Destroy the things that
are obstacles between us. Give me peace, and remove all dissatisfaction from thy heart in respect of me."

<p id="d0e940">Chapter XV has several forms, and each of them contains Hymns to R&#257;, which were sung daily in the morning and <span id="d0e942" class="pageno">page 37</span>evening; specimen paragraphs are given above (pp. 33, 34). Chapter XVI is only a vignette that illustrates Chapter XV, Chapter
XVII is a very important chapter, for it contains statements of divine doctrine as understood by the priests of Heliopolis.
The opening words are, "I am Tem in rising. I am the Only One. I came into being in Nu (the Sky). I am R&#257;, who rose in primeval
time, ruler of what he had made." Following this comes the question, "Who is this?" and the answer is, "It is R&#257; who rose
in the city of Hensu, in primeval time, crowned as king. He existed on the height of the Dweller in Khemenu (<i>i.e.</i>, Thoth of Hermopolis) before the pillars that support the sky were made." Chapter XVIII contains the Addresses to Thoth,
who is entreated to make the deceased to be declared innocent before the gods of Heliopolis, Busiris, Latopolis, Mendes, Abydos,
etc. These addresses formed a very powerful spell which was used by Horus, and when he recited it four times all his enemies
were overthrown and cut to pieces. Chapters XIX and XX are variant forms of Chapter XVIII. Chapters XXI&#8211;XXIII secured the
help of Thoth in "opening the mouth" of the deceased, whereby he obtained the power to breathe and think and drink and eat.
Thoth recited spells over the gods whilst Ptah untied the bandages and Shu forced open their mouths with an iron (?) knife.
Chapter XXIV gave to the deceased a knowledge of the "words of power" (<img src="img/hg3701.png" alt="">, <i>hekau</i>) which were used by the great god Tem-Khepera, and Chapter XXV restored to him his memory. Five chapters, XXVI&#8211;XXX, contain
prayers and spells whereby the deceased <span id="d0e952" class="pageno">page 38</span>obtained power over his heart and gained absolute possession of it. The most popular prayer is that of Chapter XXXB (see above,
<a href="#d0e189">p. 4</a>) which, according to its rubric, was "found," <i>i.e.</i>, edited, by Herutataf, the son of the great Cheops, about 3600 B.C. This prayer was still in use in the early years of the
Christian Era. In the Papyrus of Nu it is associated with Chapter LXIV, and the earliest form of it was probably in existence
under the Ist dynasty.
</p>
<p id="d0e961">Chapters XXXI&#8211;XLII were written to deliver the deceased from the Great Crocodile Sui, and the Serpents Rerek and Seksek, and
the Lynx with its deadly claws, and the Beetle &#256;pshait, and the terrible Merti snake-goddesses, and a group of three particularly
venomous serpents, and &#256;apep a personification of Set the god of evil, and the Eater of the Ass, and a series of beings who
lived by slaughtering the souls of the dead. In Chapter XLII every member of the deceased is put under the protection of,
or identified with, a god or goddess, <i>e.g.</i>, the hair with Nu, the face with Aten (<i>i.e.</i>, the solar disk), the eyes with Hathor, and the deceased exclaims triumphantly, "There is no member of my body which is not
the member of a god." Chapter XLIII. A spell to prevent the decapitation of the deceased, who assumes in it the character
of Osiris the Lord of Eternity. Chapter XLIV. An ancient and mighty spell, the recital of which prevented the deceased from
dying a second time. Chapters XLV and XLVI preserved the mummy of the deceased from decay, and Chapter XLVII prevented the
removal of his seat or throne. Chapter L enabled the deceased to avoid the block of execution of the god Shesmu. Chapters
LI&#8211;LIII provided the deceased with pure food and clean water from the table of the gods; he lived upon what they lived upon,
and so became one with them. Chapters LIV&#8211;LXII gave the deceased power to obtain cool water from the Celestial Nile and the
springs of waters of heaven, and being identified with Shu, the god of light and air, he was enabled to pass over all the
earth at will. His life was that of the Egg of the "Great Cackler," and the goddess Sesheta built a house for him in the Celestial
Anu, or Heliopolis.

</div>
<p id="d0e979">The recital of Chapter LXIII enabled the deceased to avoid drinking boiling water in the Tuat. The water in some of its pools
was cool and refreshing to those who were speakers of the <span id="d0e981" class="pageno">page 39</span>truth, but it turned into boiling water and scalded the wicked when they tried to drink of it. Chapter LXIV is an epitome
of the whole Book of the Dead, and it formed a "great and divine protection" for the deceased. The text is of a mystical character
and suggests that the deceased could, through its recital, either absorb the gods into his being, or become himself absorbed
by them. Its rubric orders abstention from meats, fish and women on the part of those who were to recite it. Chapter LXV gave
the deceased victory over all his enemies, and Chapters LXVI and LXVII gave him access to the Boat of R&#257;. Chapters LXVIII&#8211;LXX
procured him complete freedom of motion in heaven and on earth. Chapter LXXI is a series of addresses to the Seven Spirits
who punished the wicked in the Kingdom of Osiris, and Chapter LXXII aided the deceased to be reborn in the Mesqet Chamber.
The Mesqet was originally a bull's skin in which the deceased was wrapped. Chapter LXXIII is the same as Chapter IX. Chapters
LXXIV and LXXV secured a passage for the deceased in the Henu Boat of Seker the Death-god, and Chapter LXXVI brought to his
help the praying mantis which guided him through the "bush" to the House of Osiris. By the recital of Chapters LXXVII&#8211;LXXXVIII,
<i>i.e</i>., the "Chapters of Transformations," the deceased was enabled to assume at will the forms of (1) the Golden Hawk, (2) the
Divine Hawk, (3) the Great Self-created God, (4) the Light-god or the Robe of Nu, (5) the Pure Lily, (6) the Son of Ptah,
(7) the Benu Bird, (8) the Heron, (9) the Soul of R&#257;, (10) the Swallow, (11) the Sata or Earth-serpent, (12) the Crocodile.
Chapter LXXXIX brought the soul (<i>ba</i>) <span id="d0e989" class="pageno">page 40</span>of the deceased to his body in the Tuat, and Chapter XC preserved him from mutilation and attacks of the god who "cut off
heads and slit foreheads." Chapters XCI and XCII prevented the soul of the deceased from being shut in the tomb. Chapter XCIII
is a spell very difficult to understand. Chapters XCIV and XCV provided the deceased with the books of Thoth and the power
of this god, and enabled him to take his place as the scribe of Osiris. Chapters XCVI and XCVII also placed him under the
protection of Thoth. The recital of Chapter XCVIII provided the deceased with a boat in which to sail over the northern heavens,
and a ladder by which to ascend to heaven. Chapters XCIX&#8211;CIII gave him the use of the magical boat, the mystic name of each
part of which he was obliged to know, and helped him to enter the Boat of R&#257; and to be with Hathor. The Bebait, or mantis,
led him to the great gods (Chapter CIV), and the Uatch amulet from the neck of R&#257; provided his double (<i>ka</i>) and his heart-soul (<i>ba</i>) with offerings (Chapters CV, CVI). Chapters CVII&#8211;CIX made him favourably known to the spirits of the East and West, and
the gods of the Mountain of Sunrise. In this region lived the terrible Serpent-god Ami-hem-f; he was 30 cubits (50 feet) long.
In the East the deceased saw the Morning Star, and the Two Sycamores, from between which the Sun-god appeared daily, and found
the entrance to the Sekhet Aaru or Elysian Fields. Chapter CX and its vignette of the Elysian Fields have already been described
(see <a href="#d0e747">p. 31</a>). Chapters CXI and CXII describe how Horus lost the sight of his eye temporarily through looking at Set under the form of
a black pig, and Chapter CXIII refers to the legend of the drowning of Horus and the recovery of his body by Sebek the Crocodile-god.
Chapter CXIV enabled the deceased to absorb the wisdom of Thoth and his Eight gods. Chapters CXV&#8211;CXXII made him lord of the
Tuats of Memphis and Heliopolis, and supplied him with food, and Chapter CXXIII enabled him to identify himself with Thoth.
Chapters CXXIV and CXXV, which treat of the Judgment, have already been described. Chapter CXXVI contains a prayer to the
Four Holy Apes, Chapter CXXVII a hymn to the gods of the "Circles" in the Tuat, and Chapter CXXVIII a hymn to Osiris. Chapters
CXXX and CXXXI secured for the deceased the use of the Boats of Sunrise and Sunset, and Chapter CXXXII enabled him to return
to earth <span id="d0e1000" class="pageno">page 41</span>and visit the house he had lived in. Chapters CXXXIII (or CXXXIX)&#8211;CXXXVI resemble in contents Chapter CXXXI. Chapter CXXXVII
describes a series of magical ceremonies that were to be performed for the deceased daily in order to make him to become a
"living soul for ever." The formulae are said to have been composed under the IVth dynasty. Chapter CXXXVIII refers to the
ceremony of reconstituting Osiris, and Chapters CXL&#8211;CXLII deal with the setting up of twelve altars, and the making of offerings
to all the gods and to the various forms of Osiris. Chapter CXLIII consists of a series of vignettes, in three of which solar
boats are represented.
</p>
<p id="d0e1003">Chapters CXLIV and CXLVII deal with the Seven Great Halls (<i>&#256;rit</i>) of the Kingdom of Osiris. The gate of each Hall was guarded by a porter, a watchman, and a messenger; the first kept the
door, the second looked out for the arrival of visitors, and the third took their names to Osiris. No one could enter a Hall
without repeating the name of it, of the porter, of the watchman, and of the messenger. According to a late tradition the
Gates of the Kingdom of Osiris were twenty-one in number (Chapters CXLV and CXLVI), and each had a magical name, and each
was guarded by one or two gods, whose names had to be repeated by the deceased before he could pass. Chapter CXLVIII supplied
the deceased with the names of the Seven Cows and their Bull on which the "gods" were supposed to feed. Chapters CXLIX and
CL give the names of the Fourteen Aats, or districts, of the Kingdom of Osiris. Chapter *CLI-A and *CLI-B give a picture of
the mummy chamber and the magical texts that were necessary for the protection of both the chamber and the mummy in it. Chapter
CLII provided a house for the deceased in the Celestial Anu, and Chapter *CLIII-A and *CLIII-B enabled his soul to avoid capture
in the net of the snarer of souls. Chapter CLIV is an address to Osiris in which the deceased says, "I shall not decay, nor
rot, nor putrefy, nor become worms, nor see corruption. I shall have my being, I shall live, I shall flourish, I shall rise
up in peace." Chapters CLV&#8211;CLXVII are spells which were engraved on the amulets <img src="img/hg4101.png" alt="">, <img src="img/hg4102.png" alt="">, <img src="img/hg4103.png" alt="">, <img src="img/hg4104.png" alt="">, <img src="img/hg4105.png" alt="">, <img src="img/hg4106.png" alt="">, etc., giving the deceased the protection of R&#257;, Osiris, Isis, Horus, and other gods. The remaining Chapters (CLXVIII&#8211;CXC)
are of a miscellaneous character, and <span id="d0e1020" class="pageno">page 42</span>few of them are found in more than one or two papyri of the Book of the Dead. A few contain hymns that are not older than
the XVIIIth dynasty, and one is an extract from the text on the Pyramid of Unas (lines 379&#8211;399). The most interesting is,
perhaps, Chapter CLXXV, which describes the Tuat as airless, waterless, and lightless. In this chapter the deceased is assured
of immortality in the words, "Thou shalt live for millions of millions of years, a life of millions of years."

End of Project Gutenberg's The Book of the Dead, by E. A. Wallis Budge

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOOK OF THE DEAD ***

This file should be named 8bkdd10h.htm or 8bkdd10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8bkdd11.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged

codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
