<p>VISITS TO NOTABLE PLACES.</center>

<p><br>
<p>It is a perfect sight to behold, to set on the piazzas at Saratoga,
and see the folks a goin' past.
<p>Now in Jonesville, when there wuz a 4th of July, or campmeetin', or
sunthin' of that kind a goin' on, why, I thought I had seen the streets
pretty full. Why, I had counted as many as seven teams in the road
at one time, and I had thought that wuz pretty lively times. But
good land? Good land! You would have gin up in ten minutes
time here, that you had never seen a team (as it were).
<p>Why I call my head a pretty sound one, but I declare, it did fairly
make my head swim to set there kinder late in the afternoon, and see the
drivin' a goin' on. See the carriages a goin' this way, and a goin'
that way; horses of all colers, and men and wimmen of all colers, and parasols
of all colers, and hats, and bonnets and parasols, and satins, and laces,
and ribbins, and buttons, and dogs, and flowers, and plumes, and parasols.
And horses a turnin' out to go by, and horses havin' gone by, and horses
that hadn't gone by. And big carriages with folks inside all dressed
up in every coler of the rain beaux. And elligent gentlemen dressed
perfectly splendid, a settin' up straight behind. With thin yellow
legs, or stripes down the side on 'em, and their hats all trimmed off with
ornaments and buttons up and down their backs.
<p>Haughty creeters they wuz, I make no doubt. They showed it in
their looks. But I never loved so much dress in a man. And
I would jest as soon have told them so; as to tell you. I hain't
one to say things to a man's back that I won't say to his face, whether
it be a plain back or buttoned.
<p>Wall, as I say, it wuz a dizzy sight to set there on them piazzas and
see the seemin'ly endless crowd a goin' by; back and forth, back and forth;
to and fro, to and fro. I didn't enjoy it so much as some did, though
for a few minutes at a time I looked upon it as a sort of a recreation,
some like a circus, only more wilder.
<p>But some folks enjoyed it dretfully. Yes, they set a great deal
on piazzas at Saratoga. And when I say set on 'em, I mean they set
a great store on 'em, and they set on 'em a great deal. Some folks
set on 'em so much, that I called them setters. Real likely creeters
they are too, some on 'em, and handsome; some pious, sober ones,
some sort a gay. Some not married at all, and some married a good
deal, and when I say a good deal I meen, they have had various companions
and lost 'em.
<p>Now there wuz one woman that I liked quite well.
<p>She had had 4 husbands countin' in the present one. She wuz a
good lookin' woman and had seen trouble. It stands to reeson she
had with 4 husbands. Good land!
<p>She showed me one day a ring she wore. She had took the weddin'
rings of her 4 pardners and had 'em all run together, and the initials
of their first names carved inside on it. Her first husband's name
wuz Franklin, her next two wuz Orville and Obed, and her last and livin'
one Lyman. Wall, she meant well, but she never see what would be
the end on't and how it would read till she had got their initials all
carved out on it.
<p>She wuz dretfully worked up about it, but I see that it wuz right.
For nobody but a fool would want to run all these recollections and memories
together, all the different essociations and emotions, that must cluster
round each of them rings. The idee of runnin' 'em all together with
the livin' one! It wuz ectin' like a fool and it seemed fairly providential
that their names run in jest that way.
<p>Why, if I had had 2 husbands, or even 4, I should want to keep 'em apart
- settin' up in high chairs on different sides of my heart. Why,
if I'd had 4, I'd have 'em to the different pints of the compass, east,
west, north, south, as far apart from each other as my heart would admit
of. Ketch me a lumpin' in all the precious memories of my Josiah
with them of any other man, bond or free, Jew or Genteel; no, and I'd refrain
from tellin' to the new one about the other ones.
<p>No, when a pardner dies and you set out to take another one, bury the
one that has gone right under his own high chair in your heart, don't keep
him up there a rattlin' his bones before the eyes of the 2d, and angerin'
him, and agonizen' your own heart. Bury him before you bring a new
one into the same room.
<p>And never! never! even in moments of the greatest anger, dig him up
agin or even weep over his grave, before the new pardner. No; under
the moonlight, and the stars, before God only, and your own soul, you may
lay there in spirit on that grave, weep over it, keep the turf green.
But not before any one else. And I wouldn't advise you to go there
alone any too often. I would advise you to spend your spare time
ornementin' the high chair where the new one sets, wreathin' it round with
whatever blossoms and trailin' vines of tenderness and romance you have
left over from the first great romance of life.
<p>It would be better for you in the end.
<p>I said some few of these little thoughts to the female mentioned; and
I s'pose I impressed her dretfully, I s'pose I did. But I couldn't
stay to see the full effects on't, for another female setter came up at
that minute to talk with her, and my companion came up at that very minute
to ask me to go a walkin' with him up to the cemetery.
<p>That is a very favorite place for Josiah Allen. He often used
to tell the children when they wuz little, that if they wuz real good he
would take 'em out on a walk to the grave-yard.
<p>And when I first married to him, if I hadn't broke it up, that would
have been the only place of resort that he would have took me to Summers.
But I broke it up after a while. Good land! there is times to go
any where and times to stay away. I didn't
<br>want to go a trailin' up there every day or two; jest married too!
<p>But to-day I felt willin' to go. I had been a lookin' so long
at the crowd a fillin' the streets full, and every one on 'em in motion,
that I thought it would be sort a restful to go out to a place where they
wuz still. And so after a short walk we came to the village that
haint stirred by any commotion or alarm. Where the houses are roofed
with green grass and daisies, and the white stun doors don't open to let
in trouble or joy, and where the inhabitants don't ride out in the afternoon.
<p>Wall, if I should tell the truth which I am fur from not wantin' to
do, I should say that at first sight, it wuz rather of a bleak, lonesome
lookin' spot, kinder wild and desolate lookin'. But as we went further
along in it, we came to some little nooks and sheltered paths and spots,
that seemed more collected together and pleasant. There wuz some
big high stuns and monuments, and some little ones but not one so low that
it hadn't cast a high, dark shadow over somebody's life.
<p>There wuz one in the shape of a big see shell. I s'pose some mariner
lay under that, who loved the sea. Or mebby it wuz put up by some
one who had the odd fancy that put a shell to your ear you will hear a
whisperin' in it of a land fur away, fur away. Not fur from this
wuz a stun put up over a young engineer who had been killed instantly by
his engine. There wuz a picture of the locomotive scraped out on
the stun, and in the cab of the engine wuz his photograph, and these lines
wuz underneath:
<center>
<p> My engine now lies still and cold,
<br> No water does her boiler hold;
<br>
The wood supplies its flames no more,
<br> My days of usefulness are o'er.</center>

<p>We wended our way in and out of the silent streets for quite a spell,
and then we went and sot down on the broad piazza of the sort of chapel
and green-house that stood not fur from the entrance. And while we
sot there we see another inhabitent come there to the village to stay.
<p>It wuz a long procession, fur it wuz a good man who had come.
And many of his friends come with him jest as fur as they could: wife,
children, and friends, they come with him jest as fur as they could, and
then he had to leave 'em and go on alone. How weak love is, and how
strong. It wuz too weak to hold him back, or go with him, though
they would fain have done so. But it wuz strong enough to shadow
the hull world with its blackness, blot out the sun and the stars, and
scale the very mounts of heaven with its wild complaints and pleadin's.
A strange thing love is, haint it?
<p>Wall, we sot there for quite a spell and my companion wantin', I spose,
to make me happy, took out a daily paper out of his pocket and went to
readin' the deaths to me. He always loves to read the deaths and
marriages in a paper. He sez that is the literature that interests
him. And then I s'pose he thought at such a time, it wuz highly appropriate.
So I didn't break it up till he began to read a long obituary piece about
a child's death; about its being cut down like a flower by a lightin' stroke
out of a cloudless sky, and about what a mysterious dispensation of Providence
it wuz, etc., etc. And then there wuz a hull string of poetry dedicated
to the heart-broken mother bewailin' the mystery on't, and wonderin' why
Providence should do such strange, onlookedfor things, etc., and etcetery,
and so 4th.
<p>And I spoke right up and sez, "That is a slander onto Providence and
ort to be took as such by every lover of justice."
<p>Josiah wuz real horrified, he had been almost sheddin' tears he wuz
so affected by it; to think the little creeter should be torn away by a
strange chance of Providence from a mother who worshipped her, and whose
whole life and every thought wuz jest wrapped up in the child, and who
never had thought nor cared for anything else only just the well bein'
of the child and wardin' trouble off of her, for so the piece stated.
And he sez in wild amaze, "What do you mean, Samantha? What makes
you talk so?"
<p>"Because," sez I, "I know it is the truth. I know the hull story;"
and then I went on and told it to him, and he agreed with me and felt jest
as I did.
<p>You see, the mother of the child wuz a perfect high flyer of fashion
and she always wore dresses so tight, that she couldn't get her hands up
to her head to save her life, after her corset wuz on. Wall, she
wuz out a walkin' with the child one day, or rather toddlin' along with
it, on her high-heeled sboes. They wuz both dressed up perfectly
beautiful, and made a most splendid show. Wall, they went into a
store on their way to the park, and there wuz a big crowd there, and the
mother and the little girl got into the very middle of the crowd.
They say there wuz some new storks for sale that day, and some cattail
flags, and so there wuz naturelly a big crowd of wimmen a buyin' 'em, and
cranes. And some way, while they stood there a heavy vase that stood
up over the child's head fell down and fell onto it, and hurt the child
so, that it died from the effects of it.
<p>The mother see the vase when it flrst begun to move, she could have
reached up her hands and stiddied it, and kep' it from fallin', if she
could have got 'em up, but with that corset on, the hull American continent
might have tumbled onto the child's head and she couldn't have moved her
arms up to keep it off; couldn't have lifted her arms up over the child's
head to save her life. No, she couldn't have kep' one of the States
off, nor nothin'. And then talk about her wardin' trouble offen the
child, why she couldn't ward trouble off, nor nothin' else with that corset
on. She screemed, as she see it a comin' down onto the head of her
beloved little child, but that wuz all she could do. The child wuz
wedged in by the throng of folks and couldn't stir, and they wuz all engrossed
in their own business which wuz pressin', and very important, a buyin'
plates, and plaks, with bull-rushes, and cranes, and storks on 'em, so
naturelly, they didn't mind what wuz a goin' on round 'em. And down
it come!
<p>And there it wuz put down in the paper, "A mysterious dispensation of
Providence." Providence slandered shamefully and I will say so with
my last breath.
<p>What are mothers made for if it haint to take care of the little ones
God gives 'em. What right have they to contoggle themselves up in
a way that they can see their children die before 'em, and they not able
to put out a hand to save 'em. Why, a savage mother is better than
this, a heathen one. And if I had my way, there would be a hull shipload
of savages and heathens brought over here to teach and reform our too civilized
wimmen. I'd bring 'em over this very summer.
<p>Wall, we sot there on the stoop for quite a spell and then we wended
our way down to the highway, and as we arrived there my companion proposed
that we should take a carriage and go to the Toboggen slide. Sez
I, "Not after where we have been today, Josiah Allen."
<p>And he sez, "Why not?"
<p>And I sez, "It wouldn't look well, after visitin' the folks we have
jest now."
<p>"Wall," sez he, "they won't speak on't to anybody, if that is what you
are afraid on, or sense it themselves."
<p>And I see in a minute, he had some sense on his side, though his words
shocked me some at first, kinder jarred aginst some sensitive spot in my
nater, jest as pardners will sometimes, however devoted they may be to
each other. Yet I see he wuz in the right on't.
<p>They wouldn't sense anything about it. And as for us, we wuz in
the world of the livin' still, and I still owed a livin' duty to my companion,
to make him as happy as possible. And so I sez, mildly, "Wall, I
don't know as there is anything wrong in slidin' down hill, Josiah.
I s'pose I can go with you."
<p>"No," sez he, "there haint nothin' wrong about slidin' down hill unless
you strike too hard, or tip over, or sunthin'." So he bagoned to
a carriage that wuz passin', and we got into it, and sot sail for the Toboggen
slide.
<p>We passed through the village. (Some say it is a city, but if
it is, it is a modest, retirin' one as I ever see; perfectly unassumin',
and don't put on a air, not one.)
<p>But howsumever, we passed through it, through the rows and rows of summer
tarvens and boardin' houses, good-lookin' ones too; past some good-lookin'
private houses -- a long tarven and a pretty red brick studio and rows
of summer stores, little nests that are filled up summers, and empty winters,
then by some more of them monster big tarvens where some of the 200,000
summer visitors who flock here summers, find a restin' place; and then
by the large respectable good-lookin' stores and shops of the natives,
that stand solid, and to be depended on summer and winter; by churches
and halls, and etc., and good-lookin' houses and then some splendid-lookin'
houses all standin' back on their grassy lawns behind some trees, and fountains,
and flower beds, etc., etc.
<p>Better-lookin' houses, I don't want to see nor broader, handsomer streets.
And pretty soon fur away to the east you could see through the trees a
glimpse of a glorious landscape, a broad lovely view of hill and valley,
bounded by blue mountain tops. It was a fair seen - a fair seen.
To be perfectly surrounded by beauty where you, wuz, and a lookin' off
onto more. There I would fain have lingered, but time and wagons
roll stidily onward, and will not brook delay, nor pause for women to soar
over seenery.
<p>So we rolled onwards through still more beautiful, and quiet pictures.
Pictures of quiet woods and bendin' trees, and a country road windin' tranquilly
beneath, up and down gentle hills, and anon a longer one, and then at our
feet stood the white walls of a convent, with 2 or 3 brothers, a strollin'
along in their long black gowns, and crosses, a readin' some books.
<p>I don't know what it wuz, what they wuz a readin' out of their books,
or a readin' out of their hearts. Mebby sunthin' kinder sad and serene.
Mebby it wuz sunthin' about the gay world of human happiness, and human
sorrows, they had turned backs to forever. Mebby it wuz about the
other world that they had sot out for through a lonesome way. Mebby
it wuz "Never" they wuz a readin' about, and mebby it wuz "Forever."
I don't know what it wuz. But we went by 'em, and anon, yes it wuz
jest anon, for it wuz the very minute that I lifted my eyes from the Father's
calm and rather sad-lookin' face, that I ketched sight on't, that I see
a comin' down from the high hills to the left on us, an immense sort of
a trough, or so it looked, a comin' right down through the trees, from
the top of the mountain to the, bottom. And then all acrost the fields
as fur, as fur as from our house way over to Miss Pixley's wuz a sort of
a road, with a row of electric lights along the side on't.
<p>We drove up to a buildin' that stood at the foot of that immense slide,
or so they called it, and a female woman who wuz there told us all about
it. And we went out her back door, and see way up the slide, or trough.
There wuz a railin' on each side on't, and a place in the middle where
she said the Toboggen came down.
<p>And sez Josiah, "Who is the Toboggen, anyway? Is he a native of
the place or a Injun? Anyway," sez he, "I'd give a dollar bill to
see him a comin' down that place."
<p>And the woman said, "A Toboggen wuz a sort of a long sled, that two
or three folks could ride on, and they come down that slide with such force
that they went way out acrost the fields as far as the row of lights, before
it stopped."
<p>Sez I, "Josiah Allen, did you ever see the beat on't?" Sez I,
"Haint that as far as from our house to Miss Pixley's?"
<p>"Yes," says he, "and further too. It is as far as Uncle Jim Hozzleton's."
<p>"Wall," says I, "I believe you are in the right on't."
<p>And sez Josiah, "How do they get back agin? Do they come in the
cars, or in their own conveniences?"
<p>"There is a sleigh to bring 'em back, but sometime they walk back,"
sez the woman.
<p>"Walk back!" sez I, in deep amaze. "Do they walk from way out
there, and cleer up that mountain agin?"
<p>"Yes," sez she. "Don't you see the place at the side for 'em to
draw the Toboggen up, and the little flights of steps for 'em to go up
the hill?"
<p>"Wall," sez I, in deep amaze, and auxins as ever to get information
on deep subjects, "where duz the fun come in, is it in walkin' way over
the plain and up the hills, or is it in comin' down?"
<p>And she said she didn't know exactly where the fun lay, but she s'posed
it wuz comin' down. Anyway, they seemed to enjoy it first rate.
And she said it wuz a pretty sight to see 'em all on a bright clear night,
when the sky wuz blue and full of stars, and the earth white and glistenin'
underneath to see 7 or 800, all dressed up in to gayest way, suits of white
blankets, gay borders and bright tasseled caps of every color, and suits
of every other pretty color all trimmed with fur and embroideries, to see
'em all a laughin' and a talkin', with their cheeks and eyes bright and
glowin', to see 'em a comin' down the slide like flashes of every colored
light, and away out over the white glistenin' plains; and then to see the
long line of happy laughin' creeters a walkin' back agin' drawin' the gay
Toboggens. She said it wuz a sight worth seein'.
<p>"Do they come down alone?" sez Josiah.
<p>"Oh no!" sez she. "Boys and their sweethearts, men and wives,
fathers and mothers and children, sometimes 4 on a Toboggan."
<p>Sez Josiah, lookin' anamated and clever, "I'd love to take you on one
on 'em, Samantha.'
<p>"Oh no!" sez I, "I wouldn't want to be took."
<p>But a bystander a standin' by said it wuz a sight to behold to stand
up on top and start off. He said the swiftness of the motion, the
brightness of the electric lights ahead, the gleam of the snow made it
seem like plungin' down a dazzlin' Niagara of whiteness and glitterin'
light; and some, like bein' shot out of a cannon. Why, he said they
went with such lightnin' speed, that if you stood clost by the slide a
waitin' to see a friend go by, you might stand so near as to touch her,
but you couldn't no more see her to recognize her, than you could recognize
one spoke from another in the wheel of a runaway carriage. You would
jest see a red flash go by, if so be it wuz a red gown she had on.
A red flash a dartin' through the air, and a disappearin' down the long
glitterin' lane of light.
<p>You could see her a goin' back, so they said, a laughin' and a jokin'
with somebody, if so be she walked back, but there wuz long sleighs to
carry 'em back, them and their Toboggens, if they wanted to ride, at the
small expenditure of 10 cents apiece. They go, in the fastest time
anybody can make till they go on the lightnin', a way in which they will
go before long, I think, and Josiah duz too.
<p>"They said there wuzn't nothin' like it. And I said, "Like as
not." I believed 'em. And then the woman said, "This long room
we wuz a standin' in," for we had gone back into the house, durin' our
interview, this long room wuz all warm and light for 'em to come into and
get warm, and she said as many as 600 in a night would come in there and
have supper there.
<p>And then she showed us the model of a Toboggen, all sculped out, with
a man and a woman on it. The girl wuz ahead sort a drawin' the Toboggen,
as you may say, and her lover. (I know he wuz, from his looks.)
He wuz behind her, with his face right clost to her shoulder.
<p>And I'll bet that when they started down that gleamin' slide, they felt
as if they 2 wuz alone under the stars and the heavens, and wuz a glidin'
down into a dazzlin' way of glory. You could see it in their faces.
I liked their faces real well.
<p>But the sight on 'em made Josiah Allen crazier'n ever to go too, and
he sez, "I feel as if I must Toboggen, Samantha!"
<p>Sez I, "Be calm! Josiah, you can't slide down hill in July."
<p>"How do you know?" sez he, "I'm bound to enquire." And he asked
the woman if they ever Toboggened in the summer.
<p>"No, never!" sez she.
<p>And I sez, "You see it can't be done."
<p>"She never see it tried," sez he. "How can you tell what you can
do without tryin'?" sez he lookin' shrewdly, and longingly, up the slide.
I trembled, for I knew not what the next move of his would be. But
I bethought me of a powerful weepon I had by me. And I sez, "The
driver will ask pay for every minute we are here."
<center>
<p><img SRC="ch13/255.gif" height=331 width=213 ALT="Down the Steps"></center>

<p>And as I sez this, Josiah turned and almost flew down the steps and
into the buggy. I had skairt him. Truly I felt relieved, and
sez I to myself, "What would wimmen do if it wuzn't for these little weepons
they hold in their hands, to control their pardners with." I felt
happy.
<p>But the next words of Josiah knocked down all that palace of Peace,
that my soul had betook herself to. Sez he, "Samantha Allen, before
I leave Saratoga I shall Toboggen."
<p>Wall, I immegetly turned the subject round and talked wildly and almost
incoherently on politicks. I praised the tariff amost beyond its
deserts. I brung up our foreign relations, and spoke well on 'em.
I tackled revenues and taxation, and hurried him from one to the other
on 'em, almost wildly, to get the idee out of his head. And I congratulated
myself on havin' succeeded. Alas! how futile is our hopes, sometimes
futiler than we have any idee on!
<p>By night all thoughts of danger had left me, and I slept sweetly and
peacefully. But early in the mornin' I had a strange dream.
I dreamed I wuz in the woods with my head a layin' on a log, and the ground
felt cold that I wuz a layin' on. And then the log gin way with me,
and my head came down onto the ground. And then I slept peaceful
agin, but chilly, till anon, or about that time, I beard a strange sound
and I waked up with a start. It wuz in the first faint glow of mornin'
twilight. But as faint as the light wuz, for the eye of love is keen,
I missed my beloved pardner's head from the opposite pillow, and I riz
up in wild agitation and thinkses I, "Has rapine took place here; has Josiah
Allen been abducted away from me? Is he a kidnapped Josiah?"
<p>At that fearful thought my heart begun to beat so voyalently as to almost
stop my breath, and I felt I wuz growin' pale and wan, wanner, fur wanner
than I had been sense I came to Saratoga. I love Josiah Allen, he
is dear to me.
<p>And I riz up feelin' that I would find that dear man and rescue him
or perish in the attempt. Yes, I felt that I must perish if I did
not find him. What would life be to me without him? And as
I thought that thought the light of the day that wuz a breakin', looked
sort of a faint to me, and sickish. And like a flash it came to me,
the thought that that light seemed like the miserable dawns of wretched
days without him, a pale light with no warmth or brightness in it.
<p>But at that very minute I heard a noise outside the door, and I heard
that beloved voice a sayin' in low axents the words I had so often heard
him speak, words I had oft rebuked him for, but now, so weak will human
love make one, now, I welcome them gladly -- they sounded exquisitely sweet
to me. The words wuz, "Dumb 'em!"
<p>And I joyfully opened the door. But oh! what a sight met my eye.
There stood Josiah Allen, arrayed in a blanket he had took from our bed
(that accounted for my cold feelin' in my dream). The blanket wuz
white, with a gay border of red and yellow. He had fixed it onto
him in a sort of a dressy way, and strapped it round the waist with my
shawl strap. And he had took a bright yeller silk handkerchief of
hisen, and had wrapped it round his head so's it hung down some like a
cap, and he wuz a tryin' to fasten it round his forward with one of my
stockin' supporters. He couldn't buckle it, and that is what called
forth his exclamations. At his feet, partly upon the stairs, wuz
the bolster from our bed (that accounted for the log that had gin way).
And he had spread a little red shawl of mine over the top on't, and as
I opened the door he wuz jest ready to embark on the bolster, he waz jest
a steppin' onto it. But as he see me he paused, and I sez in low
axents, "What are you a goin' to do, Josiah Allen?"
<p>"I'm a goin' to Toboggen," sez he.

<p>Sez I, "Do you stop at once, and come back into your room."
<p>"No, no!" sez he firmly, and preparin' to embark on the bolster, "I
am a goin' to Toboggen. And you come and go to. It is so fashionable,"
sez he, "such a genteel diversion."
<p>Sez I, "Do you stop it at once, and come back to your room. Why,"
sez I, "the hull house will be routed up, and be up here in a minute."
<p>"Wall," sez he, "they'll see fun if they do and fashion. I am
a goin', Samantha!" and be stepped forward.
<p>Sez I, "They'll see sunthin' else that begins with a f, but it haint
fun or fashion.' And agin I sez, "Do you come back, Josiah Allen.
You'll break your neck and rout up the house, and be called a fool."
<p>"Oh no, Samantha! I must Toboggen. I must go down the slide once."
And he fixed the bolster more firmly on the top stair.
<p>"Wall," sez I, feelin' that I wuz drove to my last ambush by him, sez
I, "probably five dollars won't make the expenses good, besides your doctor's
bill, and my mornin'. And I shall put on the deepest of crape, Josiah
Allen," sez I.
<p>I see he wavered and I pressed the charge home. Sez I, "That bolster
is thin cloth, Josiah Allen, and you'll probably have to pay now for draggin'
it all over the floor. If anybody should see you with it there, that
bolster would be charged in your bill. And how would it look to the
neighbors to have a bolster charged in your bill? And I should treasure
it, Josiah Allen, as bein' the last bill you made before you broke your
neck !"
<p>"Oh, wall," sez he, "I s'pose I can put the bolster back." But
he wuz snappish, and he kep' snappish all day.
<p>He wuzn't quelled. Though he had gin in for the time bein' I see
he wuzn't quelled down. He acted dissatisfied and highheaded, and
I felt worried in my mind, not knowin' what his next move would be.
<p>Oh! the tribulations it makes a woman to take care of a man. But
then it pays. After all, in the deepest of my tribulations I feel,
I do the most of the time feel, that it pays. When he is good he
is dretful good.
<p>Wall, I went over to see Polly Pixley the next night, and when I got
back to my room, there stood Josiah Allen with both of his feet sort a
bandaged and tied down onto sumthin', which I didn't at first recognize.
It waz big and sort a egg shaped, and open worked, and both his feet wuz
strapped down tight onto it, and he wuz a pushin' himself round the room
with his umberell.
<p>And I sez, "What is the matter now, Josiah Allen; what are you a doin'
now?"
<p>"Oh I am a walkin' on snow-shoes, Samantha! But I don't see,"
sez he a stoppin' to rest, for he seemed tuckered out, "I don't see how
the savages got round as they did and performed such journeys. You
put 'em on, Samantha," sez he, "and see if you can get on any faster in
'em."
<center>
<p><img SRC="ch13/261.gif" height=325 width=218 ALT="Snowshoes"></center>

<p>Sez I, coldly, "The savages probable did'nt have both feet on one shoe,
Josiah Allen, as you have. I shall put on no snowshoes in the middle
of July; but if I did, I should put 'em on accordin' to a little mite of
sense. I should try to use as much sense as a savage any way."
<p>"Why, how it would look to have one foot on that great big snow-shoe.
I always did like a good close fit in my shoes. And you see I have
room enough and to spare for both on 'em on this. Why it wouldn't
look dressy at all, Samantha, to put 'em on as you say."
<p>Sez I very coldly, "I don't see anything over and above dressy in your
looks now, Josiah Allen, with both of your feet tied down onto that one
shoe, and you a tryin' to move off when you can't. I can't see anything
over and above ornamental in it, Josiah Allen."
<p>"Oh! you are never willin' to give in that I look dressy, Samantha.
But I s'pose I can put my feet where you say. You are so sot, but
they are too big for me -- I shall look like a fool."
<p>I looked at him calmly over my specks, and sez I, "I guess I sha'n't
notice the difference or realize the change. I wonder," sez I, in
middlin' cold axents, "how you think you are a lookin' now, Josiah Allen."
<p>"Oh! keep a naggin' at me!" sez he. But I see he wuz a gittin'
kinder sick of the idee.
<p>"What you mean by puttin' 'em on at all is more than I can say," sez
I, "a tryin to walk on snowshoes right in dog-days."
<p>"I put 'em on," Samantha, sez he, a beginnin' to unstrap 'em, "I put
'em on because I wanted to feel like a savage."
<p>"Wall," sez I, "I have seen you at times durin' the last 20 years, when
I thought you realized how they felt without snow-shoes on, either."
<p>(These little interchanges of confidence will take place in every-day
life.) But at that very minute Ardelia Tutt rapped at the door, and
Josiah hustled them snow-shoes into the closet, and that wuz the last trial
I had with him about 'em. He had borrowed 'em.
<p>Wall, Ardelia wuz dretful pensive, and soft actin' that night, she seemed
real tickled to see us, and to get where we wuz. She haint over and
above suited with the boardin' place where she is, I think. I don't
believe they have very good food, though she won't complain, bein' as they
are relations on her own side. And then she is sech a good little
creeter anyway. But I had my suspicions. She didn't seem very
happy. She said she had been down to the park that afternoon, she
and the young chap that has been a payin' her so much attention lately,
Bial Flamburg. She said they had sot down there by the deer park
most all the afternoon a watchin' the deer. She spoke dretful well
of the deer. And they are likely deer for anything I know.
But she seemed sort a pensive and low spirited. Mebby she is a beginnin'
to find Bial Flamburg out. Mebby she is a beginnin' to not like his
ways. He drinks and smokes, that I know, and I've mistrusted worse
things on him.
