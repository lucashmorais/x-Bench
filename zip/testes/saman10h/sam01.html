<p>SAMANTHA AT SARATOGA.</center>

<p><br>
<p>The idee on't come to me one day about sundown, or a little before sundown.;
I wuz a settin' in calm peace, and a big rockin' chair covered with a handsome
copperplate, a readin' what the Sammist sez about "Vanity, vanity, all
is vanity."; The words struck deep, and as I said, it was jest that
very minute that the idee struck me about goin' to Saratoga.; Why
I should have had the idee at jest that minute, I can't tell, nor Josiah
can't.; We have talked about it sense.
<p>But good land! such creeters as thoughts be never wuz, nor never will
be.; They will creep in, and round, and over anything, and get inside
of your mind (entirely unbeknown to you) at any time.; Curious, haint
it? -- How you may try to hedge 'em out, and shet the doors and everything.;
But they will creep up into your mind, climb up and draw up their ladders,
and there they will be, and stalk round independent as if they owned your
hull head; curious!
<p>Well, there the idee wuz -- I never knew nothin' about it, nor how it
got there.; But there it wuz, lookin' me right in the face of my soul,
kinder pert and saucy, sayin', "You'd better go to Saratoga next summer;
you and Josiah."
<p>But I argued with it.; Sez I, "What should we go to Saratoga for?;
None of the relations live there on my side, or on hison; why should we
go?"
<p>But still that idee kep' a hantin me; "You'd better go to Saratoga next
summer, you and Josiah."; And it whispered, "Mebby it will help Josiah's
corns."; (He is dretful troubled with corns.); And so the idee
kep' a naggin' me, it nagged me for three days and three nights before
I mentioned it to my Josiah.; And when I did, he scorfed at the idee.;
He said, "The idee of water curing them dumb corns -- "
<p>Sez I, "Josiah Allen, stranger things have been done;" sez I, "that
water is very strong.; It does wonders."
<p>And he scorfed agin and sez, "Don't you believe faith could cure em?"
<center>
<p><img SRC="ch1/11.gif" height=317 width=283 ALT ="Josiah in woodlot"></center>

<p>Sez I, "If it wuz strong enough it could."
<p>But the thought kep a naggin' me stiddy, and then -- here is the curious
part of it -- the thought nagged me, and I nagged Josiah, or not exactly
nagged; not a clear nag; I despise them, and always did.; But I kinder
kep' it before his mind from day to day, and from hour to hour.; And
the idee would keep a tellin' me things and I would keep a tellin' 'em
to my companion.; The idee would keep a sayin' to me, "It is one of
the most beautiful places in our native land.; The waters will help
you, the inspirin' music, and elegance and gay enjoyment you will find
there, will sort a uplift you.; You had better go there on a tower;"
and agin it sez, "Mebby it will help Josiah's corns."
<p>And old Dr. Gale a happenin' in at about that time, I asked him about
it (he doctored me when I wuz a baby, and I have helped 'em for years.;
Good old creetur, he don't get along as well as he ort to.; Loontown
is a heALT hy place.); I told him about my strong desire to go to Saratoga,
and I asked him plain if he thought the water would help my pardner's corns.;
And he looked dreadful wise and he riz up and walked across the floor 2
and fro several times, probably 3 times to, and the same number of times
fro, with his arms crossed back under the skirt of his coat and his eyebrows
knit in deep thought, before he answered me.; Finely he said, that
modern science had not fully demonstrated yet the direct bearing of water
on corn.; In some cases it might and probably did stimulate 'em to
greater luxuriance, and then again a great flow of water might retard their
growth.
<p>Sez I, anxiously, "Then you'd advise me to go there with him?"
<p>"Yes," sez he, "on the hull, I advise you to go."
<center>
<p><img SRC="ch1/14.gif" height=265 width=341 ALT="Samantha and Dr. Gale"></center>

<p>Them words I reported to Josiah, and sez I in anxious axents, "Dr. Gale
advises us to go."
<p>And Josiah sez, "I guess I shan't mind what that old fool sez."
<p>Them wuz my pardner's words, much as I hate to tell on 'em.; But
from day to day I kep' it stiddy before him, how dang'r'us it wuz to go
ag'inst a doctor's advice.; And from day to day he would scorf at
the plan.; And I, ev'ry now and then, and mebby oftener, would get
him a extra good meal, and attack him on the subject immegatly afterwards.;
But all in vain.; And I see that when he had that immovible sotness
onto him, one extra meal wouldn't soften or molify him.; No, I see
plain I must make a more voyalent effort.; And I made it.; For
three stiddy days I put before that man the best vittles that these hands
could make, or this brain could plan.
<p>And at the end of the 3d day I gently tackled him agin on the subject,
and his state wuz such, bland, serene, happified, that he consented without
a parlay.; And so it wuz settled that the next summer we wuz to go
to Saratoga.; And he began to count on it and make preparation in
a way that I hated to see.
<p>Yes, from the very minute that our two minds wuz made up to go to Saratoga
Josiah Allen wuz set on havin' sunthin new and uneek in the way of dress
and whiskers.; I looked coldly on the idee of puttin' a gay stripe
down the legs of the new pantaloons I made for him, and broke it up, also
a figured vest.; I went through them two crisises and came out triumphent.
<p>Then he went and bought a new bright pink necktie with broad long ends
which he intended to have float out, down the front of his vest.;
And I immegatly took it for the light-colored blocks in my silk log-cabin
bedquilt.; Yes, I settled the matter of that pink neck-gear with a
high hand and a pair of shears.; And Josiah sez now that he bought
it for that purpose, for the bedquilt, because he loves to see a dressy
quilt, -- sez he always enjoys seein' a cabin look sort o' gay.; But
good land! he didn't.; He intended and calculated to wear that neck-tie
into Saratoga, -- a sight for men and angels, if I hadn't broke it up.
<p>But in the matter of whiskers, there I was powerless.; He trimmed
'em (unbeknow to me) all off the side of his face, them good honerable
side whiskers of hisen, that had stood by him for years in solemnity and
decency, and begun to cultivate a little patch on the end of his chin.;
I argued with him, and talked well on the subject, eloquent, but it wuz
of no use, I might as well have argued with the wind in March.
<p>He said, he wuz bound on goin' into Saratoga with a fashionable whisker,
come what would.
<p>And then I sithed, and he sez, -- " You have broke up my pantaloons,
my vest, and my neck-tie, you have ground me down onto plain broadcloth,
but in the matter of whiskers I am firm! Yes!" sez he "on these whiskers
I take my stand!"
<p>And agin I sithed heavy, and I sez in a dretful impressive way, as I
looked on 'em, "Josiah Allen, remember you are a father and a grandfather!"
<p>And he sez firmly, "If I wuz a great-grandfather I would trim my whiskers
in jest this way, that is if I wuz a goin' to set up to be fashionable
and a goin' to Saratoga for my heALT h."
<p>And I groaned kinder low to myself, and kep' hopin' that mebby they
wouldn't grow very fast, or that some axident would happen to 'em, that
they would get afire or sunthin'.; But they didn't.; And they
grew from day to day luxurient in length, but thin.; And his watchful
care kep' 'em from axident, and I wuz too high princepled to set fire to
'em when he wuz asleep, though sometimes, on a moonlight night, I was tempted
to, sorely tempted.
<p>But I didn't, and they grew from day to day, till they wuz the curiusest
lookin' patch o' whiskers that I ever see.; And when we sot out for
Saratoga, they wuz jest about as long as a shavin' brush, and looked some
like one.; There wuz no look of a class-leader, and a perfesser about
'em, and I told him so.; But he worshiped 'em, and gloried in the
idee of goin' afar to show 'em off.
<p>But the neighbors received the news that we wuz goin' to a waterin'
place coldly, or with ill-concealed envy.
<p>Uncle Jonas Bently told us he shouldn't think we would want to go round
to waterin' troughs at our age.
<p>And I told him it wuzn't a waterin' trough, and if it wuz, I thought
our age wuz jest as good a one as any, to go to it.
<p>He had the impression that Saratoga wuz a immense waterin' trough where
the country all drove themselves summers to be watered.; He is deef
as a Hemlock post, and I yelled up at him jest as loud as I dast for fear
of breakin' open my own chest, that the water got into us, instid of our
gettin' into the water, but I didn't make him understand, for I hearn afterwards
of his sayin' that, as nigh as he could make out we all got into the waterin'
trough and wuz watered.
<p>The school teacher, a young man, with long, small lims, and some pimpley
on the face, but well meanin', he sez to me: "Saratoga is a beautiful spah."
<center>
<p><img SRC="ch1/19.gif" height=350 width=234 ALT ="Samantha and the school teacher"></center>

<p>And I sez warmly, "It aint no such thing, it is a village, for I have
seen a peddler who went right through it, and watered his horses there,
and he sez it is a waterin' place, and a village."
<p>"Yes," sez he, "it is a beautiful village, a modest retiren city, and
at the same time it is the most noted spah on this continent."
<p>I wouldn't contend with him for it wuz on the stoop of the meetin' house,
and I believe in bein' reverent. But I knew it wuzn't no "spah," -- that
had a dreadful flat sound to me. And any way I knew I should face its realities
soon and know all about it. Lots of wimen said that for anybody who lived
right on the side of a canal, and had two good, cisterns on the place,
and a well, they didn't see why I should feel in a sufferin' condition
for any more water; and if I did, why didn't I ketch rain water?
<p>Such wuz some of the deep arguments they brung up aginst my embarkin'
on this enterprise, they talked about it sights and sights; -- why, it
lasted the neighbors for a stiddy conversation, till along about the middle
of the winter. Then the Minister's wife bought a new alpacky dress -- unbeknown
to the church till it wuz made up -- and that kind o' drawed their minds
off o' me for a spell.
<p>Aunt Polly Pixley wuz the only one who received the intelligence gladly.
And she thought she would go too. She had been kinder run down and most
bed rid for years. And she had a idee the water might help her. And I encouraged
Aunt Polly in the idee, for she wuz well off. Yes, Mr. and Miss Pixley
wuz very well off though they lived in a little mite of a dark, low, lonesome
house, with some tall Pollard willows in front of the door in a row, and
jest acrost the road from a grave-yard.
<p>Her husband had been close and wuzn't willin' to have any other luxury
or means of recreation in the house only a bass viol, that had been his
father's -- he used to play on that for hours and hours. I thought that
wuz one reason why Polly wuz so nervous. I said to Josiah that it would
have killed me outright to have that low grumblin' a goin' on from day
to day, and to look at them tall lonesome willows and grave stuns.
<p>But, howsumever, Polly's husband had died durin' the summer, and Polly
parted with the bass viol the day after the funeral. She got out some now,
and wuz quite wrought up with the idee of goin' to Saratoga.
<p>But Sister Minkley; sister in the church and sister-in-law by reason
of Wbitefield, sez to me, that she should think I would think twice before
I danced and wALT zed round wALT zes.
<p>And I sez, "I haint thought of doin' it, I haint thought of dancin'
round or square or any other shape."
<p>Sez she, "You have got to, if you go to Saratoga."
<p>Sez I, "Not while life remains in this frame."
<p>And old Miss Bobbet came up that minute -- it wuz in the store that
we were a talkin' -- and sez she, "It seems to me, Josiah Allen's wife,
that you are too old to wear low-necked dresses and short sleeves."
<p>"And I should think you'd take cold a goin' bareheaded," sez Miss Luman
Spink who wuz with her.
<p>Sez I, lookin' at 'em coldly, "Are you lunys or has softness begun on
your brains?"
<p>"Why," sez they, "you are talking about goin' to Saratoga, hain't you?"
<p>"Yes," sez I.
<p>"Well then you have got to wear 'em," says Miss Bobbet. "They don't
let anybody inside of the incorporation without they have got on a low-necked
dress and short sleeves."
<p>"And bare-headed," sez Miss Spink; "if they have' got a thing on their
heads they won't let 'em in."
<p>Sez I, "I don't believe it"
<p>Sez Miss Bobbet, "It is so, for I hearn it, and hearn it straight. James
Robbets's wife's sister had a second cousin who lived neighbor to a woman
whose niece had been there, been right there on the spot. And Celestine
Bobbet, Uncle Ephraim's Celestine, hearn it from James'es wife when she
wuz up there last spring, it come straight. They all have to go in low
necks."
<p>"And not a mite of anything on their heads," says Miss Spink.
<p>Sez I in sarcastical axents, "Do men have to go in low necks too?"
<p>"No," says Miss Bobbet. "But they have to have the tails of their coats
kinder pinted. Why," sez she, "I hearn of a man that had got clear to the
incorporation and they wouldn't let him in because his coat kinder rounded
off round the bottom, so he went out by the side of the road and pinned
up his coat tails, into a sort of a pinted shape, and good land the incorporation
let him right in, and never said a word."
<p>I contended that these things wuzn't so, but I found it wuz the prevailin'
opinion. For when I went to see the dressmaker about makin' me a dress
for the occasion, I see she felt just like the rest about it. My dress
wuz a good black alpacky. I thought I would have it begun along in the
edge of the winter, when she didn't have so much to do, and also to have
it done on time. We laid out to start on the follerin' July, and I felt
that I wanted everything ready.
<p>I bought the dress the 7th day of November early in the forenoon, the
next day after my pardner consented to go, and give 65 cents a yard for
it, double wedth. I thought I could get it done on time, dressmakers are
drove a good deal. But I felt that a dressmaker could commence a dress
in November and get it done the follerin' July, without no great strain
bein' put onto her; and I am fur from bein' the one to put strains onto
wimmen, and hurry 'em beyend their strength. But I felt Almily had time
to make it on honor and with good buttonholes.
<p>"Well," she sez, the first thing after she had unrolled the alpacky,
and held it up to the light to see if it was firm -- sez she:
<p>"I s'pose you are goin' to have it made with a long train, and low neck
and short sleeves, and the waist all girted down to a taper?"
<p>I wuz agast at the idee, and to think Alminy should broach it to me,
and I give her a piece of my mind that must have lasted her for days and
days. It wuz a long piece, and firm as iron. But she is a woman who likes
to have the last word and carry out her own idees, and she insisted that
nobody was allowed in Saratoga -- that they wuz outlawed, and laughed at
if they didn't have trains and low necks, and little mites of waists no
bigger than pipe-stems.
<p>Sez I, "Alminy Hagidone, do you s'pose that I, a woman of my age, and
a member of the meetin' house, am a goin' to wear a low-necked dress?"
<p>"Why not?," sez she, "it is all the fashion and wimmen as old agin as
you be wear 'em."
<p>Well, sez I, "It is a shame and a disgrace if they do, to say nothin'
of the wickedness of it. Who do you s'pose wants to see their old skin
and bones? It haint nothin' pretty anyway. And as fer the waists bein'
all girted up and drawed in, that is nothin' but crushed bones and flesh
and vitals, that is just crowdin' down your insides into a state o' disease
and deformity, torturin' your heart down so's the blood can't circulate,
and your lungs so's you can't breathe, it is nothin' but slow murder anyway,
and if I ever take it into my head to kill myself, Alminy Hagidone, I haint
a goin' to do it in a way of perfect torture and torment to me, I'd ruther
be drownded."
<p>She quailed, and I sez, "I am one that is goin' to take good long breaths
to the very last." She see I wuz like iron aginst the idee of bein' drawed
in, and tapered, and she desisted. I s'pose I did look skairful. But she
seemed still to cling to the idee of low necks and trains, and she sez
sort a rebukingly:
<p>"You ortn't to go to Saratoga if you haint willin' to do as the rest
do. I spose," sez she dreamily, "the streets are full of wimmen a walkin'
up and down with long trains a hangin' down and sweepin' the streets, and
ev'ry one on 'em with low necks and short sleeves, and all on 'em a flirting
with some man"
<p>"Truly," sez I, "if that is so, that is why the idee come to me. I am
needed there. I have a high mission to perform about. But I don't believe
it is so."
<p>"Then you won't have it made with a long train?" sez she, a holdin'
up a breadth of the alpacky in front of me, to measure the skirt.
<p>"No mom!" sez I, and there wuz both dignity and deep resolve in that
"mom." It wuz as firm and stern principled a "mom" as I ever see, though
I say it that shouldn't. And I see it skairt her. She measured off the
breadths kinder trembly, and seemed so anxious to pacify me that she got
it a leetle shorter in the back than it wuz in the front. And (for the
same reason) it fairly clicked me in the neck it wuz so high, and the sleeves
wuz that long that I told Josiah Allen (in confidence) I was tempted to
knit some loops across the bottom of 'em and wear 'em for mits.
<p>But I didn't, and I didn't change the dress neither. Thinkses I, mebby
it will have a good moral effect on them other old wimmen there. Thinkses
I, when they see another woman melted and shortened and choked fur principle's
sake, mebby they will pause in their wild careers.
<p>Wall, this wuz in November, and I wuz to have the dress, if it wuz a
possible thing, by the middle of April, so's to get it home in time to
sew some lace in the neck. And so havin' everything settled about goin'
I wuz calm in my frame most all the time, and so wuz my pardner.
<p>And right here, let me insert this one word of wisdom for the special
comfort of my sect and yet it is one that may well be laid to heart by
the more opposite one. If your pardner gets restless and oneasy and middlin'
cross, as pardners will be anon, or even oftener -- start them off on a
tower. A tower will in 9 cases out of 10 lift 'em out of their oneasiness,
their restlessness and their crossness.
<p>Why this is so I cannot tell, no more than I can explain other mysteries
of creation, but I know it is so. I know they will come home more placider,
more serener, and more settled-downer. Why I have known a short tower to
Slab City or Loontown act like a charm on my pardner, when crossness wuz
in his mean and snappishness wuz present with him. I have known him to
set off with the mean of a lion and come back with the liniment of a lamb.
Curious, haint it?
<p>And jest the prospect of a tower ahead is a great help to a woman in
rulin' and keepin' a pardner straight and right in his liniments and his
acts. Somehow jest the thought of a tower sort a lifts him up in mind,
and happifys him, and makes him easier to quell, and pardners must be quelled
at times, else there would be no livin' with 'em. This is known to all
wimmen companions and and men too. Great great is the mystery of pardners.
