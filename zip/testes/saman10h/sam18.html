<p>THE SOCIAL SCIENCE MEETING.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>One day Josiah and me went into a meetin' where they wuz kinder fixin'
over the world, sort a repairin' of it, as you may say. Some of the
deepest, smartest speeches I ever hearn in my life, I hearn there.
<p>You know it is a middlin' deep subject. But they rose to it.
They rose nobly to it. Some wuz for repairin' it one way, and some
another -- some wanted to kinder tinker it up, and make it over like.
Some wanted to tear it to pieces, and build it over new. But they
all meant well by the world, and nobody could help respectin' 'em.
<p>I enjoyed them hours there with 'em, jest about as well as it is in
my power to enjoy anything. They wuz all on 'em civilized Christian
folks and philanthropists of different shades and degrees, all but one.
There wuz one heathen there. A Hindoo right from Hindoostan, and
I felt kinder sorry for him. A heathen sot right in the midst of
them folks of refinement, and culture, who had spent their hull lives a
tryin' to fix over the world, and make it good.
<p>This poor little heathen, with a white piller case, or sunthin' wound
round his head (I s'pose he hadn't money to buy a hat), and his small black
eyes lookin' out kinder side ways from his dark hombly little face, rousted
up my pity, and my sympathy. There had been quite a firm speech made
against allowin' foreigners on our shores. And this little heathen,
in his broken speech, said, It all seemed so funny to him, when everybody
wuz foreigners in this country, to think that them that got here first
should say they owned it, and send everybody else back. And he said,
It seemed funny to him, that the missionarys we sent over to his land to
teach them the truth, told them all about this land of Liberty, where everybody
wuz free, and everybody could earn a home for themselves, and urged 'em
all to come over here, and then when they broke away from all that held
'em in their own land, and came thousands and thousands of milds, to get
to this land of freedom and religion,then they wuz sent back agin, and
wuzn't allowed to land. It seemed so funny.
<p>And so it did to me. And I said to myself, I wonder if they don't
lose all faith in the missionarys, and what they tell them. I wonder
if they don't have doubts about the other free country they tell 'em about.
The other home they have urged 'em to prepare for, and go to. I wonder
if they haint afraid, that when they have left their own country and sailed
away for that home of Everlastin' freedom, they will be sent back agin,
and not allowed to land.
<p>But it comferted me quite a good deal to meditate on't, that that land
didn't have no laws aginst foreign emigration. That its ruler wuz
one who held the rights of the lowest, and poorest, and most ignerent of
His children, of jest as much account as he did the rights of a king.
Thinkses I that poor little head with the piller case on it will be jest
as much looked up to, as if it wuz white and had a crown on it. And
I felt real glad to think it wuz so.
<p>But I went to every meetin' of 'em, and enjoyed every one of 'em with
a deep enjoyment. And I said then, and I say now, for folks that
had took such a hefty job as they had, they done well, nobody could do
better, and if the world wuzn't improved by their talk it wuz the fault
of the world, and not their'n.
<p>And we went to meetin' on Sunday mornin' and night, and hearn good sermons.
There's several high big churches at Saratoga, of every denomination, and
likely folks belong to the hull on 'em: There is no danger of folks losin'
their way to Heaven unless they want to, and they can go on their own favorite
paths too, be they blue Presbyterian paths, or Methodist pasters, or by
the Baptist boat, or the Episcopalian high way, or the Catholic covered
way, or the Unitarian Broadway, or the Shadow road of Spiritualism.
<p>No danger of their losin' their way unless they want to. And I
thought to myself as I looked pensively at the different steeples, "What
though there might be a good deal of'wranglin', and screechin', and puffin'
off steam, at the different stations, as there must always be where so
many different routes are a layin' side by side, each with its own different
runners, and conductors, and porters, and managers, and blowers, still
it must be, that the separate high ways would all end at last in a serener
road, where the true wayfarers and the earnest pilgrims would all walk
side by side, and forget the very name of the station they sot out from.
<p>I sez as much to my companion, as we wended our way home from one of
the meetin's, and he sez, "There haint but one right way, and it is a pity
folks can't see it." Sez he a sithin' deep, "Why can't everybody
be Methodists?"
<p>We wuz a goin' by the 'Piscopal church then, and he sez a lookin' at
it, as if he wuz sorry for it, "What a pity that such likely folks as they
be, should believe in such eronious doctrines. Why," sez he, "I have
hearn that they believe that the bread at communion is changed into sunthin'
else. What a pity that they should believe anything so strange as
that is, when there is a good, plain, practical, Christian belief that
they might believe in, when they might be Methodists. And the Baptists
now," sez he, a glancin' back at their steeple, "why can't they believe
that a drop is as good as a fountain? Why do they want to believe
in so much water? There haint no need on't. They might be Methodists
jest as well as not, and be somebody."
<p>And he walked along pensively and in deep thought, and I a feelin' somewhat
tuckered didn't argue with him, and silence rained about us till we got
in front of the hall where the Spiritualists hold their meetin's, and we
met a few a comin' out on it and then he broke out and acted mad, awful
mad and skernful, and sez he angrily, "Them dumb fools believe in supernatural
things. They don't have a shadow of reason or common sense to stand
on. A man is a fool to gin the least attention to them, or their
doin's. Why can't they believe sunthin' sensible? Why can't
they jine a church that don't have anything curius in it? Nothin'
but plain, common sense facts in it: Why can't they be Methodists?"
<p>"The idee!" sez he, a breakin' out fresh. "The idee of believin'
that folks that have gone to the other world can come back agin and appear.
Shaw!" sez he, dretful loud and bold. I don't believe I ever heard
a louder shaw in my life than that wuz, or more kinder haughty and highheaded.
<p>And then I spoke up, and sez, "Josiah, it is always well, to shaw in
the right place, and I am afraid you haint studied on it as much as you
ort. I am afraid you haint a shawin' where you ort to."
<p>"Where should I shaw?" sez he, kinder snappish.
<p>"Wall," sez I, "when you condemn other folkses beliefs, you ort to be
careful that you haint a condemin' your own belief at the same time.
Now my belief is grounded in the Methodist meetin' house like a rock; my
faith has cast its ancher there inside of her beliefs and can't be washed
round by any waves of opposin' doctrines. But I am one who can't
now, nor never could, abide bigotry and intolerance either in a Pope, or
a Josiah Allen.
<p>"And when you condemn a belief simply on the ground of its bein' miraculous
and beyond your comprehension, Josiah Allen, you had better pause and consider
on what the Methodist faith is founded.
<br>"All our orthodox meetin' houses, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist,
Episcopalian, every one on 'em, Josiah Allen, are sot down on a belief,
a deathless faith in a miraculous birth, a life of supernatural events,
the resurrection of the dead, His appearance after death, a belief in the
graves openin' and the dead comin' forth, a belief in three persons inhabitin'
one soul, the constant presence and control of spiritual influences, the
Holy Ghost, and the spirits of just men. And while you are a leanin'
up against that belief, Josiah Allen, and a leanin' heavy, don't shaw at
any other belief for the qualities you hold sacred in your own."
<p>He quailed a very little, and I went on.
<p>"If you want to shaw at it, shaw for sunthin' else in it, or else let
it entirely alone. If you think it lacks active Christian force,
if you think it is not aggressive in its assaults at Sin, if you think
it lacks faith in the Divine Head of the church, say so, do; but for mercy's
sake try to shaw in the right place."
<p>"Wall," sez he, "they are a low set that follers it up mostly, and you
know it." And his head was right up in the air, and he looked very
skernful.
<p>But I sez, "Josiah Allen, you are a shawin' agin in the wrong place,"
sez I. "If what you say is true, remember that 1800 years ago, the
same cry wuz riz up by Pharisees, `He eats with Publicans and sinners.'
They would not have a king who came in the guise of the poor, they scerned
a spiritual truth that did not sparkle with worldly lustre.
<p>"But it shone on; it lights the souls of humanity to-day. Let
us not be afraid, Josiah Allen. Truth is a jewel that cannot be harmed
by deepest investigation, by roughest handlin'. It can't be buried,
it will shine out of the deepest darkness. What is false will be
washed away, what is true will remain. For all this frettin', and
chafing, all this turbelence of conflectin' beliefs, opposin' wills, will
only polish this jewel. Truth, calm and serene, will endure, will
shine, will light up the world."
<p>He begun to look considerable softer in mean, and I continued on: "Josiah
Allen, you and I know what we believe the beautiful religion (Methodist
Episcopal) that we both love, makes a light in our two souls. But
don't let us stand in that light and yell out, that everybody else's light
is darkness; that our light is the only one. No, the heavens are
over all the earth; the twelve gates of heaven are open and a shinin' down
on all sides of us.
<p>"Jonesville meetin' house (Methodist Episcopal) haint the only medium
through which the light streams. It is dear to us, Josiah Allen,
but let us not think that we must coller everybody and drag 'em into it.
And let us not cry out too much at other folkses superstitions, when the
rock of our own faith, that comforts us in joy and sorrow, is sot in a
sea of supernaturalism.
<p>"You know how that faith comforts our two souls, how it is to us, like
the shadow of a great rock in a weary land, but they say, their belief
is the same to them, let us not judge them too hardly. No, the twelve
gates of heaven are open, Josiah Allen, and a shinin' down onto the earth.
We know the light that has streamed into our own souls, but we do not know
exactly what rays of radience may have been reflected down into some other
lives through some one of those many gates.
<p>"The plate below has to be prepared, before it can ketch the picture
and hold it. The light does not strike back the same reflection from
every earthly thing. The serene lake mirrors back the light, in a
calm flood of glory, the flashin' waterfall breaks it into a thousand dazzlin'
sparkles. The dewy petal of the yellow field lily, reflects its own
ray of golden light back, so does the dark cone of the pine tree, and the
diamond, the opal, the ruby, each tinges the light with its own coloring,
but the light is all from above. And they all reflect the light,
in their own way for which the Divine skill has prepared them.
<p>"Let us not try to compel the deep blue Ocean waves and the shinin'
waterfall, and the lily blow, to reflect back the light, in the same identical
manner. No, let the light stream down into high places, and low ones,
let the truth shine into dark hearts, and into pure souls. God is
light. God is Love. It is His light that shines down out of
the twelve gates, and though the ruby, or the amethyst, may color it by
their own medium, the light that is reflected, back is the light of Heaven.
And Josiah Allen," sez I in a deeper, earnester tone, "let us who know
so little ourselves, be patient with other ignerent ones. Let us
not be too intolerent, for no intolerence, Josiah Allen is so cruel as
that of ignerence, an' stupidity."
<p>Sez Josiah, "I won't believe in anything I can't see, Samantha Allen."
<p>I jest looked round at him witheringly, and sez I, "What have you ever
seen, Josiah Allen, I mean that is worth sein'? Haint everything
that is worth havin' in life, amongst the unseen? The deathless loves,
the aspirations, the deep hopes, and faiths, that live in us and through
us, and animate us and keep us alive, -- Whose spectacles has ever seen
'em? What are we, all of us human creeters, any way, but little atoms
dropped here, Heaven knows why, or how, into the midst of a perfect sea
of mystery, and unseen influences. What hand shoved us forwards out
of the shadows, and what hand will reach out to us from the shadows and
draw us back agin? Have you seen it Josiah Allen? You have
felt this great onseen force a movin' you along, but you haint sot your
eyes on it.
<p>"What is there above us, below us, about us, but a waste of mystery,
a power of onseen influences?.
<p>"You won't believe anything you can't see: -- Did you ever see old Gravity,
Josiah Allen, or get acquainted with him? Yet his hands hold the
worlds together. Who ever see the mysterious sunthin' in the North
that draws the ship's compass round? Who ever see that great mysterious
hand that is dropped down in the water, sweepin' it back and forth, makin'
the tides come in, and the tides go out? Who ever has ketched a glimpse
of them majestic fingers, Josiah Allen? Or the lips touched with
lightnin', whose whispers reach round the world, and through the Ocean?
You haint see 'em, nor I haint, No, Josiah Allen, we don't know much
of anything, and we don't know that for certain. We are all on us
only poor pupils down in the Earth's school-room, learnin' with difficulty
and heart ache the lessons God sets for us.
<p>Tough old Experience gives us many a hard floggin', before we learn
the day's lessons. And we find the benches hard, long before sundown.
And it makes our hearts ache to see the mates we love droop their too tired
heads in sleep, all round us before school is out. But we grind on
at our lessons, as best we may. Learnin' a little maybe. Havin'
to onlearn a sight, as the pinters move on towards four. Clasping
hands with fellow toilers and (hard task) onclaspin' 'em, as they go up
above us, or down nearer the foot. Havin' little `intermissions'
of enjoyment, soon over. But we plod on, on, and bimeby -- and sometimes
we think we do not care how soon -- the teacher will say to us, that we
can be 'dismissed.' And then we shall drop out of the rank of learners,
and the school will go without us, jest as busily, jest as cheerfully,
jest as laboriously, jest as sadly. Poor learners at the hard lessons
of life. Learnin' out of a book that is held out to us from the shadows
by an onseen, inexorable hand. Settin' on hard benches that may fall
out from under us at any time. Poor ignerent creeters that we are,
would it not be a too arrant folly for us to judge each other hardly, we,
all on us, so deplorably ignerent, so weakly helpless?"
<p>Sez Josiah, in earnest axcents, "Le's walk a little faster."
<p>And, in lookin' up, I see that he wuz readin' a advertisement.
I ketched sight of a picture ornamentin' of it. It wuz Lydia Pinkham.
And as I see that benine face, I found and recovered myself. Truly,
I had been a soarin' up, up, fur above Saratoga, Patent Medicines, Josiah
Allen, etc., etc.
<p>But when I found myself by the side of Josiah Allen once more, I moved
onwards in silence, and soon we found ourselves right by the haven where
I desired to be, -- our own tried and true boardin' house.
<p>Truly eloquence is tuckerin', very, especially when you are a soarin'
and a walkin' at the same time.
