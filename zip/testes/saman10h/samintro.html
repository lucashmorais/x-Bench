<p>Marietta Holley (1836-1926) has been called America's first female humorist.
She was an extremely popular author and a well-known suffragette. Holley,
who never married, published her first books as Josiah Allen's Wife, only
adding her own name after her success was established. She lived in an
18 room home she built in Jefferson County, New York and drove a Pierce-Arrow.
Her legacy of more than 20 books has mostly been forgotten today but they
are still very good reading.
<p>I have no information about the illustrator.
