<h1>
John's Third Letter
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The elder to Gaius the
beloved, whom I love in truth.
<p> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Beloved, I pray that
you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.
 <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> For I rejoiced greatly,
when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in
truth.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> I have no greater
joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth.
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Beloved, you do a
faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and
strangers.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> They have
testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send
them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God,  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> because for the sake of the Name
they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> We therefore ought to receive
such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> I wrote to the
assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept
what we say.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Therefore,
if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly
accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he
himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws
out of the assembly.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Beloved, don't imitate that which
is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does
evil hasn't seen God.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Demetrius has the testimony of
all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our
testimony is true.
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> I had many things to
write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> but I hope to see you soon, and
we will speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet
the friends by name.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): 3 John ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web6410h.htm or web6410h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web6411h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web6410ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you
want,<br>as it appears in our Newsletters.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,<br>
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,<br>
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New<br>
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,<br>
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>
Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>


<p>Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment<br>
method other than by check or money order.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by<br>
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be<br>
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK<br>

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
