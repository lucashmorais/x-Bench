    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THIS FOURTH READER is designed to pass the pupil from the
      comparatively easy ground occupied by the THIRD to the more
      difficult course embraced in THE UNION FIFTH READER, which is
      next higher in the series. It is, therefore, carefully graded
      to this intermediate position.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one sense, however, it is the most important in the set;
      since the great mass of pupils, in our common schools, are
      drawn away from scholastic pursuits long before the proper
      time for entering upon any course of reading more advanced
      than that which is here presented. This consideration has had
      its full weight in the preparation of the following pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every exercise will be found to bear the impress of that
      special adaptation to the purposes of teaching, without which
      no book of this kind can fully perform the office which it
      assumes. The labor expended in this direction, though all
      unseen by the casual observer, has been neither light nor
      brief. It can be duly appreciated by none but the experienced
      teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      All words in the exercises, requiring explanation, have been
      arranged, as regular lessons in spelling and definition. In
      these definitions, however, it must be kept in mind, that no
      attempt has been made to give <i>all the meanings of which a
      word is susceptible, but that only which it bears in the
      particular place in the exercise where it is found.</i> There
      is a special educational advantage in thus leading the mind
      of the pupil definitely to fix upon the <i>precise import</i>
      of a word, in some particular use or application of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All proper names occurring in the text, and at all likely to
      embarrass the learner, have been explained in brief,
      comprehensive notes. These notes involve many matters,
      Geographical, Biographical, and Historical, which are not a
      little interesting in themselves, aside from the special
      purpose subserved by them in the present connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this has been done, and more, in order to secure that
      kind of interest in the exercises which comes of reading what
      is clearly understood; and because no perfect reading is
      possible, where the reader himself fails to perceive the
      meaning of what he reads.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the selection and adaptation of the pieces, the highest
      aim has been to make and to leave the best moral impression;
      and this, not by dull and formal teachings, but by the
      pleasanter, and, therefore, more powerful, means of
      incidental and unexpected suggestion. Admonition is then most
      likely to be heeded, when it comes through the channel of
      events and circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direct and ostensible aim of the book, however, has been
      kept steadily in view; which is to furnish the best possible
      exercises for practice in Rhetorical reading. To this end,
      the greatest variety of style and sentiment has been sought.
      There is scarcely a tone or modulation, of which the human
      voice is capable, that finds not here some piece adapted
      precisely to its best expression. There is not an inflection,
      however delicate, not an emphasis, however slight, however
      strong, that does not here meet with something fitted well
      for its amplest illustration. No tenderness of pathos, no
      earnestness of thought, no play of wit, no burst of passion,
      is there, perhaps, of which the accomplished teacher of
      Elocution may not find the proper style of expression in
      these pages, and, consequently, the best examples for the
      illustration of his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, thus briefly described, is, therefore, given to the
      public with the same confidence that has hitherto inspired
      the author in similar efforts, and with the hope that it may
      reach even a higher measure of usefulness than that attained
      by any of its predecessors, in the long line of works which
      he has prepared for the use of schools.

      EXPLANATION OF THE PAUSES.
    </h2>
    <center>
      <b>.</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Period</b> is the longest pause&mdash;a full stop. It
      marks the end of a sentence, and shows the sense complete;
      as, The sky is blue`. Pause the time of counting <i>six</i>,
      and let the voice fall.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>?</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Interrogation</b> is used at the end of a question;
      as, Is the sky blue&acute;? If the question can be answered
      by <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>, the voice rises; if not, it
      falls; as, Where is your map`;? Pause the time of counting
      <i>six</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>!</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Exclamation</b> denotes wonder, surprise, pain, or
      joy; as, O&acute;! what a sweet rose`! Pause the time of
      counting <i>one</i>, after a single word, and let the voice
      rise; but after a complete sentence, pause the time of
      counting <i>six</i>, and let the voice fall.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>:</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Colon</b> is a pause shorter than the Period; as, The
      sky is clear`: the sun shines. Pause the time of counting
      <i>four</i>, and let the voice fall.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Semicolon</b> is a pause shorter than the Colon; as,
      The rose is fair`; but it soon fades. Pause the time of
      counting <i>two</i>, and let the voice fall. Sometimes the
      voice should rise, as the sense may require.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>,</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Comma</b> is the shortest pause; as, Jane goes to
      school&acute;, and learns to read. Pause the time of counting
      <i>one</i>, and keep the voice up.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>&mdash;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Dash</b> denotes a sudden pause or change of subject;
      as, I saw him&mdash;but what a sight! When the dash is used
      after any other pause, the time of that pause is doubled.
    </p>

    <h2>
      EXPLANATION OF OTHER MARKS.
    </h2>
    <center>
      <b>'</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Apostrophe</b> has the form of the comma. It denotes
      the possessive case; as, John's book; also, that one or more
      letters have been left out of a word; as, lov'd for loved.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>" "</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Quotation</b> includes a passage that is taken from
      some other author or speaker; as, John said: "See my kite."
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>( )</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Parenthesis</b> includes words not properly a part of
      the main sentence; as, I like these people (who would not?)
      very much. The words within the parenthesis should be read in
      a lower tone of voice.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>[ ]</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Brackets</b> inclose words that serve to explain the
      preceding word or sentence; as, James [the truthful boy] went
      home.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>^</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Caret</b> shows where words are to be put in that have
      been omitted by mistake; as, Live <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup>
      peace.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>&uml;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Di&aelig;resis</b> is placed over the latter of two
      vowels, to show that they belong to two distinct syllables;
      as, a&euml;rial.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>-</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Hyphen</b> is used to connect compound words; as,
      Well-doing; or the parts of a word separated at the end of a
      line.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>&rArr;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Index</b> points to something special or remarkable;
      as, &rArr; Important News!
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>*** ....</b> or <b>&mdash;&mdash;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Ellipsis</b> shows that certain words or letters have
      been purposely omitted; as, K**g, k..g, or k--g, for king.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>&para;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Paragraph</b> denotes the beginning of a new subject.
      It is chiefly used in the Bible; as, &para; The same day came
      to him, etc.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>&sect;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Section</b> is used to divide a book or chapter into
      parts; as, &sect;45.
    </p>
    <center>
      <b>* &dagger; &Dagger;</b>
    </center>
    <p>
      The <b>Asterisk</b>, the <b>Obelisk</b>, the <b>Double
      Dagger</b>, and sometimes other marks, [Footnote: For
      instance: the Section mark, &sect;, and the Parallel, ||.]
      refer to notes in the margin.

   1 My Young Friends&acute;, never tell a falsehood`; but always

    <h2>
      PART FIRST.<br>
       ELOCUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elocution is the art of delivering written or extemporaneous
      composition with force, propriety, and ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      It deals, therefore, with words, not only as individuals, but
      as members of a sentence, and parts of a connected discourse:
      including every thing necessary to the just expression of the
      sense. Accordingly, it demands, in a <i>special</i> manner,
      attention to the following particulars; viz., ARTICULATION,
      ACCENT, EMPHASIS, INFLECTION, MODULATION, and PAUSES.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <a name="sect1"><!-- Marker --></a>
    <h3>
      SECTION I.<br>
       ARTICULATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Articulation is the art of uttering distinctly and justly the
      letters and syllables constituting a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      It deals, therefore, with the elements of words, just as
      elocution deals with the elements of sentences: the one
      securing the true enunciation of each letter, or combination
      of letters, the other giving to each word, or combination of
      words, such a delivery as best expresses the meaning of the
      author. It is the basis of all good reading, and should be
      carefully practiced by the learner.

       ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      ACCENT and EMPHASIS both indicate some special stress of
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accent is that stress of voice by which one <i>syllable</i>
      of a word is made more prominent than others; EMPHASIS is
      that stress of voice by which one or more <i>words</i> of a
      sentence are distinguished above the rest.
    </p>
    <center>
      ACCENT.
    </center>
    <p>
      The accented syllable is sometimes designated thus:
      (&prime;); as, <i>com-mand&prime;-ment</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE I.&mdash;Words of more than two syllables generally have
      two or more of them accented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more forcible stress of voice, is called the <i>Primary
      Accent</i>; and the less forcible, the <i>Secondary
      Accent</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLES OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ACCENT.
    </center>
    <p>
      In the following examples the Primary Accent is designated by
      double accentual marks, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ed&Prime;-u-cate&prime;</i>,
      <i>ed&prime;-u-ca&Prime;-tion</i>,
      <i>mul&Prime;-ti-ply&prime;</i>,
      <i>mul&prime;-ti-pli-ca&Prime;-tion</i>,
      <i>sat&Prime;-is-fy&prime;</i>,
      <i>sat&prime;-is-fac&Prime;-tion</i>,
      <i>com&prime;-pre-hend&Prime;</i>,
      <i>com&prime;-pre-hen&Prime;-sion</i>,

      changes its meaning.

      NOTE III.&mdash;Emphatic words are often printed in
      <i>Italics</i>. When, however, different degrees of emphasis
      are to be denoted, the higher degrees are designated by the
      use of Capitals, <span class="lg-caps">LARGER</span> or
      <span class="sm-caps">SMALLER</span>, according to the degree
      of intensity.

      as well as the <i>degree</i> and <i>kind</i> of emphasis to

      <i>sentiment</i> to be expressed. The idea is sometimes
      entertained that emphasis consists merely in <i>loudness</i>
      of tone. But it should be borne in mind that the most
      <i>intense</i> emphasis may often be effectively expressed,

      NOTE II.&mdash;In some instances of a pause of suspension,
      the sense requires an intense <i>falling</i> inflection.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLE.
    </center>
    <p>
      1. The prodigal, if he does not become a <i>pauper</i>`,
      will, at least, have but little to bestow on others.
    </p>
    <p>
      REMARK.&mdash;If the <i>rising</i> inflection is given on
      <i>pauper</i>, the sense would be perverted, and the passage
      made to mean, that, in order to be able to bestow on others,
      it is necessary that he should become a pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      RULE VI. Expressions of tenderness, as of grief, or kindness,

      penultimate pause in order to promote variety, since the
      voice generally falls at the end of a sentence.

    <p>
      REMARK.&mdash;To read the foregoing example in one dull,
      monotonous tone of voice, without regard to the sentiment
      expressed, would render the passage extremely insipid and
      lifeless. But by a proper modulation of the voice, it infuses
      into the mind of the reader or hearer the most animating and
      exciting emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice is modulated in <i>three</i> different ways.
      <i>First</i>, it is varied in PITCH; that is, from
      <i>high</i> to <i>low</i> tones, and the reverse.
      <i>Secondly</i>, it is varied in QUANTITY, or in
      <i>loudness</i> or <i>volume</i> of sound. <i>Thirdly</i>, it
      is varied in QUALITY, or in the <i>kind</i> of sound
      expressed.
    </p>
    <h4>
      PITCH OF VOICE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Pitch of voice has reference to its degree of elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person, in reading or speaking, assumes a certain
      pitch, which may be either <i>high</i> or <i>low</i>,
      according to circumstances, and which has a governing
      influence on the variations of the voice, above and below it.
      This degree of elevation is usually called the KEY NOTE.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an exercise in varying the voice in pitch, the practice of
      uttering a sentence on the several degrees of elevation, as
      represented in the following scale, will be found beneficial.
      First, utter the musical syllables, then the vowel sound, and
      lastly, the proposed sentence,&mdash;ascending and
      descending.
    </p>
    <pre>
---------8.--do--#--<i>e</i>-in-m<i>e</i>.---Virtue alone survives.----
        7.  si  #  <i>i</i> in d<i>i</i>e.  Virtue alone survives.

  1.  do  #  <i>a</i> in <i>a</i>ll.  Virtue alone survives
</pre>
    <p>
      Although the voice is capable of as many variations in
      speaking, as are marked on the musical scale, yet for all the
      purposes of ordinary elocution, it will be sufficiently exact
      if we make but <i>three</i> degrees of variation, viz., the
      <i>Low</i>, the <i>Middle</i>, and the <i>High</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. THE LOW PITCH is that which falls below the usual speaking
      key, and is employed in expressing emotions of
      <i>sublimity</i>, <i>awe</i>, and <i>reverence</i>.
    </p>
    <center>

      and <i>moderate emotion</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLES.

      the earth moist, the whole face of the creation fresh and

    <br>
    <p>
      3. THE HIGH PITCH is that which rises above the usual
      speaking key, and is used in expressing <i>joyous</i> and
      <i>elevated feelings</i>.

    </p>
    <h4>
      QUANTITY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      QUANTITY is two-fold;&mdash;consisting in FULLNESS or VOLUME
      of sound, as <i>soft</i> or <i>loud</i>; and in TIME, as
      <i>slow</i> or <i>quick</i>. The former has reference to
      STRESS; the latter, to MOVEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The degrees of variation in quantity are numerous, varying
      from a slight, soft whisper to a vehement shout. But for all
      practical purposes, they may be considered as <i>three</i>,
      the same as in pitch;&mdash;the <i>soft</i>, the
      <i>middle</i>, and the <i>loud</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For exercise in quantity, let the pupil read any sentence,
      as,
    </p>
    <pre>
  "Beauty is a fading flower,"
</pre>
    <p>
      first in a slight, soft tone, and then repeat it, gradually
      increasing in quantity to the full extent of the voice. Also,
      let him read it first very slowly, and then repeat it,
      gradually increasing the movement. In doing this, he should
      be careful not to vary the pitch.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      In like manner, let him repeat any vowel sound, or all of
      them, and also inversely. Thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      [Illustration]<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
       [Transcriber's Note: The illustration is a row of the letter
      "O," increasing in size across the page, followed by a row of
      the letter "O" decreasing in size. The presumed intent is to
      convey loudness.]
    </p>
    <p>
      REMARK.&mdash;Quantity is often mistaken for Pitch. But it
      should be borne in mind that quantity has reference to
      <i>loudness</i> or <i>volume</i> of sound, and pitch to the
      <i>elevation</i> or <i>depression</i> of a tone. The
      difference may be distinguished by the slight and heavy
      strokes on a bell;&mdash;both of which produce sounds alike
      in <i>pitch</i>; but they differ in <i>quantity</i> or
      <i>loudness</i>, in proportion as the strokes are light or
      heavy.
    </p>
    <h4>
      RULES FOR QUANTITY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. SOFT, OR SUBDUED TONES, are those which range from a
      whisper to a complete vocality, and are used to express
      <i>fear</i>, <i>caution</i>, <i>secrecy</i>,
      <i>solemnity</i>, and all <i>tender emotions</i>.

      QUALITY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      QUALITY has reference to <i>the kind of sound</i> uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two sounds may be alike in quantity and pitch, yet differ in
      quality. The sounds produced on the clarinet and flute may
      agree in pitch and quantity, yet be unlike in quality. The
      same is true in regard to the tones of the voice of two
      individuals. This difference is occasioned mainly by the
      different positions of the vocal organs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The qualities of voice mostly used in reading or speaking,
      and which should receive the highest degree of culture, are
      the <i>Pure Tone</i>, the <i>Orotund</i>, the
      <i>Aspirated</i>, and the <i>Guttural</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      RULES FOR QUALITY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. THE PURE TONE is a clear, smooth, sonorous flow of sound,
      usually accompanied with the middle pitch of voice, and is
      adapted to express emotions of <i>joy, cheerfulness,
      love</i>, and <i>tranquillity</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLE.
    </center>
    <pre>
Hail! beauteous stranger of the wood,
  Attendant on the spring,
Now heaven repairs thy vernal seat,
  And woods thy welcome sing.
</pre>
    <p>
      2. THE OROTUND is a full, deep, round, and pure tone of
      voice, peculiarly adapted in expressing <i>sublime</i> and
      <i>pathetic emotions</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLE.
    </center>
    <pre>
  It thunders! Sons of dust, in reverence bow!
  Ancient of Days! Thou speakest from above:
  Almighty! trembling, like a timid child,
  I hear thy awful voice. Alarmed&mdash;afraid&mdash;
  I see the flashes of thy lightning wild,
  And in the very grave would hide my head.
</pre>
    <p>
      3. THE ASPIRATED TONE of voice is not a pure, vocal sound,
      but rather a forcible breathing utterance, and is used to
      express <i>amazement, fear, terror, anger, revenge,
      remorse</i>, and <i>fervent emotions</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLE.
    </center>
    <pre>
  Oh, coward conscience, how dost thou affright me!
  The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight;
  Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
</pre>
    <p>
      4. THE GUTTURAL QUALITY is a deep, aspirated tone of voice,
      used to express <i>aversion, hatred, loathing</i>, and
      <i>contempt</i>.
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLE.
    </center>
    <pre>
Tell me I <i>hate</i> the bowl?
  HATE is a feeble word:
I <i>loathe</i>, ABHOR, my very soul
  With strong disgust is stirred,
Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell,

    <h4>
      THE RHETORICAL PAUSE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      RHETORICAL PAUSES are those which are frequently required by
      the voice in reading and speaking, although the construction
      of the passage admits of no grammatical point.
    </p>
    <p>
      These pauses should be as manifest to the ear, as those which
      are indicated by the comma, semicolon, or other grammatical
      points, though not commonly denoted by any visible sign. In
      the following examples they are denoted thus, (||).
    </p>
    <center>
      EXAMPLES.

    </p>
    <pre>
  In slumbers of midnight || the sailor-boy lay,
    His hammock swung loose || at the sport of the wind;
  But watch-worn and weary, || his cares flew away,
    And visions of happiness || danced o'er his mind.

  There is a land, || of every land the pride,
  Beloved of heaven || o'er all the world beside;
  Where brighter suns || dispense serener light,
  And milder moons || imparadise the night.
  O, thou shalt find, || howe'er thy footsteps roam,
  That land thy country, || and that spot thy home!
</pre><br>
    <br>
    <p>

    <p>
      It is of the utmost importance, in order to secure an easy
      and elegant style in reading, to refer the pupil often to the
      more important principles involved in a just elocution. To
      this end, it will be found very advantageous, occasionally to
      review the rules and directions given in the preceding pages,
      and thus early accustom him to apply them in the subsequent
      reading lessons. For a wider range of examples and
      illustrations, it is only necessary to refer to the numerous
      and various exercises which form the body of this book. They
      have been selected, in many cases, with a special view to
      this object.

    <h4>
      TRUE HEROISM.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      OSBORNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I shall never forget a lesson which I received when quite
      a young lad, while attending an Academy. Among my schoolmates
      were Hartly and Vincent. They were both older than myself,
      and Vincent was looked up to, as a sort of leader in matters
      of opinion, and in directing our sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. He was not, at heart, a malicious boy; but he had a
      foolish ambition of being thought witty and sarcastic; and he
      made himself feared by a habit of turning things into
      ridicule. He seemed to be constantly looking out for
      something to occur, which he could turn into derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Hartly was a new scholar, and little was known of him
      among the boys. One morning as we were on our way to school,
      he was seen driving a cow along the road toward the pasture.
      A group of boys, among whom was Vincent, met him as he was
      passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "Now," said Vincent, "let us have a little sport with our
      country rustic." So saying, he exclaimed: "Halloo, Jonathan!
      [Footnote: A title frequently applied to the Yankees by the
      English.] what is the price of milk? What do you feed her on?
      What will you take for all the gold on her horns? Boys, if
      you want to see the latest Paris style, look at those boots!"
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Hartly waved his hand at us with a pleasant smile, and,
      driving the cow to the field, took down the bars of a
      rail-fence, saw her safely in the pasture, and then, putting
      up the bars, came and entered the school with the rest of us.
      After school, in the afternoon, he let out the cow, and drove
      her away, none of us knew where. Every day, for two or three
      weeks, he went through the same task.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The boys who attended the Academy, were nearly all the
      sons of wealthy parents, and some of them were foolish enough
      to look down, with a sort of disdain, upon a scholar who had
      to drive a cow to pasture; and the sneers and jeers of
      Vincent were often repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. One day, he refused to sit next to Hartly in school, on a
      pretense that he did not like the odor of the barn. Sometimes
      he would inquire of Hartly after the cow's health,
      pronouncing the word "ke-ow," after the manner of some
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Hartly bore all these silly attempts to wound his feelings
      and annoy him, with the utmost good nature. He never once
      returned an angry look or word. One time, Vincent said:
      "Hartly, I suppose your father intends to make a milkman of
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "Why not?" said Hartly. "Oh, nothing," said Vincent; "only
      do not leave much water in the cans after rinsing
      them&mdash;that's all!" The boys laughed, and Hartly, not in
      the least mortified, replied: "Never fear; if I ever rise to
      be a milkman, I will give <i>good measure</i> and <i>good
      milk</i> too."
    </p>
    <p>
      10. A few days after this conversation, there was a public
      exhibition, at which a number of ladies and gentlemen from
      the city, was present. Prizes were awarded by the Principal
      of the Academy, and Hartly and Vincent each received one;
      for, in respect to scholarship, they were about equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. After the prizes were distributed, the Principal remarked
      that there was <i>one prize</i>, consisting of a medal, which
      was <i>rarely</i> awarded, not so much on account of its
      great value, as because the instances are <i>rare</i> that
      merit it. It is THE PRIZE FOR HEROISM. The last boy on whom
      it was conferred, was Master Manners, who, three years ago,
      rescued the blind girl from drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The Principal then said, "With the permission of the
      company, I will relate a short story. Not long since, some
      boys were flying a kite in the street, just as a poor boy on
      horseback rode by, on his way to mill. The horse took fright,
      and threw the boy, injuring him so badly that he was carried
      home, and confined for some weeks to his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "None of the boys who had caused the disaster, followed
      to learn the fate of the wounded boy. There was one, however,
      who witnessed the accident from a distance, and went to
      render what service he could. He soon learned that the
      wounded boy was the grandson of a poor widow, whose only
      support consisted in selling the milk of a fine cow, of which
      she was the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. "Alas! what could she now do? She was old and lame, and
      her grandson, on whom she depended to drive the cow to
      pasture, was now sick and helpless. 'Never mind, good woman,'
      said the boy, 'I can drive your cow.' With thanks, the poor
      widow accepted his offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. "But the boy's kindness did not stop here. Money was
      wanted to purchase medicine. 'I have money that my mother
      sent me to buy a pair of boots,' said the boy; 'but I can do
      without them for the present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      16. "'Oh, no!' said the old lady, 'I can not consent to that;
      but here is a pair of cowhide boots that I bought for Henry,
      who can not wear them. If you will buy them, giving me what
      they cost, I can get along very well.' The boy bought the
      boots, clumsy as they were, and has worn them up to this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. "When the other boys of the Academy saw this scholar
      driving a cow to the pasture, he was assailed with laughter
      and ridicule. His thick cowhide boots, in particular, were
      made matters of mirth. But he kept on cheerfully and bravely,
      day after day, driving the widow's cow to the pasture, and
      wearing his thick boots, contented in the thought that he was
      <i>doing right</i>, not caring for all the jeers and sneers
      that could be uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. "He never undertook to explain why he drove the cow; for
      he was not inclined to display his charitable motives, and
      besides, in heart, he had no sympathy with the false pride
      that looks with ridicule on any useful employment. It was by
      <i>mere accident</i> that his course of conduct and
      self-denial, was yesterday discovered by his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. "And now, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you. Was
      there not <i>true heroism</i> in this boy's conduct? Nay,
      Master Hartly, do not steal out of sight behind the
      blackboard! You were not ashamed of <i>ridicule</i>&mdash;you
      must not shun <i>praise. Come forth, come forth, Master
      Edward James Hartly, and let us see your honest face!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      20. As Hartly, with blushing cheeks, made his appearance, the
      whole company greeted him with a round of applause for his
      <i>heroic conduct</i>. The ladies stood upon benches, and
      waved their handkerchiefs. The old men clapped their hands,
      and wiped the moisture from the corners of their eyes. Those
      clumsy boots on Hartly's feet seemed prouder ornaments, than
      a crown would have been on his head. The medal was bestowed
      on him, amid the applause of the whole company.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. Vincent was heartily ashamed of his ill-natured sneers,
      and, after the school was dismissed, he went, with tears in
      his eyes, and tendered his hand to Hartly, making a handsome
      apology for his past ill manners. "Think no more about it,"
      said Hartly; "let us all go and have a ramble in the woods,
      before we break up for vacation." The boys, one and all,
      followed Vincent's example, and then, with shouts and huzzas,
      they all set forth into the woods&mdash;a happy, cheerful
      group.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. In what way did Vincent try to make
      derision of Hartly? 2. How did Hartly receive it? 3. For what
      did Hartly receive a prize from his teacher? 4. How did the
      spectators manifest their approbation of Hartly's conduct?

    <h4>
      THE YOUNG CAPTIVES.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. Many years ago, dining the early settlements in New
      England, the children were accustomed to gather large
      quantities of nuts, which grew in great abundance in the
      forests that surrounded their little plantations.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In one of these nut-gatherings, a little boy and girl, the
      one eight and the other four years of age, whose mother was
      dead, became separated from their companions. On their way
      home, they came across some wild grapes, and were busily
      engaged in gathering them, till the last rays of the setting
      sun were fading away.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Suddenly they were seized by two Indians. The boy
      struggled violently, and his little sister cried to him for
      protection; but in vain. The Indians soon bore them far
      beyond the bounds of the settlement. Night was far advanced
      before they halted. Then they kindled a fire, and offered the
      children some food.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The heart of the boy swelled high with grief and anger,
      and he refused to eat. But the poor little girl took some
      parched corn from the hand of the Indian who held her on his
      knee. He smiled as he saw her eat the kernels, and look up in
      his face with a wondering, yet reproachful eye. Then they lay
      down to sleep in the dark forest, each with an arm over his
      little captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Great was the alarm in the colony when these children did
      not return. Every spot was searched, where it was thought
      possible they might have lost their way. But when, at length,
      their little basket was found, overturned in a tangled
      thicket, they came to the conclusion that they must have been
      captured by the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It was decided that before any warlike measures were
      adopted, the father should go peacefully to the Indian king,
      and demand his children. At the earliest dawn of morning he
      departed with his companions. They met a friendly Indian
      pursuing the chase, who consented to be their guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. They traveled through rude paths, until the day drew near
      a close. Then, approaching a circle of native dwellings, in
      the midst of which was a tent, they saw a man of lofty form,
      with a coronet of feathers upon his brow, and surrounded by
      warriors. The guide saluted him as his monarch, and the
      bereaved father, bowing down, thus addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "King of the red men, thou seest a father in pursuit of
      his lost children. He has heard that your people will not
      harm the stranger in distress. So he trusts himself
      fearlessly among you. The king of our own native land, who
      should have protected us, became our foe. We fled from our
      dear homes&mdash;from the graves of our fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "The ocean wave brought us to this New World. We are a
      peaceful race, pure from the blood of all men. We seek to
      take the hand of our red brethren. Of my own kindred, none
      inhabit this wilderness, save two little buds, from a broken,
      buried stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "Last night, sorrow entered into my soul, because I found
      them not. Knowest thou, O king, if thy people have taken my
      children'? Knowest thou where they have concealed them'?
      Cause them, I pray thee, to be restored to my arms. So shall
      the Great Spirit bless thy own tender plants, and lift up thy
      heart when it weigheth heavily on they bosom."
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The Indian monarch, fixing on him a piercing glance,
      said: "Knowest thou me'? Look in my eyes`! Look`! Answer me`!
      Are they the eyes of a stranger`!" The bereaved father
      replied that he had no recollection of having ever before
      seen his countenance.

    <p>
      12. "Thus it is with the white man. He is dim-eyed. He
      looketh on the <i>garments</i> more than on the <i>soul</i>.
      Where your plows turn up the earth, oft have I stood watching
      your toil. There was no coronet on my brow. But I was king.
      And you knew it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "I looked upon your people. I saw neither pride nor
      violence. I went an <i>enemy</i>, but returned a
      <i>friend</i>. I said to my warriors, 'Do these men no harm.
      They do not hate Indians.' Then our white-haired prophet of
      the Great Spirit rebuked me. He bade me make no league with
      the pale faces, lest angry words should be spoken of me,
      among the shades of our buried kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. "Yet, again, I went where thy brethren have reared their
      dwellings. Yes; I entered thy house. <i>And thou knowest not
      this brow'?</i> I could tell <i>thine</i> at midnight, if but
      a single star trembled through the clouds. My ear would know
      <i>thy</i> voice, though the storm was abroad with all its
      thunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. "I have said that I was king. Yet I came to thee hungry,
      and thou gavest me bread. My head was wet with the tempest.
      Thou badest me lie down on thy couch, and thy son, for whom
      thou mournest, covered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. "I was sad in spirit, and thy little daughter, whom thou
      seekest with tears, sat on my knee. She smiled when I told
      her how the beaver buildeth his house in the forest. My heart
      was comforted, for I saw that she did not hate Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. "Turn not on me such a terrible eye. I am no stealer of
      babes. I have reproved the people who took thy children. I
      have sheltered them for thee. Not a hair of their head is
      hurt. Thinkest thou that the red man can forget kindness'?
      They are sleeping in my tent. Had I but a single blanket, it
      should have been their bed. Take them, and return unto thy
      people."
    </p>
    <p>
      18. He waved his hand to an attendant, and, in a moment, the
      two children were in the arms of their father. The white men
      were kindly sheltered for that night, and, the next day, they
      bore the children to their home, and the people rejoiced at
      their safe return.

      MY MOTHER'S LAST KISS.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      MRS. E. OAKES SMITH.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I was but five years old when my mother died; but her
      image is as fresh in my mind, now that twenty years have
      elapsed, as it was at the time of her death. I remember her,
      as a pale, gentle being, with a sweet smile, and a voice soft
      and cheerful when she praised me; and when I had erred, (for
      I was a wild, thoughtless child,) there was a mild and tender
      earnestness in her reproofs, that always went to my little
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Methinks I can now see her large, blue eyes moist with
      sorrow, because of my childish waywardness, and hear her
      repeat: "My child, how can you grieve me so?" She had, for a
      long time, been pale and feeble, and sometimes there would
      come a bright spot on her cheek, which made her look so
      lovely, I thought she must be well. But then she spoke of
      dying, and pressed me to her bosom, and told me to be good
      when she was gone, and to love my father, and be kind to him;
      for he would have no one else to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. I recollect she was ill all day, and my little hobbyhorse
      and whip were laid aside, and I tried to be very quiet. I did
      not see her for the whole day, and it seemed very long. At
      night, they told me my mother was too sick to kiss me, as she
      always had done before I went to bed, and I must go without
      it. But I could not. I stole into the room, and placing my
      lips close to hers, whispered: "Mother, dear mother, won't
      you kiss me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Her lips were very cold, and when she put her hand upon my
      cheek, and laid my head on her bosom, I felt a cold
      shuddering pass all through me. My father carried me from the
      room; but he could not speak. After they put me in bed, I lay
      a long while thinking; I feared my mother would, indeed, die;
      for her cheek felt cold, as my little sister's did when she
      died, and they carried her little body away where I never saw
      it again. But I soon fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In the morning I rushed to my mother's room, with a
      strange dread of evil to come upon me. It was just as I
      feared. A white linen covered her straight, cold form. I
      removed it from her face: her eyes were closed, and her
      cheeks were hard and cold. But my mother's dear, dear smile
      was there, or my heart would have broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. In an instant, all the little faults, for which she had so
      often reproved me, rushed upon my mind. I longed to tell her
      how good I would always be, if she would but stay with me. I
      longed to tell her how, in all time to come, her words would
      be a law to me. I would be all that she had wished me to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. I was a passionate, headstrong boy; and never did this
      frame of temper come upon me, but I seemed to see her mild,
      tearful eyes full upon me, just as she used to look in life;
      and when I strove for the mastery over my passions, her smile
      seemed to cheer my heart, and I was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. My whole character underwent a change, even from the
      moment of her death. Her spirit seemed to be always with me,
      <i>to aid the good</i> and <i>root out the evil</i> that was
      in me. I felt it would grieve her gentle spirit to see me
      err, and I <i>could not</i>, <i>would not</i>, do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. I was the child of her affection. I knew she had prayed
      and wept over me; and that even on the threshold of the
      grave, her anxiety for my welfare had caused her spirit to
      linger, that she might pray once more for me. I never forgot
      my mother's last kiss. It was with me in sorrow; it was with
      me in joy; it was with me in moments of evil, like a
      perpetual good.

      THE DEAD CHILD'S FORD.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      MRS. E. OAKES SMITH.
    </p>
    <pre>
1. "Dear mother, here's the <i>very</i> place
     Where little John was found,
   The water covering up his face,
     His feet upon the ground.
   Now won't you tell me <i>all about</i>
     The death of little John'?
   And how the woman sent him out
     Long after sun was down'?
   And tell me <i>all about the wrong</i>,
     And <i>that</i> will make the story long."
2. I took the child upon my knee
     Beside the lake so clear;
   For <i>there</i> the tale of misery
     Young Edward begged to hear
   He looked into my <i>very</i> eyes,
     With sad and earnest face,
   And caught his breath with wild surprise,
     And turned to mark the place
   Where <i>perished</i>, years agone, the child
   Alone, beneath the waters wild.
3. "A weakly orphan boy was John,
      A barefoot, stinted child,
   Whose work-day task was never done,
     Who wept when others smiled.
   Around his home the trees were high,
     Down to the water's brink,
   And almost hid the pleasant sky,
     Where wild deer came to drink."
(")"And did they come, the pretty deer'?
    And did they drink the water here'?"
4. Cried Edward, with a wondering eye:
     "Now, mother, tell to me,
   Was John about as <i>large</i> as I'?
     Pray tell, how <i>big</i> was he'?"
   "He was an <i>older</i> boy than <i>you</i>,
     And <i>stouter</i> every way;
   For, water from the well he drew,
     And hard he worked all day.
   But then poor John was sharp and thin,
   With sun-burnt hair and sun-burnt skin.
5. "His mother used to spin and weave;
    From farm to farm she went;
  And, though it made her much to grieve,
    She John to service sent.
  He lived with one, a woman stern,
    Of hard and cruel ways;
  And he must bring her wood to burn,
    From forest and highways;
  And then, at night, on cold, hard bed,
  He laid his little, aching head.
6. "The weary boy had toiled all day
    With heavy spade and hoe;
  His mistress met him on the way,
    And bade him quickly go
  And bring her home some sticks of wood,
    For she would bake and brew;
  When he returned, she'd give him food;
    For she had much to do.
  And then she charged him not to stay,
  Nor loiter long upon the way.
7. "He went; but scarce his toil-worn feet
    Could crawl along the wood,
  He was so spent with work and heat,
    And faint for lack of food.
  He bent his aching, little back
    To bear the weight along,
  And staggered then upon the track;
    For John was <i>never</i> strong;
  His eyesight, too, began to fail,
  And he grew giddy, faint, and pale.
8. "The load was small, <i>quite</i> small, 'tis true,
    But John could bring no more;
   The woman in a rage it threw,&mdash;
    She stamped upon the floor.
(<i>f</i>.) 'No supper you shall have to-night;
    So go along to bed,
   You good-for-nothing, ugly fright,
    You little stupid-head!'"
   Said Edward: "<i>I</i> would <i>never</i> go;
   She wouldn't <i>dare</i> to serve <i>me</i> so!"
9. "The moon-beams fell upon the child
    As, weeping, there he lay;
   And gusty winds were sweeping wild
    Along the forest way,
   When up rose John, at dead of night;
    For he would see his mother;
<i>She</i> loved her child, although <i>he</i> might
    Be <i>nothing</i> to another.
   That narrow creek he forded o'er,&mdash;
   'Tis nearer than around the shore.
10. "But here the shore is rough, you see;
    The bank is high and steep;
   And John, who climbed on hands and knee,
    His footing could not keep.
   He backward fell, all, all alone;
    Too weak was he to rise;
(<i>pl.</i>) And no one heard his dying moan,
    Or closed his dying eyes.
   How still he slept! And grief and pain
   Could never come to him again.
11. "A stranger, passing on his way,
      Found him, as you have said;
    His feet were out upon the clay,
      The water o'er his head.
    And then his foot-prints showed the path
      He took, adown the creek,
    When he escaped the woman's wrath,
      So hungry, faint, and weak.
    And people now, as you have heard,
      Do call the place, THE DEAD CHILD'S FORD."

    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Was John an orphan, or half orphan? 2.

    </h4>[Footnote: For an explanation of the term fable, see page
    236.]<br>

    <p>
      1. Two beggars, LAME and LAZY, were in want of bread.
      <i>One</i> leaned on his crutch, the <i>other</i> reclined on
      his couch. Lame called on Charity, and humbly asked for a
      <i>cracker</i>. Instead of a cracker, he received a
      <i>loaf</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Lazy, seeing the gift of Charity, exclaimed: "What`! ask a
      <i>cracker</i> and receive a <i>loaf'</i>? Well, I will ask a
      loaf." Lazy now applied to Charity, and called for a loaf of
      bread. "Your demanding a loaf," said Charity, "proves you a
      <i>loaf</i>-er. You are of that class and character who
      <i>ask</i> and <i>receive not</i>; because you ask amiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Lazy, who always found fault, and had rather whine than
      work, complained of <i>ill-treatment</i>, and even accused
      Charity of a breach of an exceeding great and precious
      promise: "Ask, and ye shall receive."
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Charity pointed him to a painting in her room, which
      presented to his vision three personages, Faith, Hope and
      Charity. Charity appeared larger and fairer than her sisters.
      He noticed that her right hand held a pot of honey, which fed
      a bee disabled, having lost its wings. Her left hand was
      armed with a whip to keep off the drones.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "I do not understand it," said Lazy. Charity replied: "It
      means that Charity <i>feeds</i> the lame, and <i>flogs</i>
      the lazy." Lazy turned to go. "Stop," said Charity, "instead
      of <i>coin</i>, I will give you <i>counsel</i>. Do not go and
      live on your poor mother; I will send you to a <i>rich
      ant</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "<i>Rich aunt'</i>?" echoed Lazy. "Where shall I find
      her'?" "You will find a description of her," replied Charity,
      "in Proverbs, sixth chapter, sixth, seventh, and eighth
      verses, which read as follows: 'Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
      consider her ways, and be wise; which, having no guide,
      overseer, or ruler, provided her meat in summer, and
      gathereth her food in the harvest.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      7. MORAL. Instead of waiting and wishing for a rich UNCLE to
      <i>die</i>, go and see how a rich ANT <i>lives</i>.

      ELIZA A. CHASE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. "Is Mr. Harris in'?" inquired a plainly, but neatly
      dressed boy, twelve or thirteen years of age, of a clerk, as
      he stood by the counter of a large bookstore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk regarded the boy with a haughty look, and answered:
      "Mr. Harris is in; but he is engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The boy looked at the clerk hesitatingly, and then said:
      "If he is not particularly engaged, I would like to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have any business to transact, <i>I</i> can attend to
      it," replied the clerk. "Mr. Harris can not be troubled with
      boys like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. "What is this, Mr. Morley?" said a pleasant-looking man,
      stepping up to the clerk; "what does the boy want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He insisted on seeing you, though I told him you were
      engaged," returned the clerk, a little abashed by the manner
      of his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "And what do you wish to see me about, my lad?" inquired
      Mr. Harris, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy raised his eyes, and, meeting the scornful glance of
      the clerk, said timidly: "I wish you to look at the bill of
      some books which I bought here, about three months since.
      There is a mistake in it, which I wish to correct."
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "Ah, my boy, I see," replied Mr. Harris; "you have
      <i>overpaid</i> us, I suppose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," answered the boy. "On the contrary, I purchased
      some books which are <i>not charged</i> in the bill, and I
      have called to pay for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Mr. Harris looked at the boy earnestly for a moment, and
      then asked: "When did you discover this mistake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until I reached home," replied the lad. "When I paid for
      the books I was in a great hurry, fearing the boat would
      leave before I could reach it, and I did not examine the
      bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. "Why did you not return before, and rectify the mistake?"
      asked the gentleman, in a tone slightly altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, sir, I live some distance from the city, and have
      not been able to return till now."
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "My dear boy," said Mr. Harris, "you have given me great
      pleasure. In a long life of mercantile business, I have never
      met with an instance of this kind before. You have <i>acted
      nobly</i> and deserve a recompense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask no recompense," returned the boy. "<i>I have done
      nothing but my duty</i>&mdash;a simple act of justice, and
      that deserves no reward, but itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "May I ask who taught you such noble principles'?"
      inquired Mr. Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother'," answered the boy, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "Blessed is the child who has such a mother," said Mr.
      Harris, "and blessed is the mother of such a child. Be
      faithful to her teachings, my dear boy, and you will be the
      staff of her declining years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir," said the boy, "my mother is dead! It was her
      sickness and death which prevented me from coming here
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "What is your name?" inquired Mr. Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edward Delong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a father living'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. My father died when I was an infant."
    </p>
    <p>
      12. "Where do you reside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the town of Linwood, about fifty miles from this city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my boy, what are the books which were forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tacitus and a Latin Dictionary."
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "Let me see the bill. Ha! signed by A. C. Morley. I will
      see to that. Here, Mr. Morley!" called Mr. Harris; but the
      clerk was busily engaged in waiting on a customer at the
      opposite side of the store, bowing and smiling in the most
      attentive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. "Edward," continued Mr. Harris, "I am not going to
      <i>reward</i> you for what you have done; but I wish to
      manifest my approbation of your conduct in such a manner, as
      to make you remember the wise and excellent precepts of your
      departed mother. Select from my store any ten books you
      choose, which, in addition to the two you had before, shall
      be a <i>present</i> to you; and henceforth, as now, my boy,
      remember and not 'despise the day of small things.' If ever
      you need a friend, call on me, and I will assist you."
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The grateful boy thanked his kind benefactor, and, with
      tears in his eyes, bowed and left the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Delong wished for knowledge, and, though the scanty
      means left him by his mother, could hardly satisfy his
      desire, by diligence and economy he had advanced far beyond
      most boys of his age. By working nights and mornings for a
      neighbor, he had amassed, what seemed to him, a large sum of
      money, and this was expended in books.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Edward's home was now with a man who regarded money as
      the chief end and aim of life, and severe and constant
      physical labor as the only means of obtaining that end. For
      two years Edward struggled with his hopeless condition,
      toiling early and late to obtain a livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Edward now resolved to go to the city, to seek some
      employment, better adapted to promote his education. He
      entered the same store where he purchased the books, and
      inquired for Mr. Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is engaged," replied the polite clerk. "If you will wait
      a moment, he will be at liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      18. "Did you wish to see me?" asked Mr. Harris of the boy,
      whose thoughts were so intense that he had not noticed the
      approach of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Harris!" exclaimed Edward, and it was all he could say.
      For the remembrance of past favors bestowed on him by his
      kind benefactor, so filled his heart with gratitude, that
      further utterance was denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My noble Edward!" said the old gentleman. "And so you needed
      a friend. Well, you shall have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Five years from that time, Edward Delong was the
      confidential clerk of Mr. Harris, and, in three more, a
      partner in the firm. The integrity of purpose, which first
      won the regard of his benefactor, was his guide in after
      life. Prosperity crowned his efforts, and happiness blessed
      his heart,&mdash;the never-failing result of <i>faithfulness
      in little things</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Why did Edward Delong wish to see Mr.
      Harris? 2. Had he overpaid for the books he purchased? 3.
      What did he say when Mr. Harris told him he deserved a
      recompense? 4. What books were not charged in the bill? 5. In
      what way did Mr. Harris manifest his approval of Edward's
      conduct? 6. How long after this, before he again called on
      Mr. Harris? 7. Why could he not, at first, talk with Mr.
      Harris? 8. What did Edward finally become?

    <h4>
      CHASE OF THE PET FAWN.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      MISS COOPER.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Within twenty years from the foundation of our village',
      [Footnote: Cooperstown, New York.] the deer had already
      become scarce', and', in a brief period later', they had
      almost entirely fled from the country`. One of the last of
      these beautiful creatures, a pretty little fawn, had been
      brought in from the woods, when it was very young, and had
      been nursed and petted by a young lady in the village, until
      it became completely domesticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It was graceful, as those little creatures always are, and
      so gentle and playful that it became a great favorite.
      Following the different members of the family about, it was
      caressed and welcomed everywhere. One morning, after
      gamboling about as usual, until weary, it threw itself down
      in the sunshine, at the feet of one of its friends, upon the
      door-step of a store.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There came along a countryman, who, for several years, had
      been a hunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds,
      one of which came to the village with him, on this occasion.
      The dog, as it approached the place where the fawn lay,
      suddenly stopped; the little animal saw him, and darted to
      its feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. It had lived more than half its life among the villagers,
      and had apparently lost all fear of them; but it now seemed
      to know instinctively that an enemy was at hand. In an
      instant, its whole character and appearance seemed changed;
      all its past habits were forgotten; every wild impulse was
      awake; its head erect, its nostrils dilated, its eyes
      flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. In another instant, before the spectators had thought of
      the danger, and before its friends could secure it, the fawn
      was leaping wildly through the street, and the hound in full
      chase. The by-standers were eager to save it; several persons
      instantly followed its track; the friends who had long fed
      and fondled it, were calling the name it had hitherto known;
      but, in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The hunter endeavored to call back his dog; but, with no
      better success. In half a minute, the fawn had turned the
      first corner, dashed onward toward the lake, and thrown
      itself into the water. But, if, for a moment, the startled
      creature believed itself safe in the lake, it was soon
      undeceived; for the hound followed in hot and eager chase,
      while a dozen village dogs joined in the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. A large crowd collected on the bank&mdash;men, women, and
      children,&mdash;anxious for the fate of the little animal.
      Some threw themselves into boats, hoping to intercept the
      hound before he reached his prey. But the splashing of the
      oars, the voices of men and boys, and the barking of the
      dogs, must have filled the beating heart of the poor fawn
      with terror and anguish; as if every creature on the spot
      where it had once been caressed and fondled, had suddenly
      turned into a deadly foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It was soon seen that the fawn was directing its course
      across a bay, toward the nearest borders of the forest.
      Immediately the owner of the hound crossed the bridge, ran at
      full speed in the same direction, hoping to stop his dog as
      he landed. On swam the fawn, as it had never swam before; its
      delicate head scarcely seen above the water, but leaving a
      disturbed track which betrayed its course alike to anxious
      friends and fierce enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. As it approached the land, the interest became intense.
      The hunter was already on the same side of the lake, calling
      loudly and angrily to his dog; but the animal seemed to have
      quite forgotten his master's voice in the pitiless pursuit.
      The fawn touched the land; in one leap, it had crossed the
      narrow piece of beach, and, in another instant, it would
      reach the cover of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The hound followed true to the scent, aiming at the same
      spot on the shore. His master, anxious to meet him, had run
      at full speed, and was now coming up at the same critical
      moment. Would the dog listen to his voice? Could the hunter
      reach him in time to seize and control him? A shout from the
      spectators proclaimed that the fawn had passed out of sight
      into the forest. At the same instant, the hound, as he
      touched the land, felt the hunter's strong arm clutching his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The worst was believed to be over; the fawn was leaping
      up the mountain-side, and its enemy restrained. The other
      dogs, seeing their leader cowed, were easily managed. A
      number of men and boys dispersed themselves through the wood
      in search of the little creature; but, without success. They
      all returned to the village, reporting that the animal had
      not been seen by them. Some persons thought that, after its
      fright had passed over, it would return of its own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. It wore a pretty collar with its owner's name engraved
      upon it, so that it could be easily known from any other
      fawn, that might be straying about the woods. Before many
      hours had passed, a hunter presented himself before the lady,
      whose pet the little creature had been, and showed a collar
      with her name upon it. He said that he was out hunting in the
      morning, and saw a fawn in the distance. The little creature,
      instead of bounding away as he expected, moved toward him. He
      took aim, fired, and shot it to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. When he found the collar about its neck, he was very
      sorry he had killed it. One would have thought that that
      terrible chase would have made it afraid of man; but no;
      <i>it forgot the evil</i>, and <i>remembered the kindness
      only</i>; and came to meet, as a friend, the hunter who shot
      it. It was long mourned by its best friend.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Where did the lady reside who kept this
      pet fawn? 2. Is there a lake near that village? 3. What river
      rises in that lake? 4. Describe the chase of the pet fawn. 5.
      How came it to be shot? 6. What did it forget, and what
      remember?

      KINDNESS.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      KATE CLARENCE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Not <i>man</i> alone, but <i>every thing</i> in nature,
      owns its influence. I knew a little flower that sprang up
      amidst the weeds and brambles of a long-neglected garden; but
      soon drooped its slender stem, and its leaves grew tinged
      from the waste around.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I took it to my home, supported its drooping stem, and
      placed it where the warm sunshine and refreshing showers
      cheered its little life. Again it raised its beautiful head,
      and its delicate buds burst forth in gladness; and when the
      winds of autumn came, the dying flower gave up to me its
      golden seeds&mdash;a thankful tribute for my love. 'Twas a
      little thing, but <i>kindness</i> did the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There came to my casement, one winter's morning, a
      shivering, starving bird, and perched itself there, striving
      to tell its tale of suffering; but feeble were its plaintive
      notes, and its glossy breast was ruffled in the blast. I
      raised the window. Affrighted, the little wanderer spread its
      wings, as if to soar away; but, weak and faint, it sank
      fluttering in my outstretched hands. I drew it in. Alarmed,
      it darted round and round the room, and beat against the
      frosted pane. <i>O Cruelty! thou hast taught even the little
      birds to doubt!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. When the little stranger grew less timid, I gave it clear
      water, and tempting food, and so, for many weeks, we dwelt
      together; but when came the first warm, sunny day, I opened
      my doors, and it flew away,&mdash;<i>away up, up</i> into the
      dark-blue heavens, till it was lost to my eager gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. But not an hour had passed, ere I heard the flutter of its
      tiny wings, and saw, without, its little breast glittering in
      the golden sunbeams. It had a joyous life. No wired cage
      restrained its restless wing; but, free as the summer cloud,
      would it come each day, and gladly would my delighted soul
      drink in the silvery notes of its gladdening melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. And it is not <i>birds</i> and <i>flowers</i> alone, that,
      treated with kindness flourish so brightly 'neath its
      heaven-born rays. Individuals, families, nations, attest its
      truth. <i>Legal suasion</i> may frighten to compliance, but
      <i>moral suasion</i> rules the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To the erring wanderer, in the by and forbidden paths of
      sin, with a heart paled in darkness, and lost to every better
      feeling of his nature, one little word, one little act of
      kindness, however slight, will find a sunny resting-place in
      that sinful shade, and prove a light to guide the wayward one
      to holier and better deeds. The lion licked the hand that
      drew the thorn from his wounded foot; and Powhatan stayed the
      descending club, when the burning lips of the Indian girl
      pressed the prisoner's [Footnote: Captain Smith] pallid brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. And it is <i>ever</i> thus. There beats not a heart,
      however debased by sin, or darkened by sorrow, that has not
      its noblest impulses aroused, in view of a <i>generous and
      kindly action</i>. The Holy Father implanted His own pure
      principles in the breast of <i>every one</i>, and widely do
      we deviate from their just dictates, when an unkind word, or
      an unkind act, wounds a broken heart, or crushes a loving,
      gentle nature.
    </p>
    <pre>
9. "<i>Speak not harshly</i>,&mdash;much of care
    Every human heart must bear;
    Enough of shadows rudely play
    Around the very sunniest way;
    Enough of sorrows darkly lie
    Vailed within the merriest eye.
    By thy childhood's gushing tears,
    By thy grief in after years,
    By the anguish thou dost know,
<i>Add not to another's woe.</i>
10. "<i>Speak not harshly</i>,&mdash;much of sin
     Dwelleth every heart within;
     In its closely caverned cells,
     Many a wayward passion dwells.
     By the many hours misspent,
     By the gifts to error lent,
     By the wrongs thou didst not shun,
     By the good thou hast not done,
     With a lenient spirit scan
     The weakness of thy brother man."

    <h4>
      WEBSTER AND THE WOODCHUCK.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      BOSTON TRAVELER.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Ebenezer Webster, the father of Daniel, was a farmer. The
      vegetables in his garden had suffered considerably from the
      depredations of a woodchuck, which had his hole or habitation
      near the premises. Daniel, some ten or twelve years old, and
      his older brother Ezekiel, had set a trap, and finally
      succeeded in capturing the trespasser.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Ezekiel proposed to kill the animal, and end, at once, all
      further trouble from him; but Daniel looked with compassion
      upon his meek, dumb captive, and offered to let him again go
      free. The boys could not agree, and they appealed to their
      father to decide the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. "Well, my boys," said the old gentleman, "<i>I</i> will be
      the <i>judge</i>. There is the <i>prisoner</i>, (pointing to
      the wood-chuck,) and <i>you</i> shall be the <i>counsel</i>,
      and plead the case <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> his life and
      liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Ezekiel opened the case with a strong argument, urging the
      mischievous nature of the criminal, the great harm he had
      already done; said that much time and labor had been spent in
      his capture, and now, if he were suffered to live and go
      again at large, he would renew his depredations, and be
      cunning enough not to suffer himself to be caught again.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. He urged, further, that his skin was of some value, and
      that, to make the most of him they could, it would not repay
      half the damage he had already done. His argument was ready,
      practical, to the point, and of much greater length than our
      limits will allow us to occupy in relating the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The father looked with pride upon his son, who became a
      distinguished jurist in his manhood. "Now, Daniel, it is
      <i>your</i> turn: I'll hear what <i>you</i> have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It was his first case. Daniel saw that the plea of his
      brother had sensibly affected his father, the judge; and as
      his large, brilliant, black eyes looked upon the soft, timid,
      expression of the animal, and he saw it tremble with fear in
      its narrow prison-house, his heart swelled with pity, and he
      urged, with eloquent words, that the captive might again go
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "God," he said, "had made the woodchuck; he made him to
      live, to enjoy the bright sunlight, the pure air, the free
      fields and woods. God had not made him, or <i>any</i> thing,
      in vain; the woodchuck had as much right to life as any
      <i>other</i> living thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "He was not a destructive animal, as the wolf and the fox
      were; he simply ate a few common vegetables, of which they
      had plenty, and could well spare a part; he destroyed nothing
      except the little food he needed to sustain his humble life;
      and that little food was as sweet to him, and as necessary to
      his existence, as was to them the food upon their mother's
      table."
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "God furnished to them food; he gave them all they
      possessed; and would they not spare a little for the dumb
      creature, that really had as much right to his small share of
      God's bounty, as they themselves had to their portion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "Yea, more, the animal had never violated the laws of his
      nature or the laws of God, as man often did; but strictly
      followed the simple, harmless instincts he had received from
      the hand of the Creator of all things. Created by God's hand,
      he had a right&mdash;a right from God&mdash;to life, to food,
      to liberty; and they had no right to deprive him of either."
    </p>
    <p>
      12. He alluded to the mute, but earnest pleadings of the
      animal for that life, as sweet, as dear to him, as their own
      was to them, and the just judgment they might expect, if, in
      selfish cruelty and cold heartlessness, they took the life
      they could not restore&mdash;the life that God alone had
      given.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. During this appeal, the tears had started to the old
      man's eyes, and were fast running down his sun-burnt cheeks;
      every feeling of a father's heart was stirred within him; he
      saw the future greatness of his son before his eyes, he felt
      that God had blessed him in his children, beyond the lot of
      most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. His pity and sympathy were awakened by the eloquent words
      of compassion, and the strong appeal for mercy; and,
      forgetting the judge in the man and father, he sprang from
      his chair, (while Daniel was in the midst of his argument,
      without thinking he had already won his case,) and, turning
      to his older son, dashing the tears from his eyes, exclaimed,
      "<i>Ezekiel, Ezekiel, you let that woodchuck go!</i>"
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What did Ezekiel propose to do with the
      woodchuck after he was caught? 2. What argument did he offer
      for so doing? 3. What did Daniel wish to do with him? 4. What
      argument did he offer? 4. What was their father's decision?

    <h4>
      DO IT YOURSELF.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. Do not ask the teacher or some classmate to solve that
      hard problem. DO IT YOURSELF. You might as well let him eat
      your dinner as "do your sums" for you. It is in studying as
      in eating; <i>he who does it</i>, gets the benefit, and not
      <i>he who sees it done</i>. In almost any school, the teacher
      learns more than the best scholars, simply because he is
      compelled to solve all the difficult problems, and answer all
      the questions of the indolent pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Do not ask your teacher to parse that difficult word, or
      assist you in the performance of any of your studies. DO IT
      YOURSELF. Never mind, though they <i>do</i> look dark. Do not
      ask even a hint from any one. TRY AGAIN. Every trial
      increases your ability, and you will finally succeed by dint
      of the very wisdom and strength gained in the effort, even
      though, at first, the problem was beyond your skill. It is
      the <i>study</i>, and not the <i>answer</i>, that really
      rewards your labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Look at that boy, who has just succeeded after six hours
      of hard study. How his large eye is lit up with a proud joy,
      as he marches to his class! He treads like a conqueror! And
      well he may. Last night his lamp burned, and this morning he
      waked at dawn. Once or twice he nearly gave it up. He had
      tried his last thought; but a new thought strikes him, and he
      ponders the last process. He tries once more, and succeeds;
      and now mark the air of conscious strength with which he
      pronounces his demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. His poor, weak schoolmate, who gave up that same problem,
      after his first trial, now looks up to him with something of
      a wonder, as a superior being. And he <i>is</i> his superior.
      That problem lies there, a great gulf between those boys who
      stood side by side yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The boy who <i>did it for himself</i>, has taken a stride
      upward, and what is better still, <i>has gained strength</i>
      to take other and better ones. The boy who waited to see
      <i>others do it</i>, has lost both strength and courage, and
      is already looking for some good excuse to give up school and
      study forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. DO IT YOURSELF. Remember the counsel given to the artist,
      who lay reclining upon his couch, and wondering what the
      fates would work out for him. Directing his attention to a
      block of unhewn marble, with a chisel lying by its side, the
      sculptor in the vision is represented as thus addressing him:
      "Sir,
    </p>
    <pre>
  "There's the marble, there's the chisel,
    Take it, work it to thy will;
<i>Thou alone</i> must shape thy future,
    Heaven send thee strength and skill!"
</pre>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Who is benefited in studying? 2. What
      really rewards the labor of study? 3. What is said of the boy
      who succeeded after six hours of hard study? 4. What, of the
      boy who gave up, after the first trial? 5. What counsel was
      given to the artist who wondered what the fates would work

1. <i>Life is a race</i>, where some succeed,
      While others are beginning;
   'Tis luck, at times, at others, speed,

   Remember, though you are surpassed,
<i>'Tis better late than never!</i>
3. Ne'er labor for an idle boast
     Of victory o'er another;
   But, while you strive your uttermost,
     Deal fairly with a brother.
   Whate'er your station, do your best,
     And, hold your purpose ever;
   And, if you fail to beat the rest,
<i>'Tis better late than never!</i>
4. Choose well the path in which you run,&mdash;
     Succeed by noble daring;
   Then, though the last, when once 'tis won,
     Your crown is worth the wearing.
   Then never fret, if left behind,
     Nor slacken your endeavor;
   But ever keep this truth in mind:
<i>'Tis better late than never!</i>
 5. Yet, would you cure this sad defect,
      Repining's unavailing;
    Begin, <i>at once</i>, and <i>now</i> correct
      This very common failing.
<i>This day</i> resolve,&mdash;<i>this very hour,</i>

    <h4>
      THE OLD EAGLE TREE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      REV. JOHN TODD.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In a remote field stood a large tulip tree, apparently of
      a century's growth, and one of the most gigantic of that
      splendid species. It looked like the father of the
      surrounding forest. A single tree, of huge dimensions,
      standing all alone, is a sublime object.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the
      "Fishing Eagle," had built her nest every year, for many
      years, and, unmolested, raised her young. What is remarkable,
      as she procured her food from the ocean, this tree stood full
      ten miles from the sea-shore. It had long been known as the
      "Old Eagle tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an
      adjoining field. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle
      was known to set off for the sea-side, to gather food for her
      young. As she this day returned with a large fish in her
      claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by yelling, and
      hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that
      she dropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The men soon dispersed; but Joseph sat down under a bush
      near by, to watch, and to bestow unavailing pity. The bird
      soon returned to her nest without food. The eaglets at once
      set up a cry for food, so shrill, so clear, and so clamorous,
      that the boy was greatly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their
      appetites were too keen, and it was all in vain. She then
      perched herself on a limb near them, and looked down into the
      nest with a look that seemed to say, "I know not what to do
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Her indecision was but momentary; again she poised
      herself, uttered one or two sharp notes, as if telling them
      to "lie still," balanced her body, spread her wings, and was
      away again for the sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Joseph was determined to see the result. His eyes followed
      her till she grew small, smaller,&mdash;a mere speck in the
      sky,&mdash;and then disappeared. What boy has not often
      watched the flight of the bird of his country in this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      8. She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time
      for a voyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing,
      flying uncommonly low, in order to have a heavier atmosphere
      to sustain her, with another fish in her talons.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. On nearing the field, she made a circuit around it, to see
      if her enemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she
      once more reached her tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and
      evidently nearly exhausted. Again the eaglets set up their
      cry, which was soon hushed by the distribution of a dinner,
      such as&mdash;save the cooking&mdash;a king might admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "GLORIOUS BIRD!" cried the boy in ecstacy, and aloud;
      "what a spirit! Other birds can fly swifter, others can sing
      more sweetly, others can scream more loudly; but what
      <i>other bird</i>, when persecuted and robbed&mdash;when
      weary &mdash;when discouraged&mdash;when so far from
      sea,&mdash;would have done this!
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "GLORIOUS BIRD! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I
      will never forget hereafter, that when the spirit is
      determined, it can do almost anything. Others would have
      drooped and hung the head, and mourned over the cruelty of
      man, and sighed over the wants of the nestlings; but
      <i>thou,</i> by at once recovering the loss, hast forgotten
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. "I will learn of thee, <i>noble bird!</i> I will remember
      this. I will set my mark high. I will try to do something,
      and to be something in the world; <i>I will never yield to
      discouragements."</i>
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. How far was this Old Eagle tree from the
      seashore? 2. In what way did the workmen obtain the fish she
      brought for her young? 3. What is said of the eaglets and the
      parent bird, when she returned to the nest? 4. What did she
      then do? 5. What did Joseph say when she returned with
      another fish?

    <h4>
      THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      ELIHU BURRITT.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Knowledge can not be stolen from you. It can not be bought
      or sold. You may be <i>poor</i>, and the sheriff come into
      your house, and sell your furniture at auction, or drive away
      your cow, or take your lamb, and leave you homeless and
      penniless; but he can not lay the law's hand upon the
      <i>jewelry of your mind</i>. This can not be taken for debt;
      neither can you <i>give it away</i>, though you give enough
      of it to fill a million minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I will tell you what such giving is like. Suppose, now,
      that there were no sun nor stars in the heavens, nor any
      thing that shone in the black brow of night; and suppose that
      a lighted lamp were put into your hand, which should burn
      wasteless and clear amid all the tempests that should brood
      upon this lower world.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Suppose next, that there were a thousand millions of human
      beings on the earth with you, each holding in his hand an
      unlighted lamp, filled with the same oil as yours, and
      capable of giving as much light. Suppose these millions
      should come, one by one, to you, and light each his lamp by
      yours, would they rob you of any light? Would less of it
      shine on your own path? Would your lamp burn more dimly for
      lighting a thousand millions?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Thus it is, young friends. In getting rich in the things
      which perish with the using, men have often obeyed to the
      letter that first commandment of selfishness: <i>"Keep what
      you can get, and get what you can."</i> In filling your minds
      with the wealth of knowledge, you must reverse this rule, and
      obey this law: <i>"Keep what you give, and give what you
      can."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The fountain of knowledge is filled by its <i>outlets,</i>
      not by its inlets. You can <i>learn</i> nothing which you do
      not <i>teach;</i> you can acquire nothing of intellectual
      wealth, except by <i>giving.</i> In the illustration of the
      lamps, which I have given you, was not the light of the
      thousands of millions which were lighted at yours, as much
      your light, as if it all came from your solitary lamp? Did
      you not dispel darkness by giving away light?
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Remember this parable, and, whenever you fall in with an
      unlighted mind in your walk of life, drop a kind and glowing
      thought upon it from yours, and set it a-burning in the world
      with a light that shall shine in some dark place to beam on
      the benighted.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is said of knowledge? 2. What is the
      giving of knowledge like? 3. In getting rich, what precept
      have men obeyed? 4. What precept must be obeyed in getting
      knowledge? 5. How is knowledge best acquired? 6. What is
      meant by the <i>jewelry of the mind,</i> first paragraph? 7.
      What, by <i>intellectual wealth,</i> fifth paragraph?

    <h4>
      NIGHT'S LESSONS.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      L.H. SIGOURNEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The lessons of our school are over. The lights in the
      distant windows are extinguished, one after the other. The
      village will soon be lost in slumber. When all the men and
      the women are asleep, must we keep awake to learn lessons?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In large cities, there may be heard, now and then, the
      rushing wheel of the traveler. The watchmen pace their round,
      and cry, <i>"All is well."</i> In the long, cold nights of
      Norway, the watchmen who guard the capitol, pronounce, in a
      solemn tone, "God bless our good city of Bergen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In the garrison, or the endangered fortress, the armed
      sentinel keeps watch, lest they should be surprised by the
      foe. But in this peaceful village there is no need of either
      sentinel or watchman. Why may we not go to sleep, instead of
      learning Night's lessons?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. My son, one of these you may learn in a moment. Did you
      say that all will soon be sleeping? No! there is one Eye that
      never slumbers. He who made all the people, keepeth watch
      above the everlasting hills. Commit yourself to His care.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Now, will you learn with me the second lesson of the
      night? Lift your eyes to yon glorious canopy. Seest thou not
      there a sentinel, set by the Eternal, at the northern gate of
      heaven,&mdash;the pole-star?
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The pole-star! Blessings are breathed upon it, by the
      weary caravan, fearing the poisonous wind of the
      desert,&mdash;by the red forest-children, seeking their home
      beyond the far Western prairies,&mdash;and by the lonely
      mariner, upon the pathless ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The stars! See them! The oil in their lamps never burns
      out. These glorious constellations wheel their mighty course
      unchanged, while "man dieth and wasteth away, yea, man giveth
      up the ghost, and where is he?" [Footnote: Job, 14th chap.,
      10th verse.]
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Yon brilliant orbs maintain their places, while countless
      generations pass away, and nations disappear and are
      forgotten. Let us bow in humility before "Him who bringeth
      out their host by number, who calleth them all by names, by
      the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power;
      not one faileth." [Footnote: Isaiah. 40th chap., 26th verse.]
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Thirteen times in the year, Night, the teacher, gives
      extra lessons. Will you be there to learn them? First, she
      hangs up a pale crescent in the west. The ancient Jews hailed
      its infant beam, and answering fires of joy were kindled on
      the hills of Palestine.[Headnote 1]
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Next, she summons forth a rounded orb, clad in full
      effulgence, and commits to it the regency when the sun
      retires. Lastly, a slender, waning crescent appears nightly,
      like an aged man, ready to descend into the night of the
      tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.<br>
       "Soon as the evening shades prevail,<br>
       The moon takes up the wondrous tale,<br>
       And nightly to the listening earth,<br>
       Repeats the story of her birth;<br>
       While all the stars that round her burn,<br>
       And all the planets in their turn,<br>
       Confirm the tidings as they roll,<br>
       And spread the truth from pole to pole."
    </p>
    <p>
      12. These are some of Night's lessons. Are you tired of them?
      Or, will you learn one more? Lift up your heart to Him who
      has given you the past day, with thanks for its
      blessings,&mdash;with penitence for its faults,&mdash;with
      supplication for strength and wisdom for the time that is to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
      showeth knowledge" [Footnote: Psalm 19th, 2nd verse.] of God.
      Thus, meekly and faithfully studying Night's lessons, may we
      find
    </p>
    <pre>
  "Even sorrow, touched by Heaven, grows bright
    With more than rapture's ray,
  As darkness shows us worlds of light,
    We never saw by day."

   Looking down so calm and tender

   Though thy spirit yearneth sky-ward,

   I, who chant at heaven's portal,
       Build my nest on earth.
FIRST VOICE.
4. River! river'! singing gayly
   From the hill-side all day long,
   Teach my heart the merry music
   Of thy cheery, rippling song.
SECOND VOICE.
   Many winding ways I follow;
   Yet, at length, I reach the sea.

    <h4>
      A THRILLING INCIDENT.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      ANON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Our noble ship lay at anchor in the Bay of Tangier, a
      fortified town in the extreme northwest of Africa. The day
      had been extremely mild, with a gentle breeze sweeping to the
      northward and westward; but, toward the close of the
      afternoon, the sea-breeze died away, and one of those sultry,
      oven-like breathings came from the great, sun-burnt Sahara
      [Headnote 1].
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Half an hour before sundown, the captain gave the cheering
      order for the boatswain to call the hands to "go in
      swimming;" and, in less than five minutes, the forms of our
      tars were seen leaping from the arms of the lower yards, into
      the water. One of the studding sails, with its corners
      suspended from the main yard-arm and the swinging boom, had
      been lowered into the water, and into this most of the
      swimmers made their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Among those who seemed to be enjoying the sport most
      heartily, were two of the boys, Timothy Wallace and Frederic
      Fairbanks, the latter of whom was the son of our old gunner;
      and, in a laughing mood, they started out from the studding
      sail on a race. There was a loud ringing shout of joy on
      their lips as they put off, and they darted through the water
      like fishes. The surface of the sea was smooth as glass,
      though its bosom rose in long, heavy swells that set in from
      the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The vessel was moored with a long sweep from both cables,
      and one of the buoys of the anchor was far away on the
      starboard quarter, where it rose and fell with the lazy
      swells of the waves. Toward this buoy the two lads made their
      way, young Fairbanks taking the lead; but, when they were
      within about twenty or thirty fathoms of the buoy, Wallace
      shot ahead and promised to win the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The old gunner had watched the progress of his little son
      with a great degree of pride; and when he saw him drop
      behind, he leaped upon the quarter-deck, and was just upon
      the point of urging him on by a shout, when a cry was heard
      that struck him with instant horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "<i>A shark! a shark!</i>" was sounded from the captain of
      the forecastle; and, at the sound of these terrible words,
      the men who were in the water, leaped and plunged toward the
      ship. Right abeam, at the distance of three or four cables'
      lengths, was seen the wake of a shark in the water, where the
      back of the monster was visible. His course was for the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. For a moment, the gunner stood like one bereft of reason;
      but, on the next, he shouted at the top of his voice, for the
      boys to turn; but they heard him not. Stoutly the two
      swimmers strove for the goal, all unconscious of their
      imminent danger. Their merry laugh still rang over the
      waters, and, at length, they both touched the buoy together.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Oh, what agony filled the heart of the gunner! A boat had
      put off, but he knew that it could not reach the boys in
      season, and every moment he expected to see the monster sink
      from sight,&mdash;<i>then</i> he knew that all hope would be
      gone. At this moment, a cry reached the ship, that pierced
      every heart,&mdash;the boys had discovered their enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The cry started the old gunner to his senses, and quicker
      than thought, he sprang from the quarter-deck. The guns were
      all loaded and shotted, fore and aft, and none knew their
      temper better than he. With steady hand, made strong by
      sudden hope, the old gunner seized a priming-wire and picked
      the cartridge of one of the quarter guns; then he took from
      his pocket a percussion cap, fixed it in its place, and set
      back the hammer of the patent lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. With a giant strength the old man swayed the breech of
      the heavy gun to its bearing, and then seizing the string of
      the lock, he stood back and watched for the next swell that
      would bring the shark in range. He had aimed the piece some
      distance ahead of his mark; but yet a little moment would
      settle his hopes and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Every breath was hushed, and every heart in that old ship
      beat painfully. The boat was yet some distance from the boys,
      while the horrid sea-monster was fearfully near. Suddenly the
      air was rent by the roar of the heavy gun; and, as the old
      man knew his shot was gone, he sank back upon the hatch, and
      covered his face with his hands, as if afraid to see the
      result of his own efforts; for, if he had failed, he knew
      that his boy was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. For a moment after the report of the gun had died away
      upon the air, there was an unbroken silence; but, as the
      dense smoke arose from the surface of the water, there was,
      at first, a low murmur breaking from the lips of the
      men,&mdash;that murmur grew louder and stronger, till it
      swelled to a joyous, deafening shout. The old gunner sprang
      to his feet, and gazed off on the water, and the first thing
      that met his view, was the huge carcass of the shark,
      floating on his back&mdash;a mangled, lifeless mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. In a few moments, the boats reached the daring swimmers,
      and, greatly frightened, they were brought on board. The old
      man clasped his boy in his arms, and then, overcome by the
      powerful excitement, he leaned upon a gun for support. I have
      seen men in all the phases of excitement and suspense, but
      never have I seen three human beings more overcome by
      thrilling emotions, than on that startling moment when they
      first knew the effect of our gunner's shot.

    <h4>
      THE TRUTHFUL KING.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. A certain Persian king, while traveling in disguise, with
      but few attendants, was waylaid by robbers, who threatened to
      take not only his goods, but his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Feeling himself beyond the reach of human aid, he inwardly
      made a vow, that if God would incline the hearts of these
      ruffians to mercy, and restore him in safety to his family
      and people, he would distribute all the money then in his
      treasury, in alms to the needy of his realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The robbers, from some unknown cause, liberated him, and
      he soon reached home in safety, having sustained no injury,
      save the loss of the small purse of gold that he had carried
      in his girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Desirous of keeping the vow he had made, he summoned his
      officers, and commanded them to make immediate distribution
      to the poor, of all that the treasury contained, at the time
      of his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. But his officers, more miserly than himself, and, fearful
      that they might fall short in their salaries and pensions,
      began to urge upon the monarch the folly of keeping this rash
      vow, and the danger of thus involving himself and his kingdom
      in difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Finding he still remained firm, they took other grounds,
      and plausibly argued that the troops and other officials
      needed aid as well as the poor; and, as by the <i>words</i>
      of his vow, he had bound himself to distribute the contents
      of the treasury to those who had claim to relief, the public
      servants certainly came within the required limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Bewildered by their false logic, and sincerely desirous of
      doing right, he appealed to a certain sage who dwelt near the
      royal palace, and determined to abide by his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The sage, after hearing the case, only asked the following
      simple question: "Of whom were you thinking when you made the
      vow,&mdash;the poor, or the public servants?" The monarch
      replied, "Of the poor." "Then," answered the sage, "it is to
      the <i>poor</i> you are bound to distribute these funds; for
      you are not <i>really</i> fulfilling your vow, unless you do
      that which you intended to do when it was made." The king was
      satisfied that this was the right decision, and did as the
      sage advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Let the young bear in mind that God is a being of truth,
      requiring truth in the inward heart; and, if they would have
      His approval, and that of their own consciences, they must
      avoid not only the <i>outward</i> appearance of falsehood,
      but the slightest evasion or deceit; and when promises have
      been made, fulfill not only the <i>letter</i>, but the
      <i>spirit</i> of that which they agreed to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Beware of the first and slightest departure from truth,
      of the least endeavor to deceive, and even of the desire to
      have others believe what is not so. Let your motto be,
      <i>"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
      truth."</i>
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What happened to a certain Persian king?
      2. What vow did he then make? 3. What objection did his
      officers make to this? 4. What did the king then do? 5. What

      But in <i>useful learning</i>.
 4. As your years attain
      Life's meridian brightness,
    Hourly seek and gain
<i>Genuine politeness:</i>
    This lives not in forms,
      As too many teach us,&mdash;
    Not in open arms,
      Not in silken speeches,
 5. Not in haughty eye,
      Not in artful dealing,
    Not within the sigh
      Of a mimicked feeling:
    But its lights preside
      Rich in nature's splendor,
    Over honest pride,
      Gentleness and candor.
 6. Slight ye not the soul
      For the frame's demerit;
    Oft a shattered bowl
      Holds a mighty spirit:
    Never search a breast
      By thy ruby's glances;
    Pomp's a puppet guest,
      Danced by circumstances.
 7. What is good and great,
      Sense can soon determine;
    Prize it though ye meet,
      Or in rags or ermine.
    Fortune's truly blind;
      Fools may be her captors;
    But the <i>wealth of mind</i>
      Stands above their scepters.
 8. Value not the lips
      Swiftest kept in motion,
    Fleetly-sailing ships
      Draw no depth of ocean:
    Snatch the chary gleam,
      From the cautious knowing
    For the deepest stream
      Scarcely lisps 'tis flowing.
 9. Cull from bad and good
      Every seeming flower,
    Store it up as food
      For some hungry hour:
    Press its every leaf,
      And remember, Johnny,
    Even weeds the chief
      May have drops of honey.
10. Pomp and power alone
      Never make a blessing;
    Seek not e'en a throne
      By one wretch distressing.
    Better toil a slave
      For the blood-earned penny,
    Than be rich, and have
      A curse on every guinea.
11. Think, my gentle boys,
      Every man a brother!
<i>That's where honor lies,</i>
      Nay, but <i>greatness</i> rather:
    One's the mystic whole,
      Lordly flesh won't know it;
    But the kingly soul,
      Sees but vice below it.
12. Robert, thoughts like these,
      Store you more than money;
    Read them not to please,
      But to practice, Johnny.
    Artless though their dress,
      As an infant's dimple,
<i>Truth is none the less</i>
<i>For being truly simple.</i>

    <h4>
      WHANG, THE MILLER.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      GOLDSMITH.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Whang, the miller, was naturally avaricious; nobody loved
      money better than he, or more respected those that had it.
      When people would talk of a rich man in company, Whang would
      say, "<i>I</i> know him very well, <i>he</i> and <i>I</i>
      have been very long acquainted; <i>he</i> and <i>I</i> are
      intimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. But, if a poor man was mentioned, he had not the least
      knowledge of the man; he might be very well, for aught
      <i>he</i> knew; but he was not fond of making many
      acquaintances, and loved to choose his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Whang, however, with all his eagerness for riches, was
      poor. He had nothing but the profits of his mill to support
      him; but, though these were small, they were certain: while
      it stood and went, he was sure of eating; and his frugality
      was such, that he, every day, laid some money by; which he
      would, at intervals, count and contemplate with much
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Yet still his acquisitions were not equal to his desires;
      he only found himself above want; whereas he desired to be
      possessed of affluence. One day, as he was indulging these
      wishes, he was informed that a neighbor of his had found a
      pan of money under ground, having dreamed of it three nights
      in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. These tidings were daggers to the heart of poor Whang.
      "Here am I," said he, "toiling and moiling from morning till
      night for a few paltry farthings, while neighbor Thanks only
      goes quietly to bed, and dreams himself into thousands before
      morning. Oh, that I could dream like him! With what pleasure
      would I dig round the pan! How slyly would I carry it home!
      Not even my wife should see me! And then, oh the pleasure of
      thrusting one's hands into a heap of gold up to the elbows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Such reflections only served to make the miller unhappy.
      He discontinued his former assiduity; he was quite disgusted
      with small gains; and his customers began to forsake him.
      Every day he repeated the wish, and every night laid himself
      down in order to dream. Fortune, that was for a long time
      unkind, at last, however, seemed to smile upon his distress,
      and indulged him with the wished-for vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. He dreamed that under a certain part of the foundation of
      his mill, there was concealed a monstrous pan of gold and
      diamonds, buried deep in the ground, and covered with a large
      flat stone. He concealed his good luck from every person, as
      is usual in money-dreams, in order to have the vision
      repeated the two succeeding nights, by which he should be
      certain of its truth. His wishes in this, also, were
      answered; he still dreamed of the same pan of money, in the
      very same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Now, therefore, it was past a doubt; so, getting up early
      the third morning, he repaired, alone, with a mattock in his
      hand, to the mill, and began to undermine that part of the
      wall to which the vision directed. The first omen of success
      that he met with, was a broken ring; digging still deeper, he
      turned up a house-tile, quite new and entire.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. At last, after much digging, he came to a broad flat
      stone; but then it was so large, that it was beyond his
      strength to remove it. "<i>There</i>," cried he in raptures
      to himself, "<i>there it is!</i> under this stone, there is
      room for a very large pan of diamonds indeed. I must e'en go
      home to my wife, and tell her the whole affair, and get her
      to assist me in turning it up." Away, therefore, he goes, and
      acquaints his wife with every circumstance of their good
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Her raptures, on this occasion, may easily be imagined;
      she flew round his neck, and embraced him in an agony of joy.
      But these transports, however, did not allay their eagerness
      to know the exact sum; returning, together, to the place
      where Whang had been digging, there they found&mdash;not,
      indeed, the expected treasure&mdash;but the mill, their only
      support, undermined and fallen!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Upon what was Whang, the miller,
      dependent for support? 2. Why was he not satisfied? 3. What
      did he say to himself, after the information he had received
      from a neighbor? 4. What effect had such reflections upon
      him? 5. What did he dream three nights successively? 6. What
      did he do? 7. What was the result?

    <h4>
      CHIMNEY-SWALLOWS.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      HENRY WARD BEECHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Every one knows, who lives in the country, what a
      chimney-swallow is. They are among the birds that seem to
      love the neighborhood of man. Many birds there are, that
      nestle confidingly in the protection of their superiors, and
      are seldom found nesting or breeding far from human
      habitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The wren builds close to your door. Sparrows and robins,
      if well treated, will make their nests right under your
      window, in some favorite tree, and will teach you, if you
      choose to go into the business, how to build birds' nests.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A great deal of politeness and fidelity may be learned.
      The female bird is waited upon, fed, cheered with singing,
      during her incubation, in a manner that might give lessons to
      the household. Nay, when she needs exercise and recreation,
      her husband very demurely takes her place, and keeps the eggs
      warm in the most gentlemanly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Barn-swallows have a very sensible appreciation of the
      pleasures of an ample barn. A barn might not be found quite
      the thing to live in, (although we have seen many a place
      where we would take the barn sooner than the house,) but it
      is one of the most charming places in a summer-day to lounge,
      read, or nap in.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. And, as you lie on your back upon the sweet-scented
      hay-mow, or upon clean straw thrown down on the great floor,
      reading books of natural history, it is very pleasant to see
      the flitting swallows glance in and out, or course about
      under the roof, with motion so lithe and rapid as to seem
      more like the glancing of shadows than the winging of birds.
      Their mud-nests are clean, if they <i>are</i> made of dirt;
      and you would never dream, from their feathers, what sort of
      a house they lived in.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. But, it was of <i>chimney-swallows</i> that we began to
      write; and they are just now roaring in the little, stubbed
      chimney behind us, to remind us of our duty. Every evening we
      hear them; for a nest of young ones brings the parents in
      with food, early and late, and every entrance or exit is like
      a distant roll of thunder, or like those old-fashioned
      rumblings of high winds in the chimney, which made us
      children think that all out-of-doors was coming down the
      chimney in stormy nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. These little architects build their simple nests upon the
      sides of the chimney with sticks, which they are said to
      break off from dead branches of trees, though they might more
      easily pick them up already prepared. But they, doubtless,
      have their own reasons for cutting their own timber. Then
      these are glued to the wall by a saliva which they secrete,
      so that they carry their mortar in their mouths, and use
      their bills for trowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When the young are ready to leave, they climb up the
      chimney to the top, by means of their sharp claws, aided by
      their tail-feathers, which are short, stiff, and at the end
      armed with sharp spines. Two broods are reared in a season.
      From the few which congregate in any one neighborhood, one
      would not suspect the great numbers which assemble at the end
      of the season. Audubon estimated that <i>nine thousand</i>
      entered a large sycamore-tree, every night, to roost, near
      Louisville, Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Sometimes the little nest has been slighted in building,
      or the weight proves too great, and down it comes into the
      fire-place, to the great amusement of the children, who are
      all a-fever to hold in their hands these clean, bright-eyed
      little fellows. Who would suspect that they had ever been
      bred in such a flue?
    </p>
    <p>
      10. And it was just this thought that set us to writing.
      Because a bird lives in a chimney, he need not be
      <i>smutty</i>. There is many a fine feather that lives in a
      chimney-corner. Nor are birds the <i>only</i> instances. Many
      men are born in a garret, or in a cellar, who fly out of it,
      as soon as fledged, as fine as any body. A lowly home has
      reared many high natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. On these bare sticks, right against the bricks, in this
      smoky flue, the eggs are laid, the brooding goes on, the
      young are hatched, fed, grown. But then comes the day when
      they spread the wing, and the whole heaven is theirs! From
      morning to night, they can not touch the bounds of their
      liberty!
    </p>
    <p>
      12. And, in like manner, it is with the human soul that has
      learned to know its liberty. Born in a body, pent up, and
      cramped, it seems imprisoned in a mere smoky flue for
      passions. But, when once faith has taught the soul that it
      has wings, then it begins to fly; and flying, finds that all
      God's domain is its liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. And, as the swallow that comes back to roost in its hard
      hole at night, is quite content, so that the morning gives it
      again all the bright heavens for its soaring-ground, so may
      men, close quartered and cramped in bodily accommodations, be
      quite patient of their narrow bounds, for their thoughts may
      fly out every day gloriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. And as, in autumn, these children of the chimney gather
      in flocks, and fly away to heavens without a winter, so men
      shall find a day when they, too, shall migrate; and, rising
      into a higher sphere, without storm or winter, shall remember
      the troubles of this mortal life, as birds in Florida may be
      supposed to remember the northern chills, which drove them
      forth to a fairer clime.

       If never a sad, low-spoken word

<i>Then</i>`, when the night steals on, as now,
       It will bring relief to thine aching brow,
       And, with joy and peace at the thought of rest,
       Thou wilt sink to sleep on thy mother's breast.

    <h4>
      THE RESCUE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      BY A SEA CAPTAIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. On a bright moonlight night, in the month of February,
      1831, when it was intensely cold, the little brig which I
      commanded, lay quietly at her anchors, inside of Sandy Hook.
      We had had a hard time, beating about for eleven days off
      this coast, with cutting north-easters blowing, and snow and
      sleet falling for the most part of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Forward, the vessel was thickly coated with ice, and it
      was hard work to handle her; as the rigging and sails were
      stiff, and yielded only when the strength of the men was
      exerted to the utmost. When we, at length, made the port, all
      hands were worn down and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. "A bitter cold night, Mr. Larkin," I said to my mate, as I
      tarried for a short time upon deck. The worthy down-easter
      buttoned his coat more tightly around him, and, looking up to
      the moon, replied, "It's a whistler, captain; and nothing can
      live comfortably out of blankets to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "The tide is running out swift and strong, and it will be
      well to keep a sharp look-out for this floating ice, Mr.
      Larkin," said I, as I turned to go below. "Ay, ay, sir,"
      responded the faithful mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. About two hours afterward, I was aroused from a sound
      sleep by the vigilant officer. "Excuse me for disturbing you,
      captain," said he, as he detected an expression of vexation
      in my face, "but I wish you would turn out, and come on deck
      as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "What's the matter, Mr. Larkin," said I. "Why, sir, I have
      been watching a large cake of ice, which swept by at a
      distance, a moment ago; and I saw something black upon it,
      something that I thought moved. The moon is under a cloud,
      and I could not see distinctly; but I believe there is a
      child floating out to the sea, this freezing night, on that
      cake of ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. We were on deck before either spoke another word. The mate
      pointed out, with no little difficulty, the cake of ice
      floating off to the leeward, with its white, glittering
      surface broken by a black spot. "Get the glass, Mr. Larkin,"
      said I; "the moon will be out of that cloud in a moment, and
      then we can see distinctly."
    </p>
    <p>
      8. I kept my eye upon the receding mass of ice, while the
      moon was slowly working her way through a heavy bank of
      clouds. The mate stood by me with the glass; and when the
      full light fell upon the water with a brilliancy only known
      in our northern latitudes, I put the glass to my eye. One
      glance was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. (<i>''</i>)"<i>Forward, there!</i>" I hailed at the top of
      my voice; and, with one bound, I reached the main hatch, and
      began to clear away the little cutter, which was stowed in
      the ship's yawl. Mr. Larkin had taken the glass to look for
      himself, "<i>There are two children on that cake of ice!</i>"
      he exclaimed, as he hastened to assist me in getting out the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The men answered my hail, and walked quickly aft. In a
      short space of time, we launched the cutter, into which Mr.
      Larkin and myself jumped, followed by the two men, who took
      the oars. I rigged the tiller, and the mate sat beside me in
      the stern sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "Do you see that cake of ice with something black upon
      it, my lads? Put me alongside of that, and I'll give you a
      month's extra wages when you are paid off," said I to the
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. They bent to their oars, but their strokes were uneven
      and feeble; for they were worn out by the hard duty of the
      preceding fortnight; and, though they did their best, the
      boat made little more headway than the tide. It was a losing
      chase, and Mr. Larkin, who was suffering torture as he saw
      how little we gained, cried out, "<i>Pull, lads! I'll double
      the captain's prize: two months' extra pay: pull, lads! pull
      for life!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      13. A convulsive effort at the oars told how willing the men
      were to obey; but the strength of the strong man was gone.
      One of the poor fellows washed us twice in recovering his
      oar, and then gave out; and the other was nearly as far gone.
      Mr. Larkin sprang forward and seized the deserted oar. "Lie
      down in the bottom of the boat," said he to the man; "and,
      captain, take the other oar; we must row for ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      14. I took the second man's place. Larkin had stripped off
      his coat, and, as he pulled the bow, I waited for the signal
      stroke. It came gently, but firm; and the next moment we were
      pulling a long, steady stroke; gradually increasing in
      rapidity, until the wood seemed to smoke in the row-locks. We
      kept time, each by the long, deep breathing of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Such a pull! We bent forward until our faces almost
      touched our knees; and then throwing all our strength into
      the backward movement, drew on the oar until every inch
      covered by the sweep was gained. Thus we worked at the oars
      for fifteen minutes; and it seemed to me as many hours. The
      sweat rolled off in great drops, and I was enveloped in a
      steam generated from my own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. "Are we almost up to it, Mr. Larkin?" I gasped out.
      "Almost, captain," said he: "and <i>don't give up!</i> for
      the love of our dear little ones at home: <i>don't give
      up</i>, captain!" The oars flashed as their blades turned up
      to the moonlight, for the men who plied them were fathers,
      and had fathers' hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Suddenly Mr. Larkin ceased pulling; and my heart, for a
      moment, almost stopped its beating; for the terrible thought
      that he had given out, crossed my mind. But I was re-assured
      by his voice, (<i>p</i>) "Gently, captain, gently: a stroke
      or two more: there, that will do;" and the next moment Mr.
      Larkin sprang upon the ice. I started up, and, calling to the
      men to make fast the boat to the ice, followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. We ran to the dark spot in the center of the mass, and
      found two little boys. The head of the smaller was resting in
      the bosom of the larger; and both were fast asleep. The
      lethargy, which would have been fatal but for the timely
      rescue, had overcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Mr. Larkin grasped one of the lads, cut off his shoes,
      tore off his jacket, and then, loosening his own garments to
      the skin, placed the cold child in contact with his own warm
      body, carefully wrapping his overcoat around him. I did the
      same with the other child, and we then returned to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. The children, as we learned when we had the delight of
      restoring them to their parents, were playing on the cake of
      ice, which had jammed into a bend of the river, about ten
      miles above New York. A movement of the tide set the ice in
      motion, and the little fellows were borne away, that cold
      night, and would have inevitably perished, but for Mr.
      Larkin's espying them as they were sweeping out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. "How do you feel, Mr. Larkin?" I said to the mate, the
      morning after this adventure. "A little stiff in the arms,
      captain," the noble fellow replied, while the big tears of
      grateful happiness gathered in his eyes,&mdash;"a little
      stiff in the arms, captain, but very easy here," laying his
      hand on the rough chest in which beat a true and manly heart.
      My quaint down-easter, He who lashes the seas into fury, and
      lets loose the tempest, will care for thee! The storms may
      rage without, but in <i>thy</i> bosom peace and sunshine
      abide always.
    </p>

      she lay at anchor inside Sandy Hook. 2. What did the captain
      say to Mr. Larkin, as he retired to rest? 3. Why did Mr.

    <h4>
      ROBERT BRUCE AND THE SCOTCH WOMAN.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      ANON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Many years ago, an old Scotch woman sat alone, spinning by
      the kitchen fire, in her little cottage. The room was adorned
      with the spoils of the chase, and many implements of war and
      hunting. There were spears, bows and arrows, swords, and
      shields; and, against the side of the room, hung a pair of
      huge antlers, once reared on the lordly brow of a "stag of
      ten," [Footnote: That is, a stag ten years old. The age of
      the animal is known by the number of prongs or tines, each
      year one new prong being added.] on which were suspended
      skins, plaids, bonnets, and one or two ponderous battle-axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The table, in the middle of the floor, was spread for
      supper, and some oatmeal cakes were baking before the fire.
      But the dame was not thinking of any of <i>these things</i>,
      nor of her two manly sons, who, in an adjoining room, were
      busily preparing for the next day's sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. She was thinking of the distracted state of her native
      land, and of the good king, Robert Bruce, a fugitive in his
      own kingdom, beset, on every hand, by open enemies and secret
      traitors. "Alas!" thought she, "to-night I dwell here in
      peace, while to-morrow may see me driven out into the heath;
      and even now our king is a wanderer, with no shelter for his
      weary limbs."
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A loud knock at the door broke in upon her musings. She
      rose, trembling with fear, to unbar the entrance, and beheld
      a man closely muffled in a cloak. "My good woman," said he,
      "will you grant a poor traveler the shelter of your roof
      to-night'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "Right willingly will I," said she; "for the love of
      <i>one</i>, for whose sake all travelers are welcome here."
      6. "For whose sake is it that you make all wanderers
      welcome?" asked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. "For the sake of our good king, Robert Bruce, who, though
      he is now hunted like a wild beast, with horn and hound, I
      trust yet to see on the throne of Scotland!"
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "Nay, then, my good woman," replied the man, "since you
      love him so well, know that you see him now <i>I</i> am
      Robert Bruce."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "<i>You'!</i>&mdash;are <i>you</i> our king'?" she
      inquired, sinking on her knees, and reverently kissing his
      hand; "where, then, are your followers, and why are you thus
      alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "I have no followers now," replied Bruce, "and am,
      therefore, compelled to travel alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "Nay, my liege," exclaimed the loyal dame, "that you
      shall do no longer; for here are my two sons, whom I give to
      you, and may they long live to serve and defend your
      majesty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The Scottish youths bent their knees, and took the oath
      of fealty; and then, sitting beside the fire, the king
      entered into conversation with his new retainers, while their
      mother was busied in preparing the evening meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Suddenly, they were startled by the tramp of horses'
      hoofs, and the voices of men. "'<i>Tis the English!</i>"
      shouted the matron, "<i>fight to the last, my sons, and
      defend your king!</i>" But, at this moment, the king
      recognized the voices of Lord James, of Douglas, and of
      Edward Bruce, and bade them have no fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Bruce was overjoyed at meeting with his brother, and his
      faithful friend Douglas, who had with them a band of one
      hundred and fifty men. He bade farewell to the brave and
      loyal woman, and, taking with him her two sons, left the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. The two young Scots served Bruce well and faithfully, and
      were high officers in his service when, at the head of a
      conquering army, he drove the English invaders from the soil
      of Scotland, and rendered her again a <i>free and independent
      kingdom</i>.

    <h4>
      ROBERT BRUCE AND THE SPIDER.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      BERNARD BARTON.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. Not in <i>prosperity's broad light</i>,
      Can reason justly scan
    The <i>sterling worth which</i>, viewed aright,
<i>Most dignifies the man</i>.
    Favored at once by wind and tide,
    The skillful pilot well may guide
      The bark in safety on;
    Yet, when his harbor he has gained,
    He who no conflict hath sustained,
      No meed has fairly won.
 2. But in <i>adversity's dark hour</i>
<i>Of peril and of fear,</i>
    When clouds above the vessel lower,
      With scarce one star to cheer;
    When winds are loud, and waves are high,
    And ocean, to a timid eye,
      Appears the seaman's grave;
    Amid the conflict, calm, unmoved,
    By truth's unerring test is proved
<i>The skillful and the brave.</i>
 3. For Scotland and her freedom's right
      The Bruce his part had played;
<i>In five successive fields of fight</i>
<i>Been conquered and dismayed.</i>
<i>Once more, against the English host</i>
<i>His band he led, and once more lost</i>
<i>The meed for which he fought;</i>
    And now, from battle faint and worn,
    The homeless fugitive forlorn
      A hut's lone shelter sought.
 4. And cheerless was that resting-place
      For him who claimed a throne;
    His canopy, devoid of grace,&mdash;
      The rude, rough beams alone;
    The heather couch his only bed,
    Yet well I know had slumber fled
      From couch of eider down;
    Through darksome night to dawn of day,
    Immersed in wakeful thought he lay,
      Of Scotland and her crown.
 5. The sun rose brightly, and its gleam
      Fell on that hapless bed,
    And tinged with light each shapeless beam
      Which roofed the lowly shed;
    When, looking up with wistful eye,
    The Bruce beheld a spider try
      His filmy thread to fling
    From beam to beam of that rude cot;
    And well the insect's toilsome lot
      Taught Scotland's future king.
 6. Six times his gossamery thread
      The wary spider threw:
    In vain the filmy line was sped;
      For, powerless or untrue,
    Each aim appeared and back recoiled
    The patient insect, <i>six times foiled</i>,
      And yet unconquered still;
    And soon the Bruce, with eager eye,
    Saw him prepare once more to try
      His courage, strength, and skill.
 7. <i>One effort more, the seventh and last</i>,&mdash;
      The hero hailed the sign!
    And on the wished-for beam hung fast
      The slender, silken line.
    Slight as it was, his spirit caught
    The more than omen; for his thought
      The lesson well could trace,

    That <i>perseverance gains its meed</i>,
      And <i>patience wins the race</i>.
 8. Is it a tale of mere romance'?
      Its moral is the same,&mdash;
    A light and trivial circumstance'?
      Some thought, it still may claim.
    Art thou a father'? teach thy son
    Never to deem that <i>all is done</i>,
      While <i>aught remains untried</i>;
    To hope, though every hope seems crossed,
    And when his bark is tempest-tossed
      Still calmly to confide.
 9. Hast thou been long and often foiled
 (&lt;)  By adverse wind and seas'?
    And vainly struggled, vainly toiled,
      For what some win with ease'?
    Yet bear up heart, and hope, and will,
    Nobly resolved to struggle still,
      With patience persevere;
    Knowing, when darkest seems the night,
    The dawn of morning's glorious light
      Is swiftly drawing near.
10. Art thou a Christian? shall the frown
      Of fortune cause dismay'?
    The Bruce but won an <i>earthly crown</i>,
      Which long hath passed away;
    For thee a <i>heavenly crown</i> awaits;
    For thee are oped the pearly gates,&mdash;
      Prepared the deathless palm:
    But bear in mind that <i>only those</i>
<i>Who persevere unto the close,</i>
<i>Can join in Victory's psalm</i>.

      That part of this dialogue uttered by Caroline, should be
      read in a very earnest and spirited style,&mdash;that uttered
      by Horace in a more grave, deliberate, and candid manner.
    </p>
    <h4>
      WEALTH AND FASHION.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. What a pity it is that we are born under a
      Republican government!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. Upon my word, Caroline, that is a patriotic
      observation for an American.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Oh, I know that it is not a <i>popular</i>
      one! We must all join in the cry of liberty and equality, and
      bless our stars that we have neither kings nor emperors to
      rule over us, and that our very first audible squeak was
      republicanism. If we don't join in the shout, and hang our
      caps on liberty-poles, we are considered monsters. For my
      part, I am <i>tired</i> of it, and am determined to <i>say
      what I think</i>. I <i>hate</i> republicanism; I hate liberty
      and equality; and I don't hesitate to <i>declare</i> that I
      am for monarchy. You may laugh, but I would say it at the
      stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. Bravo, Caroline! You have almost run yourself
      out of breath. You deserve to be prime minister to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. You mistake; I have no wish to mingle in
      political broils, not even if I could be as renowned as Pitt
      or Fox; but I must say, I think our equality is
      <i>odious</i>. What do you think! To-day, the new
      chamber-maid put her head into the door, and said, "Caroline,
      your marm wants you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. <i>Excellent!</i> I suppose if ours were a
      <i>monarchical</i> government, she would have bent to the
      ground, or saluted your little foot, before she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. No, Horace; you <i>know</i> there are no
      such forms in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. May I ask your highness what you <i>would</i>
      like to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. I should like to be a countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. Oh, you are moderate in your ambition! A
      countess, now-a-days, is the fag-end of nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Oh! but it sounds so
      delightfully,&mdash;<i>"The young Countess Caroline!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. If <i>sound</i> is all, you shall have that
      pleasure; we will call you <i>the young countess</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. That would be mere burlesque, Horace, and
      would make one ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. Nothing can be more inconsistent in us, than
      aiming at titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. For <i>us</i>, I grant you; but, if they
      were <i>hereditary,</i> if we had been born to them, if they
      came to us through belted knights and high-born dames,
      <i>then</i> we might be proud to wear them. I never shall
      cease to regret that I was not born under a monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. You seem to forget that all are not lords and
      ladies in <i>royal</i> dominions. Suppose you should have
      drawn your first breath among the <i>lower
      classes</i>,&mdash;suppose it should have been your lot to
      crouch and bend, or be trodden under foot by some titled
      personage, whom in your heart you despised; what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. You may easily suppose that I did not mean
      to take <i>those</i> chances. No; I meant to be born among
      the <i>higher</i> ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. Your own reason must tell you, that <i>all</i>
      can not be born among the <i>higher ranks</i>; for then the
      <i>lower ones</i> would be wanting, which constitute the
      comparison. Now, Caroline, is it not better to be born under
      a government where there are no such ranks, and where <i>the
      only nobility is talent and virtue'?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Talent and virtue! I think <i>wealth</i>
      constitutes our nobility, and the right of abusing each
      other, our liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. You are as fond of aphorisms as
      Lavater[Headnote 1] was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Let me ask you if our rich men, who ride in
      their own carriages, who have fine houses, and who count by
      millions, are not our <i>great</i> men?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. They have all the greatness that <i>money</i>
      can buy; but this is very limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Well, in <i>my</i> opinion, <i>money is
      power</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Horace</i>. You mistake. Money may be <i>temporary
      power</i>, but <i>talent</i> is <i>power itself</i>; and,
      <i>when united with virtue, is godlike power</i>, before
      which the mere man of millions quails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Caroline</i>. Well, Horace, I really wish you the
      possession of <i>talent</i>, and <i>principle</i>, and
      <i>wealth</i> into the bargain. The latter, you think, will
      follow the two former, simply at your beck;&mdash;you smile;
      but <i>I</i> feel as determined in <i>my</i> way of thinking,
      as <i>you</i> do in <i>yours</i>.

      [Headnote 1: SOC' RA TES, the most celebrated philosopher of
      antiquity, was born at Athens, 470 years before Christ. The
      purity of his doctrines, and his independence of character,
      rendered him popular with the most enlightened Athenians,
      though they created him many enemies. He was <i>falsely
      accused</i>, arraigned, and condemned to drink
      <i>hemlock</i>, the juice of a poisonous plant. When the hour
      to take the poison had come, the executioner handed him the
      cup, with tears in his eyes. Socrates received it with
      composure, drank it with unaltered countenance, and, in a few
      moments, expired.]

      rather than fall into the hands of his enemies, destroyed
      himself by taking poison. It is said that, when a youth, he
      frequently declaimed on the sea-shore, while the waves were
      roaring around him, in order to secure a large compass of
      voice, and to accustom himself to the tumult of a popular
      assembly.]

      chap. 17.]
    </p>
    <h4>
      MY FIRST JACK-KNIFE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. I remember it well! Its horn handle, so smooth and clear,
      glowing with the unmeaning, but magic word, "<i>Bunkum;</i>"
      and the blade significantly inviting you to the test, by the
      two monosyllables, "<i>Try me</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I know not how it is, but I never could take half the
      comfort in any thing which I have since possessed, that I
      took in this <i>jack-knife</i>. I earned it myself; and,
      therefore, I had a feeling of independence; it was bought
      with my <i>own money</i>,&mdash;not teazed out of my uncle,
      or still kinder father,&mdash;<i>money</i> that I had
      silently earned on the afternoons of those days set apart for
      boys to amuse themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Yes! with a spirit of persevering industry and
      self-denial, at which I now wonder, I went, every afternoon,
      during "berry-time," and picked the ripened fruit with
      eagerness; for my heart was in the task. I sold my berries,
      and, carefully reserving the proceeds, shortly accumulated
      enough to purchase the treasure, for which I so eagerly
      longed.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. I went to one of the village-stores, and requested the
      clerk to show me his jack-knives; but he, seeing that I was
      only a boy, and thinking that I merely meant to amuse myself
      in looking at the nicest, and wishing it was mine, told me
      not to plague him, as he was otherwise engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. I turned with indignation; but I felt the inward comfort
      of a man who has <i>confidence</i> in his own resources, and
      knows he has the power in his own hands. I quietly jingled
      the money in my pockets, and went to the opposite store. I
      asked for jack-knives, and was shown a lot fresh from the
      city, which were temptingly laid down before me, and left for
      me to select one, while the trader went to another part of
      his store to wait upon an older customer. I looked over them,
      opened them, breathed upon the blades, and shut them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. One was too hard to open, another had no spring; finally,
      after examining them with all the judgment which, in my
      opinion, the extent of the investment required, I selected
      one with a hole through the handle; and, after a dissertation
      with the owner upon jack-knives in general, and <i>this
      one</i> in particular,&mdash;upon hawk-bill, and
      dagger-blades,&mdash;and handles, iron, bone, and
      buck-horn,&mdash;I succeeded in closing a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. I took the instrument I had purchased, and felt a sudden
      expansion of my boyish frame! It was my world! I deposited it
      in my pocket among other valuables,&mdash;twine, marbles,
      slate-pencils, &amp;c. I went home to my father; I told him
      how long I had toiled for it, and how eagerly I had spent
      time, which others had allotted to play, to possess myself of
      my treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. My father gently chided me for not telling him of my
      wants; but I observed his glistening eye turn affectionately
      to my mother and then to me, and I thought that his manly
      form seemed to straighten up and to look prouder than I had
      ever before seen him. At any rate, he came to me, and,
      patting my curly head, told me there was no object in life,
      which was reasonably to be desired, that <i>honesty,
      self-denial, well-directed industry</i>, and
      <i>perseverance</i> would not place within my reach; and if,
      through life, I carried the spirit of independent exertion
      into practice, which I had displayed in the purchase of the
      jack-knife, I should become a "<i>great man</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. From that moment, I was a new being. I had discovered that
      I could <i>rely upon myself</i>. I took my jack-knife, and
      many a time, while cutting the walnut-saplings for my bow, or
      the straight pine for my arrow, or carving my mimic ship, did
      I muse upon these words of my father,&mdash;so deeply are the
      kind expressions of a judicious parent engraven on the heart
      and memory of boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. My knife was my constant companion. It was my carpenter,
      my ship-builder, and my toy-manufacturer. It was out upon all
      occasions, never amiss, and always "handy;" and, as I valued
      it, I never let it part from me. I own my selfishness; I
      would divide my apples among my playmates, my whole store of
      marbles was at their service,&mdash;they might knock my bats,
      kick my foot-ball as they chose; but I had no partnership of
      enjoyments in my jack-knife. Its possession was connected in
      my mind with something so <i>exclusive</i>, that I could not
      permit another to take it for a moment. Oh! there is a wild
      and delicious luxury in one's boyish anticipations and
      youthful day-dreams!
    </p>
    <p>
      11. If, however, the <i>use</i> of my jack-knife afforded me
      pleasure, the idea of its possession was no less a source of
      enjoyment. I was, for the time being, a little prince among
      my fellows,&mdash;a perfect monarch. Let no one exclaim
      against aristocracy; were we all perfectly <i>equal
      to-day</i>, there would be an <i>aristocracy to-morrow</i>.
      Talent, judgment, skill, tact, industry, perseverance, will
      place some on the top, while the contrary attributes will
      place others at the bottom of fortune's ever-revolving wheel!
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The plowman is an aristocrat, if he excels in his
      vocation: he is an aristocrat, if he turns a better or a
      straighter furrow than his neighbor. The poorest poet is an
      aristocrat, if he writes more feelingly, in a purer language,
      or with more euphonic jingle than his cotemporaries. The
      fisherman is an aristocrat, if he wields his harpoon with
      more skill, and hurls it with a deadlier energy than his
      messmates, or has even learned to fix his bait more
      alluringly on his barbed hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. All <i>have</i> had, and <i>still</i> have their foibles;
      all have some possession, upon which they pride themselves,
      and I was proud of my jack-knife! Spirit of Socrates,
      [Headnote 1] forgive me! was there no pride in dying like a
      philosopher'? Spirit of Demosthenes, [Headnote 2] forgive me!
      was there no pride in your addresses to the boundless and
      roaring ocean'? Spirit of David! [Headnote 3] was there no
      pride in the deadly hurling of the smooth pebble, which sank
      deep into the forehead of your enemy'?
    </p>
    <p>
      14. But I must take my jack-knife and <i>cut short</i> this
      digression. Let no man say <i>this</i> or <i>that</i>
      occurrence "will make <i>no difference fifty years
      hence</i>,"&mdash;a common, but dangerous phrase. I am
      <i>now</i> a man of three-score years. I can point my finger
      <i>here</i> to my ships, <i>there</i> to my warehouse. My
      name is well known in two hemispheres. I have drank deeply of
      intellectual pleasures, have served my country in many
      important stations, have had my gains and my losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. I have seen many, who started with fairer prospects, but
      with no compass, wrecked before me; but I have been impelled
      in my operations, no matter how extensive, by the <i>same
      spirit</i> which conceived and executed the purchase of the
      jack-knife. And I have found my reward in it; and, perhaps,
      in after years, there will be those who will say that the
      predictions of my father were fulfilled in their case; and
      that, from <i>small beginnings</i>, by "<i>honesty,
      self-denial, well-directed industry</i>, and
      <i>perseverance</i>," they also, BECAME TRULY "GREAT MEN."

    <h4>
      THE PINE-TREE SHILLINGS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. Captain John Hull was the mint-master of Massachusetts,
      and coined all the money that was made there. This was a new
      line of business; for, in the earlier days of the colony, the
      current coinage consisted of gold and silver money of
      England, Portugal, and Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. These coins being scarce, the people were often forced to
      barter their commodities, instead of selling them. For
      instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he, perhaps,
      exchanged a bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of
      molasses, he might purchase it with a pile of pine-boards.
      Musket-bullets were used instead of farthings.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Indians had a sort of money, called <i>wampum</i>,
      which was made of clam-shells; and this strange sort of
      specie was, likewise, taken in payment of debts, by the
      English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard of. There
      was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the
      country, to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they
      sometimes had to take quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or
      cords of wood, instead of silver or gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with
      another increased, the want of current money was still more
      sensibly felt. To supply the demand, the general court passed
      a law for establishing a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and
      threepences. Captain John Hull was appointed to manufacture
      this money, and was to have <i>one shilling</i>, out of every
      twenty, to pay him for the trouble of making them.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Hereupon, all the old silver in the colony was handed over
      to Captain John Hull. The battered silver cans, and tankards,
      and silver-buckles, and broken spoons, and silver-buttons of
      worn-out coats, and silver hilts of swords that had figured
      at courts,&mdash;all such curious old articles were,
      doubtless, thrown into the melting-pot together. But by far
      the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the
      mines of South America, which the English buccaneers, (who
      were little better than pirates,) had taken from the
      Spaniards, and brought to Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. All this old and new silver being melted down and coined,
      the result was an immense amount of splendid shillings,
      sixpences, and threepences. Each had the date, 1652, on the
      one side, and the figure of a <i>pine-tree</i> on the other.
      Hence, they were called <i>pine-tree shillings</i>. And, for
      every <i>twenty shillings</i> that he coined, you will
      remember, Captain John Hull was entitled to put <i>one
      shilling</i> into his own pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master
      would have the best of the bargain. They offered him a large
      sum of money, if he would but give up that <i>twentieth
      shilling</i>, which he was continually dropping into his own
      pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied
      with the shilling. And well he might be; for, so diligently
      did he labor, that, in a few years, his pockets, his
      money-bags, and his strong box, were overflowing with
      pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case when he came
      into possession of Grandfather's chair; and, as he had worked
      so hard at the mint, it was certainly proper that he should
      have a comfortable chair to rest himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man,
      Samuel Sewell by name, fell in love with his only daughter.
      His daughter, whom we will call Betsey, was a fine, hearty
      damsel, by no means so slender as some young ladies of our
      own days. As Samuel was a young man of good character,
      industrious in his business, and a member of the church, the
      mint-master very readily gave his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "Yes; you may take her," said he, in his rough way; "and
      you'll find her a heavy burden enough!" On the wedding-day,
      we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself in a
      plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of
      pine-tree shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat were
      sixpences; and the knees of his small-clothes were buttoned
      with silver threepences.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Thus attired, he sat with great dignity in Grandfather's
      chair; and, being a portly old gentleman, he completely
      filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite side of the
      room, between her bridemaids, sat Miss Betsey, blushing like
      a full-blown peony.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple
      coat, and gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as
      the Puritan laws and customs would allow him to put on. His
      hair was cropped close to his head, because Governor Endicott
      had forbidden any man to wear it below the ears. But he was a
      very personable young man; and so thought the bridemaids and
      Miss Betsey herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The mint-master, also, was pleased with his new
      son-in-law; especially as he had courted Miss Betsey out of
      pure love, and had said nothing at all about her portion. So,
      when the marriage ceremony was over, Captain Hull whispered a
      word to two of his men-servants, who immediately went out,
      and soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They
      were such a pair as wholesale merchants use for weighing
      bulky commodities; and quite a bulky commodity was now to be
      weighed in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "Daughter Betsey," said the mint-master, "get into one
      side of these scales." Miss Betsey, or Mrs. Sewell, as we
      must now call her, did as she was bid, like a dutiful child,
      without any question of the why and wherefore. But what her
      father could mean, unless to make her husband pay for her by
      the pound, (in which case she would have been a dear
      bargain,) she had not the least idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. "And now," said honest John Hull to the servants, "bring
      that box hither." The box, to which the mint-master pointed,
      was a huge, square, iron-bound, oaken chest. The servants
      tugged with might and main; but could not lift this enormous
      receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it across the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked
      the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! <i>it was
      full to the brim of bright pine-tree shillings</i>, fresh
      from the mint; and Samuel Sewell began to think that his
      father-in-law had got possession of all the money in the
      Massachusetts' treasury. But it was only the mint-master's
      honest share of the coinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Then the servants, at Captain Hull's command, heaped
      double handfuls of shillings into one side of the scales,
      while Betsey remained in the other. Jingle, jingle, went the
      shillings, as handful after handful was thrown in, till,
      plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young
      lady from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. "There, son Samuel," said the honest mint-master,
      resuming his seat in Grandfather's chair, "take these
      shillings for my daughter's portion. Use her kindly, and
      thank Heaven for her. <i>It is not every wife that's worth
      her weight in silver!</i>"
    </p>

      HIAWATHA'S HUNTING.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      LONGFELLOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lesson is taken from "The Song of Hiawatha," a poem,
      founded upon traditions current among some tribes of North
      American Indians, respecting an imaginary being of more than
      mortal powers and gifts, named Hiawatha. The scene of the
      poem is laid among the Ojibways, or Chippewas, a tribe of
      Indians, occupants, from the period of our earliest history,
      of the basin of Lake Superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.<br>
       Then the little Hiawatha<br>
       Learned of every bird its language,<br>
       Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
       How they built their nests in summer,<br>
       Where they hid themselves in winter,<br>
       Talked with them where'er he met them,<br>
       Called them "Hiawatha's chickens."
    </p>
    <p>
      2.<br>
       Of all beasts he learned the language,<br>
       Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
       How the beavers built their lodges,<br>
       Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br>
       How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br>
       Why the rabbit was so timid,<br>
       Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br>
       Called them "Hiawatha's brothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      3.<br>
       Then Ia'goo, the great boaster,<br>
       He, the marvelous story-teller,<br>
       He, the traveler and the talker,<br>
       Made a bow for Hiawatha;<br>
       From a branch of ash he made it,<br>
       From an oak-bough made the arrows,<br>
       Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,<br>
       And the cord he made of deer-skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.<br>
       Then he said to Hiawatha,<br>
       "Go, my son, into the forest,<br>
       Where the red deer herd together,<br>
       Kill for us a famous roebuck,<br>
       Kill for us a deer with antlers."<br>
       Forth into the forest straightway<br>
       All alone walked Hiawatha<br>
       Proudly with his bow and arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.<br>
       And the birds sang round him, o'er him<br>
       "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha."<br>
       Sang the robin, sang the bluebird,<br>
       "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha."<br>
       Up the oak-tree, close beside him,<br>
       Sprang the squirrel, lightly leaping<br>
       In and out among the branches;<br>
       Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,<br>
       Laughed, and said between his laughing,<br>
       "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha."
    </p>
    <p>
      6.<br>
       And the rabbit from his pathway<br>
       Leaped aside, and, at a distance,<br>
       Sat erect upon his haunches,<br>
       Half in fear, and half in frolic,<br>
       Saying to the little hunter,<br>
       "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha."
    </p>
    <p>
      7.<br>
       But he heeded not nor heard them,<br>
       For his thoughts were with the red deer;<br>
       On their tracks his eyes were fastened,<br>
       Leading downward to the river,<br>
       To the ford across the river,<br>
       And as one in slumber walked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.<br>
       Hidden in the alder bushes,<br>
       There he waited till the deer came,<br>
       Till he saw too antlers lifted,<br>
       Saw two eyes look from the thicket,<br>
       Saw two nostrils point to windward,<br>
       And the deer came down the pathway,<br>
       Flecked with leafy light and shadow.<br>
       And his heart within him fluttered,<br>
       Trembled like the leaves above him,<br>
       Like the birch leaf palpitated,<br>
       As the deer came down the pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.<br>
       Then, upon one knee uprising,<br>
       Hiawatha aimed an arrow;<br>
       Scarce a twig moved with his motion,<br>
       Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,<br>
       But the wary roebuck started,<br>
       Stamped with all his hoofs together,<br>
       Listened with one foot uplifted,<br>
       Leaped as if to meet the arrow;<br>
       Ah, the singing, fatal arrow,<br>
       Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.<br>
       Dead he lay there in the forest,<br>
       By the ford across the river;<br>
       Beat his timid heart no longer;<br>
       But the heart of Hiawatha<br>
       Throbbed, and shouted, and exulted,<br>
       As he bore the red deer homeward.

    <h4>
      A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER WITH A PANTHER.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      BOY'S BOOK OF ADVENTURES.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I had left the hunting party more than an hour, when I
      came upon the track of my old friend Konwell, who was, with
      his dogs, on the bloody trail of a panther. The animal must
      have had one of his legs broken; this was indicated by the
      marks on the soft ground; and it was plain that the tracks
      were made by three feet instead of four, and accompanied by
      blood at every leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I determined to follow; and, after a tramp of nearly an
      hour, I overtook my friend at the entrance of a cavern, where
      he stood waiting for me. The wounded animal had taken refuge
      in this cave, leaving us to do whatever we thought best. The
      poor beast doubtless supposed that within this murky recess
      he was safe from pursuit; but he was mistaken. Konwell
      informed me that he had hidden a bundle of pine splinters in
      a gulley, about half a mile distant, and that if I would keep
      guard over the mouth of the cave, he would go and bring it.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. I agreed to this measure; and, with ready gun and drawn
      knife, prepared for any attack that might be made. I lay down
      at the entrance of the panther's cave. My friend soon
      returned, bringing the pine, as he had promised. His next
      movement was to kindle a large fire at the mouth of the cave,
      at which we lighted our torches; and, having taken the
      flambeaus in our left hand, while we carried our guns in the
      right, we cautiously entered the cave. I crept on before; but
      the space within soon became so high and roomy, that we could
      stand upright, and keep close to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Bending toward the left, the cavity extended a
      considerable distance within the hill. After we had advanced
      about two hundred steps, we saw the glaring eyes of the
      wounded beast, which gleamed forth like two fiery balls,
      reflecting most luridly the light of our torches. Konwell now
      took my flambeau and stepped behind me. I leveled my gun in
      the direction of those flaming eyes, and fired. After the
      report, we heard a bustle; but could not exactly make out
      what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. I reloaded my gun, resumed my torch, and Konwell now took
      his place in front. But, as those flaming eyes were no longer
      to be seen, we felt obliged to go farther. Our guns ready
      loaded, we believed ourselves to be prepared for anything. We
      proceeded carefully, as men are likely to do when suspecting
      danger, when, instantly, the panther started up from a
      hollow, in which he was lying, quite close to our feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It was a fearful sight to look upon him as he stood with
      ears laid back, his white teeth set together, as if in
      intense anger, and those wide open eyes glowing and sparkling
      as they rested upon us, his assailants. I can never forget
      his appearance. In a moment our guns were discharged, and the
      cave returned the thundering echo. We had both fired so
      precisely at the same moment, that neither of us could
      believe the other had discharged his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. We were certain that our enemy had been struck, but we
      knew not whether killed or only disabled. Quick as thought,
      we dropped our guns and drew our knives from the sheath. And
      haste was necessary; for the echo had not relapsed into
      silence, before we felt the weight of the panther against us;
      and we began cutting at him with our knives, and, at the same
      moment, in consequence of our hurried movements, our torches
      died out, and we were left in utter darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Deafened by the noise and utterly bewildered, I turned to
      fly from the now raging enemy, and only became perfectly
      aware of what I was doing, when I found myself standing
      beside Konwell outside the cave in the open air. I only know
      now, that, enveloped in thick darkness, and almost suffocated
      with the smoke of gunpowder, I groped about, not knowing what
      I wished or intended; and that Konwell, at last, drew me
      forcibly to the mouth of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. There we stood, each one brandishing his hunting-knife in
      his right hand, and holding the extinguished torch in the
      left; as we looked on each other, we scarcely knew whether to
      laugh or to be frightened at the strange figures we made. We
      were black with powder-smoke, covered with sweat and blood,
      and our clothing torn to rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Konwell complained of a pain in his breast. I opened the
      bosom of his shirt, and found two deep gashes made by the
      panther's claws, extending from the left shoulder to the pit
      of the stomach. I also received a few scratches, but our
      stout hunting-shirts were torn to shreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Until this moment, neither of us had felt that he was
      wounded; and even now, before we began to think of dressing
      those wounds, we made a large fire at the mouth of the
      cavern, in order to prevent the panther from coming forth.
      This done, we sat down beside the genial blaze to wash and
      bind up our scratches, and consult on what plan it was now
      best to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. That the panther was still in the cave we were certain;
      but, whether living or dead, we did not know; at all events,
      he was wounded; for our hunting-knives were covered with
      blood quite up to the hilt. But we had no choice left; we
      must return; for our guns and Konwell's powder-flask, which
      the animal dragged off with him, still lay within the cavern.
      We therefore plucked up new courage; and, having relighted
      our torches, we brandished our knives, and prepared, though
      not without some heart throbbings, once more to enter the
      panther's den.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. With light and cautious steps, lest we might be as
      unpleasantly surprised as we had been when we made our hasty
      retreat, we advanced, holding our torches before us, to the
      spot where we had dropped our guns, and without meeting with
      any hinderance from our enemy. Once more in possession of our
      trusty weapons, we reloaded them, and stepped forward with
      lighter hearts, yet still with great caution, when Konwell
      exclaimed, as he raised the flaming pine high above his head,
      and pointed with it in a certain direction, "<i>See! there he
      is!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      14. This was the first word that had been spoken since we
      re&euml;ntered the cavern. I looked in the indicated
      direction, and there, indeed, lay the panther, stretched out
      at full length, but no longer dangerous. His eyes were set,
      his limbs were rigid,&mdash;the last agony was over. We
      skinned and cut him up as he lay. All three bullets had
      struck him, and both knives penetrated his body; and it must
      have been in the death-struggle that he leaped upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. When our work was ended, and we again came to the open
      air, the sun was low in the horizon, and all haste was
      necessary that we should set out on our forest-path without
      further delay. Our wounds smarted not a little, and, although
      we took time once more to wash them, they became so stiff
      that our progress was both toilsome and tedious. We soon
      became convinced that we should not succeed in reaching our
      companions while daylight remained, and we determined to
      bivouac for the night, at the foot of a rocky declivity,
      which promised a good shelter from the cutting wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. To add to our discomfort, hunger began to make itself
      painfully felt; but this was soon overpowered by weariness,
      and, having gathered up the dry pine branches, we kindled up
      a good fire, and, without troubling ourselves to prepare any
      thing for supper, we stretched ourselves on the grass before
      it, and found the warmth most grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Worn out by the toils of the day, in a few minutes
      Konwell was fast asleep; but, although much inclined to
      follow his example, I was prevented by the restlessness of my
      dog, which seemed to wish to warn me of the presence of
      danger. The faithful animal, cringing closely to me, laid his
      nose on my shoulder, raising his head from time to time, and
      whined, as though he wished to communicate something, and
      then, for a few moments, would remain quiet. Then, suddenly,
      he would rise up as in the attitude of listening,
      occasionally uttering a low growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Completely awakened by this strange behavior on the part
      of my faithful dog, it seemed to me as if I heard a slight
      rustling among the dry bushes; and, rising up to a
      half-sitting posture, I looked toward the rock behind me,
      and, to my great astonishment, became aware of a pair of
      glaring eyes fastened upon me. As my head was between the
      fire and those fearful eyes, I could plainly distinguish the
      fiery balls as, reflected on by the red light, they peered
      above the naked rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. It was a panther, and evidently, from the position in
      which I saw it, was ready for a spring. Happily on this, as
      on every other night, my trusty gun lay close beside me. I
      seized it, and, half-rising, so that the fire behind me
      afforded light for a steady aim, I leveled it exactly between
      the eyes. I fired, the bullet sped on its deadly errand, and
      the crack of the noble rifle, thundering against the steep
      rocks, returned with loud and prolonged echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Konwell, to whom the report of a gun was ever the
      sweetest music, now started up, as if roused by an electric
      shock, and grasped his gun. The dog continued his barking,
      smelling all around, and looking in my face as if to inquire
      in what direction he should go. There was no rustling
      movement on the rock, and the bullet must have taken effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. Konwell shook his head as he inquired, "Why I had shot?"
      Without answering, I began to reload my gun: this finished, I
      took up a blazing pine brand from the fire, and proceeded to
      climb the steep wall of rock, that raised itself like a
      barrier, about twenty steps distant from the spot upon which
      we rested. Here I found an old panther, the largest I had
      ever seen, lying dead&mdash;my well-directed bullet had
      finished him. I flung the body over the rock, and my old
      comrade dragged him to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. The ball had struck him directly in the right eye,
      passing through the brain. He was a fearful-looking animal,
      with terrible teeth and claws, and the more to be dreaded,
      as, when we cut him up, his stomach was found entirely empty.
      I believed that hunger had driven him so close to the fire;
      but Konwell thought he had scented the fresh venison we had
      with us. Be that as it may, there was little doubt but that
      he would have made a leap, as soon as the intervening fire
      had burned down; to its friendly presence, therefore, on this
      occasion, as a means of Providence, we owed our lives.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What had Konwell driven into a den? 2.
      What preparation did he make, before entering into the
      cavern? 3. How far had the men proceeded before they saw the
      panther? 4. Describe the appearance of the panther, as they
      came near him after the first shot? 5. What did the panther
      do after the men both fired at him? 6. Did they finally
      succeed in killing the panther? 7. Describe the manner in
      which they killed another panther.

      THE POWER OF HABIT.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      JOHN B. GOUGH.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I remember once riding from Buffalo to the Niagara Palls.
      I said to a gentleman, "What river is that, sir?" "That,"
      said he, "is Niagara river."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. "Well, it is a beautiful stream," said I; "bright, and
      fair, and glassy. How far off are the rapids?" "Only a mile
      or two," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. "Is it <i>possible</i> that only a mile from us, we shall
      find the water in the turbulence which it must show near the
      Falls'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find it so, sir." And so I found it; and the first
      sight of Niagara I shall never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Now, launch your bark on that Niagara river; it is bright,
      smooth, beautiful, and glassy. There is a ripple at the bow;
      the silver wake you leave behind, adds to your enjoyment.
      Down the stream you glide, oars, sails, and helm in proper
      trim, and you set out on your pleasure excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Suddenly, some one cries out from the bank, "<i>Young men,
      ahoy!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The rapids are below you!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "Ha! ha! we have heard of the rapids; but we are not such
      fools as to get there. If we go too fast, then we shall up
      with the helm, and steer to the shore; we will set the mast
      in the socket, hoist the sail, and speed to the land. Then
      on, boys; don't be alarmed,&mdash;there is no danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. "Young men, ahoy there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The rapids are below you!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff; all things delight us.
      What care we for the future! No man ever saw it. Sufficient
      for the day is the evil thereof. We will enjoy life while we
      may,&mdash;will catch pleasure as it flies. This is
      enjoyment; time enough to steer out of danger when we are
      sailing swiftly with the current."
    </p>
    <p>
      9 (<i>ff.</i>) "YOUNG MEN, AHOY!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "BEWARE! BEWARE! THE RAPIDS ARE BELOW YOU!"
    </p>
    <p>
      10. "Now you see the water foaming all around. See how fast
      you pass that point! Up with the helm! Now turn! Pull hard!
      (=) Quick! quick! quick! pull for your lives! pull till the
      blood starts from your nostrils, and the veins stand like
      whip-cords upon your brow! Set the mast in the socket! hoist
      the sail! (<i>sl.</i>) Ah! ah! it is too late! Shrieking,
      howling, blaspheming; over they go."
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Thousands go over the rapids of intemperance every year,
      through <i>the power of habit</i>, crying all the while,
      "<i>When I find out that it</i> [Footnote: Temperate
      drinking.] <i>is injuring me, I will give it up!</i>"

    <pre>
1. Go, feel what I have felt,
     Go, bear what I have borne;
   Sink 'neath a blow a father dealt,
     And the cold, proud world's scorn;
   Thus struggle on from year to year,
   Thy sole relief,&mdash;the scalding tear.
2. Go, weep as I have wept,
     O'er a loved father's fall,
   See every cherished promise swept,&mdash;
     Youth's sweetness turned to gall;
   Hope's faded flowers strewed all the way
   That led me up to woman's day.
3. Go, kneel as I have knelt;
     Implore, beseech, and pray,
   Strive the besotted heart to melt,
     The downward course to stay;
   Be cast with bitter curse aside,&mdash;
   Thy prayers burlesqued, thy tears defied.
4. Go, stand where I have stood,
     And see the strong man bow;
   With gnashing teeth, lips bathed in blood,
     And cold and livid brow;
   Go, catch his wandering glance, and see
   There mirrored, his soul's misery.
5. Go, hear what I have heard,&mdash;
     The sobs of sad despair,
   As memory's feeling fount hath stirred,
     And its revealings there
   Have told him what he might have been,
   Had he the drunkard's fate foreseen.
6. Go to my mother's side,
     And her crushed spirit cheer;
   Thine own deep anguish hide,
     Wipe from her cheek the tear;
   Mark her dimmed eye,&mdash;her furrowed brow,
   The gray that streaks her dark hair now;
   Her toil-worn frame, her trembling limb,
   And trace the ruin back to him
   Whose plighted faith, in early youth,
   Promised eternal love and truth;
   But who, forsworn, hath yielded up
   That promise to the deadly cup,
   And led her down from love and light,
   From all that made her pathway bright,
   And chained her there 'mid want and strife,
   That lowly thing,&mdash;<i>a drunkard's wife!</i>
   And stamped on childhood's brow so mild,
   That withering blight, <i>a drunkard's child!</i>
7. Go, hear, and see, and feel, and know,
     All that <i>my soul</i> hath felt and known,
   Then look upon the wine-cup's glow;
     See if its brightness can atone;
   Think if its flavor you will try,
   If all proclaimed, "<i>'Tis drink and die!</i>"

8. Tell me I <i>hate</i> the bowl;
<i>Hate</i> is a feeble word:
(<i>f.</i>) <i>I loathe</i>, ABHOR,&mdash;<i>my very soul</i>
<i>With strong disgust is stirred</i>,
   Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell,
   Of the DARK BEVERAGE OF HELL!!

    <h4>
      THE TWO YOUNG TRAVELERS.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      MERRY'S MUSEUM.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Horace and Herman, two young men who were friends, set out
      to travel in distant countries. Before they departed, each
      had formed a <i>plan</i> of proceeding. Horace determined to
      give himself up entirely to <i>pleasure,</i>&mdash;to go
      wherever his humor might dictate,&mdash;and to keep no
      records of his adventures. In short, he resolved to <i>enjoy
      himself</i> as much as possible, and, by no means, to
      encumber his mind with cares, duties, or troubles of any
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Herman was as fond of amusement as Horace; but the
      <i>mode</i> he adopted for the gratification of his wishes,
      was quite different. In the first place, he made out a scheme
      of his travels: he procured maps, read books, and, after
      mature deliberation, adopted a certain route, as most likely
      to afford him pleasure as well as instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In the formation of this plan, he spent several weeks;
      and, in this occupation, he found quite as much satisfaction
      as he afterwards did in traveling. Thus he obtained one great
      advantage over his idle and luxurious friend, who foolishly
      thought that the essence of enjoyment lay in freedom from
      thought, restraint, and toil. Even before they set out on
      their journey, Herman had actually found nearly as
      <i>much</i> pleasure as Horace received in the whole course
      of his expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The two young men started together; and, as there were
      then no canals or railroads, they both set out on foot. They
      had not proceeded far before they separated,&mdash;Horace
      taking one road and Herman another.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. After the lapse of three years, they both returned; but
      what a difference between them! Horace was morose and
      dissatisfied; he had seen a good deal of the world, but, as
      he had traveled with no other design than to <i>gratify
      himself</i> from hour to hour, he had soon exhausted the cup
      of pleasure, and found nothing at the bottom but the bitter
      dregs of discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. He pursued pleasure, till, at last, he found the pursuit
      to be distasteful and revolting. He grew tired even of
      amusement. He indulged his tastes, humors, and passions,
      until indulgence itself was disgusting. When he returned to
      his friends, he had laid up nothing in his memory, by the
      relation of which he could amuse them; he had kept no record
      of things he had seen; he brought back no store of pleasing
      and useful recollections for himself, or others. Such was the
      result of three years' travel for pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It was quite otherwise with Herman. Adhering to his plans,
      he visited a great many places, and, each day, he recorded in
      his journal what he had seen. Whenever he met with an
      interesting object, he stopped to contemplate it. If it was
      some aged relic, famous in history, he took pains to
      investigate its story, and to write it down. If it was an
      object of interest to the eye, he made a sketch of it in a
      book which he kept for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. In this way, Herman accomplished three good objects. In
      the first place, by taking pleasure in a moderate way, and
      mixing with it a little toil and industry, he prevented that
      cloying surfeit which, at last, sickened and disgusted
      Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. In the second place, he greatly increased his enjoyments
      by the plan he adopted. Merely executing a plan is agreeable,
      and a source of great pleasure. It is natural to derive
      happiness from following out a design,&mdash;from seeing,
      hour by hour, day by day, how results come about, in
      conformity to our intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. But <i>this</i> was not the <i>only</i> advantage which
      Herman received from his system. The very toil he bestowed;
      the investigations he made; the pleasant thoughts and curious
      knowledge that were unfolded to his mind; the excitement he
      found in his exertions; the pleasure he took in drawing
      picturesque scenes; <i>all</i> constituted a rich harvest of
      pleasure, which was wholly denied to Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Thus it was that labor and industry, exerted in carrying
      out a plan, afforded the young traveler a vast deal of
      gratification. The very things that Horace looked upon as
      hateful, were, in fact, the sources of his friend's most
      permanent enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. In the third place, Herman had come back laden with rich
      stores of knowledge, observation, and experience. Not only
      was his journal rich in tales, legends, scenes, incidents,
      and historical records, but in putting these things down on
      paper, his memory had been improved, and he had acquired the
      habit of observing and remembering. His mind was full of
      pleasant things, and nothing could be more interesting than
      to hear him tell of his travels, and of what he had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. While Horace was dull, silent, and sour, Herman was full
      of conversation, life, and interest. The one was happy', the
      other unhappy`; one was agreeable', the other disagreeable`;
      one had exhausted the cup of pleasure', the other seemed
      always to have the cup full and sparkling before him`. It was
      agreed on all hands that Horace was a disagreeable person,
      and everybody shunned him; while Herman was considered by all
      a most agreeable companion, and everybody sought his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. So much for the two travelers; <i>one</i>, a luxurious
      lover of pleasure, who thought only of the passing moment,
      and, in his folly, abused and threw away his powers of
      enjoyment; the <i>other</i>, a lover of pleasure also; but
      who pursued it moderately, with a wise regard to the future,
      and careful attention, every day, to the rules of duty; and
      who thus secured his true happiness.

    <h4>
      HIGHER!
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. HIGHER! It is a word of noble import. It lifts the soul of
      man from low and groveling pursuits, to the achievement of
      great and noble deeds, and ever keeps the object of his
      aspiration in view, till his most sanguine expectations are
      fully realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. HIGHER! lisps the infant that clasps its parent's knee,
      and makes its feeble effort to rise from the floor. It is the
      first inspiration of childhood to burst the narrow confines
      of the cradle, and to exercise those feeble, tottering limbs,
      which are to walk forth in the stateliness of manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. HIGHER! echoes the proud school-boy in his swing; or, as
      he climbs the tallest tree of the forest, that he may look
      down upon his less adventurous comrades with a flush of
      exultation,&mdash;and abroad over the fields, the meadows,
      and his native village.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. HIGHER! earnestly breathes the student of philosophy and
      nature. He has a host of rivals; but he must excel them all.
      The midnight oil burns dim; but he finds light and knowledge
      in the lamps of heaven, and his soul is never weary, when the
      last of them is hid by the splendors of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. And HIGHER! his voice thunders forth, when the dignity of
      manhood has mantled his form, and the multitude is listening
      with delight to his oracles, burning with eloquence, and
      ringing like true steel in the cause of <i>Freedom</i> and
      <i>Right</i>. And when time has changed his locks to
      silver,&mdash;when the young and the old unite to do him
      honor, he still breathes forth from his generous heart fond
      wishes for their welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. HIGHER YET! He has reached the apex of earthly honor; yet
      his spirit burns as warm as in youth, though with a steadier
      and purer light. And even now, while his frail tenement
      begins to admonish him, that "the time of his departure is at
      hand," he looks forward, with rapturous anticipation, to the
      never-fading glory, attainable only in the presence of the
      Most High.

      THE AMBITIOUS APPRENTICE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. "How far is it from here to the sun?" asked Harmon Lee of
      his father's apprentice, James Wallace, intending by the
      question to elicit some reply that would exhibit the boy's
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. James Wallace, a boy of fourteen, turned his bright,
      intelligent eyes upon the son of his employer, and replied,
      "I don't know, Harmon. How far is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      3. There was something so honest and earnest in the tone of
      the boy, that, much as Harmon had felt disposed, at first, to
      sport with his ignorance, he could not refrain from giving
      him a true answer. Still, his contempt for the ignorant
      apprentice was not to be concealed, and he replied,
      "<i>Ninety-five millions of miles</i>, you ignoramus!" James
      did not retort; but, repeating over in his mind the distance
      named, fixed it indelibly upon his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. On the same evening, after he had finished his day's work,
      he obtained a small text-book on astronomy, which belonged to
      Harmon Lee, and went up into his garret with a candle, and
      there, alone, attempted to dive into the mysteries of that
      sublime science. As he read, the earnestness of his attention
      fixed nearly every fact upon his mind. So intent was he, that
      he perceived not the flight of time, until the town-clock
      struck ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. He lay down upon his hard bed, and gave full scope to his
      thoughts. Hour after hour passed away, but he could not
      sleep, so absorbed was he in reviewing the new and wonderful
      things he had read. At last, wearied nature gave way, and he
      fell into a slumber, filled with dreams of planets, moons,
      comets, and fixed stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The next morning the apprentice boy resumed his place at
      the work-bench with a new feeling; and, with <i>this</i>
      feeling, was mingled one of regret, that he could not go to
      school as well as Harmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can study at night, while he is asleep," he said to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Just then Harmon Lee came into the shop, and, approaching
      James, said, for the purpose of teasing him, "How big round
      is the earth, James?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Twenty-five thousand miles,</i>" was the quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Harmon looked surprised, for a moment, and then responded,
      with a sneer,&mdash;for he was not a kind-hearted boy, but,
      on the contrary, very selfish, and disposed to <i>injure</i>
      rather than <i>do good</i> to others,&mdash;"Oh! how
      wonderfully wise you are all at once! And no doubt you can
      tell how many moons Jupiter has? Come, let us hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. "Jupiter has four moons," James answered, with something
      of exultation in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, no doubt, you can tell how many rings it has?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jupiter has no rings. Saturn has rings, and Jupiter belts,"
      James replied, in a decisive tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. For a moment or two Harmon was silent with surprise and
      mortification, to think that his father's <i>apprentice</i>,
      whom he esteemed so far below him, should be possessed of
      knowledge equal to his, and on the points in reference to
      which he had chosen to question him,&mdash;and that he should
      be able to convict him of an error, into which he had
      purposely fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "I should like to know how long it is since you became so
      wonderfully wise," said Harmon, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very long," James replied calmly. "I have been reading
      one of your books on astronomy."
    </p>
    <p>
      12. "I should like to know what business <i>you</i> have to
      touch one of <i>my</i> books! You had better be minding your
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not neglect it, Harmon; I read at <i>night</i>, after
      I was done with my work; and I did not hurt your book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care if you <i>didn't</i> hurt it. You are not going
      to have <i>my</i> books, I can tell you. So, you just let
      them alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Poor James's heart sank within him at this unexpected
      obstacle, so suddenly thrown in his way. He had no money of
      his own to buy, and knew of no one from whom he could borrow
      the book, that had become so necessary to his happiness. "Do,
      Harmon," he said, "lend me the book; I will take good care of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I will not. And don't you dare to touch it," was the
      angry reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. James Wallace knew well enough the selfish disposition of
      Harmon, to be convinced that there was now but little hope of
      his having the use of his books, except by stealth; and from
      that his naturally open and honest principles revolted. All
      day he thought earnestly of the means whereby he should be
      able to obtain a book on astronomy, to quench the ardent
      thirst he had created in his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. He was learning the trade of a blind-maker. Having been
      already an apprentice for two years, and being industrious
      and intelligent, he had acquired a readiness with tools, and
      much skill in some parts of his trade. While sitting alone,
      after he had finished his work for the day, it occurred to
      him that he might, by working in the evening, earn some
      money, and with it buy such books as he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. By consent of his employer, he succeeded in getting a
      small job, from one of his neighbors; and, in a short time,
      by working evenings, he obtained sufficient money to purchase
      a book of his own, and had a half dollar left, with which he
      bought a second-hand dictionary. Every night found him poring
      over his books; and, as soon as it was light enough in the
      morning to see, he was up and reading. During the day, his
      mind was pondering over the things he had read, while his
      hands were diligently employed in the labor assigned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. It occurred, just at this time, that a number of
      benevolent individuals established, in the town where James
      lived, one of those excellent institutions, an Apprentices'
      Library. To this he applied, and obtained the books he
      needed. And thus, did this poor apprentice boy lay the
      foundation of future eminence and usefulness. At the age of
      twenty-one, he was master of his trade; and, what was more,
      had laid up a vast amount of general and scientific
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Let us now turn to mark the progress of the young
      student, Harmon Lee, in one of the best seminaries in his
      native city, and afterwards at college. The idea that he was
      to be a lawyer, soon took possession of his mind, and this
      caused him to feel contempt for other boys, who were merely
      designed for trades or store-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Like too many others, he had no love for learning. To be
      a <i>lawyer</i> he thought would be much more honorable than
      to be a mere mechanic; and, for this reason <i>alone</i>, he
      desired to be one. As for James Wallace, the poor illiterate
      apprentice, he was most heartily despised, and never treated
      by Harmon with the least degree of kind consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. At the age of eighteen, Harmon was sent away to one of
      the eastern universities, and there remained until he was
      twenty years of age, when he graduated, and came home with
      the honorary title of Bachelor of Arts. On the very day that
      James completed his term of apprenticeship, Harmon was
      admitted to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. From some cause, James determined he would make law
      <i>his</i> profession. To the acquirement of a knowledge of
      legal matters, therefore, he bent all the energies of a well
      disciplined mind. Two years passed away in an untiring
      devotion to the studies he had assigned himself, and he then
      made application for admission to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      22. Young Wallace passed his examinations with some applause,
      and the first case on which he was employed, chanced to be
      one of great difficulty, which required all his skill; the
      lawyer on the opposite side was Harmon Lee, who entertained
      for his father's apprentice the utmost contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. The cause came on. There was a profound silence and a
      marked attention and interest, when the young stranger arose
      in the court-room to open the case. A smile of contempt
      curled the lip of Harmon Lee, but Wallace saw it not. The
      prominent points of the case were presented in plain, but
      concise language to the court; and a few remarks bearing upon
      its merits being made, the young lawyer took his seat, and
      gave room for the defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      24. Instantly Harmon Lee was on his feet, and began referring
      to the points presented by his "very learned brother," in a
      very flippant manner. There were those present who marked the
      light that kindled in the eye of Wallace, and the flash that
      passed over his countenance at the first contemptuous word
      and tone that were uttered by his antagonist at the bar.
      These soon gave place to attention, and an air of conscious
      power. Nearly an hour had passed when Harmon resumed his seat
      with a look of exultation, which was followed by a pitying
      and contemptuous smile, as Wallace again slowly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      25. Ten minutes, however, had not passed when that smile had
      changed to a look of surprise, mortification, and alarm. The
      young lawyer's first speech showed him to be a man of calm,
      deep, systematic thought,&mdash;well skilled in points of law
      and in authorities,&mdash;and, more than all, a lawyer of
      practical and comprehensive views. When he sat down, no
      important point in the case had been left untouched, and none
      that had been touched, required further elucidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Lee followed briefly, in a vain attempt to torture his
      language and break down his positions. But he felt that he
      was contending with weapons whose edges were turned at every
      blow. When he took his seat again, Wallace merely remarked
      that he was prepared, without further argument, to submit the
      case to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. The case was accordingly submitted, and a decision
      unhesitatingly made in favor of the plaintiff, or Wallace's
      client. From that hour James Wallace took his true position.
      <i>The despised apprentice became the able and profound
      lawyer,</i> and was esteemed for real talent and real moral
      worth, which, when combined, ever place their possessor in
      his true position. Ten years from that day, Wallace was
      elevated to the bench, while Lee, a second-rate lawyer, never
      rose above that position.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What profession did James study, after he
      had learned his trade? 2. Who was his opponent in the first
      cause he tried? 3. Which won the case? 4. What did James
      finally become?

    </p>
    <p>
      1. "Oh, you're a <i>'prentice!</i>" said a little boy, the
      other day, tauntingly, to his companion. The boy addressed
      turned proudly round, and, while the fire of injured pride,
      and the look of pity were strangely blended in his
      countenance, coolly answered, "<i>So was Franklin!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This dignified reply struck me forcibly, and I turned to
      mark the disputants more closely. The former, I perceived by
      his dress, was of a higher class in society than his humble,
      yet more dignified companion. The latter was a sprightly,
      active lad, scarce twelve years old, and coarsely, but neatly
      attired. But, young as he was, there was visible in his
      countenance much of genius, manly dignity, and determinate
      resolution; while that of the former showed only fostered
      pride, and the imagined superiority of riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That little fellow, thought we, gazing at our young hero,
      displays already much of the man, though his calling be a
      humble one; and, though poverty extends to him her dreary,
      cheerless reality, still he looks on the brightest side of
      the scene, and already rises in anticipation from poverty and
      wretchedness! Once, "<i>so was Franklin</i>" and the world
      may one day witness in our little "<i>'prentice</i>" as great
      a philosopher as they have already seen in his noble pattern!
      And we passed on, buried in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The motto of our infantile philosopher contains
      much,&mdash;too much to be forgotten, and should be engraven
      on the minds of all. What can better cheer man in a humble
      calling, than the reflection that the greatest and the best
      of earth&mdash;the greatest statesmen, the brightest
      philosophers, and the proudest warriors&mdash;have once
      graced the same profession?
    </p>
    <p>
      5.<br>
       "Look at Franklin! He who<br>
       With the thunder talked, as friend to friend,<br>
       And wove his garland of the lightning's wing,<br>
       In sportive twist."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he? A <i>printer!</i> once a subordinate in a
      printing office! Poverty stared him in the face; but her
      blank, hollow look, could nothing daunt him. He struggled
      against a harder current than most are called to encounter;
      but he did not yield. He pressed manfully onward; bravely
      buffeted misfortune's billows, and gained the desired haven!
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Look at Cincinnatus! At the call of his country he laid
      aside the plow and seized the sword. But having wielded it
      with success, when his country was no longer endangered, and
      public affairs needed not his longer stay, "he beat his sword
      Into a ploughshare," and returned with honest delight to his
      little farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Look at Washington! What was his course of life? He was
      first a <i>farmer;</i> next a <i>Commander in Chief</i> of
      the hosts of freedom, fighting for the liberation of his
      country from the thralls of despotic oppression; next, called
      to the highest seat of government by his ransomed brethren, a
      <i>President of the largest Republic on earth</i>, and
      lastly, a <i>farmer</i> again.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. What was the famous Ben Jonson? He was first a
      <i>brick-layer, or mason!</i> What was he in after years?
      'Tis needless to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Burns? An Ayrshire <i>plowman!</i> What was he in
      after life, in the estimation of his countrymen, and the
      world? Your library gives the answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      9. But shall we go on, and call up, in proud array, all the
      mighty host of worthies that have lived and died, who were
      cradled in the lap of penury, and received their first
      lessons in the school of affliction'? Nay'; we have cited
      instances enough already,&mdash;yea, more than enough to
      prove the point in question&mdash;namely, <i>that there is no
      profession, however low in the opinion of the world, but has
      been honored with earth's greatest and worthiest.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Young man! Does the iron hand of misfortune press hard
      upon you, and disappointments well-nigh sink your despairing
      soul'? Have courage! Mighty ones have been your predecessors,
      and have withstood the current of opposition that threatened
      to overwhelm their fragile bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Do you despise your humble station, and repine that
      Providence has not placed you in some nobler sphere'? Murmur
      not against the dispensations of an All-wise Creator!
      Remember that wealth is no criterion of moral rectitude or
      intellectual worth,&mdash;that riches dishonestly gained, are
      a lasting curse,&mdash;that virtue and uprightness work out a
      rich reward,&mdash;and that
    </p>
    <pre>
"An honest man's the noblest work of God."
</pre>
    <p>
      12. And when dark Disappointment comes, do not wither at her
      stare; but press forward, and the prize is yours! It was thus
      with <i>Franklin</i>,&mdash;it can be thus with <i>you</i>.
      He strove for the prize, and he won it! So may <i>you!</i>
      'Tis well worth contending for; and may success attend you,
      and the "stars" grow brighter, as the "stripes" wear deeper!

    <h4>
      AN INGENIOUS STRATAGEM.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      DAYS OF WASHINGTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In the early part of the war, a sergeant and twelve armed
      men undertook a journey through the wilderness, in the State
      of New Hampshire. Their route was remote from any settlement,
      and they were under the necessity of encamping over night in
      the woods. Nothing material happened the first day of their
      excursion; but, early in the afternoon of the second, they,
      from an eminence, discovered a body of armed Indians
      advancing toward them, whose number rather exceeded their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As soon as the whites were perceived by their red
      brethren, the latter made signals, and the two parties
      approached each other in an amicable manner. The Indians
      appeared to be much gratified with meeting the sergeant and
      his men, whom, they observed, they considered as their
      protectors. They said they belonged to a tribe which had
      raised the hatchet with zeal in the cause of liberty, and
      were determined to do all in their power to repel the common
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. They shook hands in friendship. When they had conversed
      with each other for some time, and exchanged mutual good
      wishes, they, at length, separated, and each party traveled
      in a different direction. After proceeding to the distance of
      a mile or more, the sergeant, who was acquainted with all the
      different tribes, and knew on which side of the contest they
      were respectively ranked, halted his men, and addressed them
      in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "My brave companions, we must use the utmost caution, or
      this night may be our last. Should we not make some
      extraordinary exertions to defend ourselves, to-morrow's sun
      may find us sleeping, never to wake. You are surprised,
      comrades, at my words, and your anxiety will not be lessened,
      when I inform you that we have just passed <i>our most
      inveterate foe</i>, who, under the mask of pretended
      friendship, which you have witnessed, would lull us to
      security, and, by such means, in the unguarded moments of our
      midnight slumber, without resistance, seal our fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The men with astonishment listened to this short harangue;
      and their surprise was greater, as not one of them had
      entertained the suspicion but that they had just encountered
      friends. They all immediately resolved to enter into some
      scheme for their mutual preservation, and the destruction of
      their enemies. By the proposal of their leader, the following
      plan was adopted and executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The spot selected for their night's encampment, was near a
      stream of water, which served to cover their rear. They
      felled a large tree, before which, on the approach of night,
      a brilliant fire was lighted. Each individual cut a log of
      wood, about the size of his body, rolled it nicely in his
      blanket, placed his hat upon one end, and laid it before the
      fire, that the enemy might be deceived, and mistake it for a
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. After they had thus fitted out logs, equal in number to
      the sergeant's party, and had so artfully arranged them, that
      they might be easily mistaken for so many soldiers, the men
      with loaded muskets placed themselves behind the fallen tree,
      by which time the shades of evening began to close around.
      The fire was kept burning brilliantly until late in the
      evening, when it was suffered to decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The critical time was now approaching, when an attack
      might be expected from the Indians; but the sergeant's men
      rested in their place of concealment with great anxiety, till
      near midnight, without perceiving any movement of the enemy.
      At length, a tall Indian was discovered, through the
      glimmering of the fire, cautiously moving toward them, making
      no noise, and apparently using every means in his power to
      conceal himself from any one about the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. For a time, his actions showed him to be suspicious that a
      guard might be stationed to watch any unusual appearance, who
      would give the alarm in case of danger; but, all appearing
      quiet, he ventured forward more boldly, rested upon his toes,
      and was distinctly seen to move his finger as he numbered
      each log of wood, or what he supposed to be a human being
      quietly enjoying repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. To satisfy himself more fully, as to the number, he
      counted them over a second time, and cautiously retired. He
      was succeeded by another Indian, who went through the same
      movements, and retired in the same manner. Soon after, the
      whole party, sixteen in number, were discovered approaching,
      and greedily eyeing their supposed victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The feelings of the sergeant's men can be better imagined
      than described, when they saw the base and cruel purpose of
      their enemies, who were now so near that they could scarcely
      be restrained from firing upon them. The plan, however, of
      the sergeant, was to have his men remain silent in their
      places of concealment, till the muskets of the savages were
      discharged, that their own fire might be effectual, and
      opposition less formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Their suspense was not of long duration. The Indians, in
      a body, cautiously approached till within a short distance:
      they then halted, took deliberate aim, discharged their
      pieces upon inanimate logs, gave a dreadful war-whoop, and
      instantly rushed forward, with tomahawk and scalping knife in
      hand, to dispatch the living, and obtain the scalps of the
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. As soon as they had collected in close order, more
      effectually to execute their horrid intentions, the
      sergeant's party discharged their pieces, not on logs of
      wood, but perfidious savages,&mdash;many of whom fell under
      the hot fire of the little band, and the rest precipitately
      fled. But for this ingenious scheme, it is probable that not
      one of these twelve men would have escaped the tomahawk of
      the savages.

      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What did the sergeant say to his men,
      after parting with the Indians? 2. What plan did the sergeant
      propose for their preservation? 3. Did the plan succeed? 4.

    <h4>
      FRANCES SLOCUM, THE YOUNG CAPTIVE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The great massacre at Wyoming was, perhaps, the
      most bloody and terrible chapter of the Revolution. A
      combined Indian and Tory force had flung itself upon the
      peaceful valley, and murdered or made captive nearly all its
      unoffending inhabitants; its old and its young,&mdash;men,
      women, and children alike,&mdash;were either indiscriminately
      butchered or made prisoners. Among the prisoners taken on
      that occasion, was an infant child by the name of Frances
      Slocum. The story is a very strange one; we copy it from
      Lossing's very excellent work, "The Field Book of the
      Revolution."]
    </p>
    <p class="rauth">
      B.J. LOSSING.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. I passed the evening with the venerable Joseph Slocum,
      whose family was among the sufferers, in Wyoming Valley. He
      related to me all the particulars of the capture and final
      discovery of his sister Frances, and other incidents
      connected with the sufferings of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. His father was a Quaker, and was distinguished for his
      kindness to the Indians. He remained unharmed at the time of
      the invasion, and, while the torch was applied to the
      dwellings of others, <i>his</i> was left untouched. But his
      son Giles was in the battle. This, doubtless, excited the ire
      of the Indians, and they resolved on vengeance. 3. Late in
      the autumn, they were seen prowling about the house, which
      was situated about one hundred rods from the Wilkesbarre
      Fort. A neighbor, named Kingsley, had been made prisoner, and
      his wife and two sons had a welcome home in Mr. Slocum's
      family. One morning, the boys were grinding a knife near the
      house, when a rifle-shot and a shriek brought Mrs. Slocum to
      the door. An Indian was scalping the eldest boy, a lad of
      fifteen, with the knife he had been grinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The savage then went into the house, and caught up a
      little son of Mrs. Slocum. "See!" exclaimed the frightened
      mother, "he can do thee no good; he is lame." The Indian
      released the boy, took up her little daughter Frances, aged
      five years, gently in his arms, and, seizing the younger
      Kingsley, hastened to the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Two Indians who were with him, carried off a black girl,
      about seventeen years of age. Mr. Slocum's daughter caught up
      her brother Joseph, (my informant,) two and a half years old,
      and fled in safety to the fort, where an alarm was given; but
      the savages were beyond successful pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. About six weeks afterward, Mr. Slocum and his
      father-in-law Ira Tripp, were shot and scalped by some
      Indians while foddering cattle near the house. Again the
      savages escaped with their horrid trophies. Mrs. Slocum,
      bereft of father, husband, and child, and stripped of all
      possessions but the house that sheltered her, could not leave
      the valley, for nine helpless children were yet in her
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. She trusted in the God of Elijah; and, if she was not fed
      by the ravens, she was spared by the vultures. She mourned
      not for the dead; for they were at rest: but little Frances,
      her lost darling, where was she? The lamp of hope kept on
      burning; but years rolled by, and no tidings of the little
      one came.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When peace returned, and friendly intercourse with Canada
      was established, two of the little captive's brothers started
      in search of her. They traversed the wilderness to Niagara,
      offering rewards for her recovery; but all in vain. They
      returned to Wyoming, convinced that the child was dead. But
      the mother's heart was still the shrine of hope, and she felt
      assured that Frances was not in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Her soul appeared to commune with that of her child, and
      she often said, "I know Frances is still living." At length,
      the mother's heart was cheered: a woman (for many years had
      now passed, and Frances, if living, must have arrived to
      womanhood) was found among the Indians, answering the
      description of the lost one. She only remembered being
      carried away from the Susquehanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Mrs. Slocum took her home, and cherished her with a
      mother's tenderness. Yet the mysterious link of sympathy
      which binds the maternal spirit to its offspring, was unfelt,
      and the bereaved mother was bereaved still. "It may be
      Frances, but it does not seem so; yet the woman shall ever be
      welcome," said Mrs. Slocum. The foundling, also, felt no
      filial yearnings; and, both becoming convinced that no
      consanguinity existed, the orphan returned to her Indian
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. From time to time, the hope of the mother would be
      revived, and journeys were made to distant Indian settlements
      in search of the lost sister; but in vain. The mother went
      "down into the grave, mourning," and little Frances was
      almost forgotten. Her brothers had become aged men, and their
      grandchildren were playing upon the very spot, whence she had
      been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. In the summer of 1837, fifty-nine years after her
      capture, intelligence of Frances was received. Colonel Ewing,
      an Indian agent and trader, in a letter from Logansport,
      Indiana, to the editor of the <i>Lancaster Intelligencer</i>,
      gave such information, that all doubts respecting her
      identity were removed; and Joseph Slocum, with the sister who
      carried him to the fort, and yet survived, immediately
      journeyed to Ohio, where they were joined by their younger
      brother Isaac.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. They proceeded to Logansport, where they found Mr. Ewing,
      and ascertained that the woman spoken of by him, lived about
      twelve miles from the village. She was immediately sent for;
      and, toward evening the next day, she came into the town,
      riding a spirited young horse, accompanied by her two
      daughters, and the husband of one of them,&mdash;all dressed
      in full Indian costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. An interpreter was procured, (for she could not speak or
      understand English,) and she listened seriously to what her
      brothers had to say. She answered but little, and, at sunset,
      departed for her home, promising to return the next morning.
      The brother and sister were quite sure that it was indeed
      Frances, though in her face nothing but Indian lineaments
      were seen, her color alone revealing her origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. True to her appointment, she appeared the following
      morning, accompanied as before. Mr. Joseph Slocum then
      mentioned a mark of recognition, which, his mother had said,
      was a sure test. While playing, one day, with a hammer in a
      blacksmith's shop, Joseph, then a child two and a half years
      old, gave Frances a blow upon the middle finger of the left
      hand, which crushed the bone, and deprived the finger of its
      nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. This test Mr. Slocum had withheld until others should
      fail. When he mentioned it, the aged woman was greatly
      agitated; and, while tears filled the furrows of her face,
      she held out the wounded finger. There was no longer a doubt,
      and a scene of great interest ensued. Her affections for her
      kindred, that had slumbered half a century, were aroused, and
      she made earnest inquiries after her father, mother,
      brothers, and sisters. Her full heart&mdash;full with the
      cherished secrets of her history&mdash;was opened, and the
      story of her life freely given.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. She said the savages, who were Delawares, after taking
      her to a rocky cave in the mountains, departed to the Indian
      country. The first night was the unhappiest of her life. She
      was kindly treated,&mdash;being carried tenderly in their
      arms when she was weary. She was adopted in an Indian family,
      and brought up as their daughter. For years she lived a
      roving life, and loved it. She was taught the use of the bow
      and arrow, and became expert in all the employments of savage
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. When she was grown to womanhood, both her Indian parents
      died, and she soon afterward married a young chief of the
      nation, and removed to the Ohio country. She was treated with
      more respect than the Indian women generally; and so happy
      was she in her domestic relations, that the chance of being
      discovered, and compelled to return among the whites, was the
      greatest evil that she feared; for she had been taught that
      they were the implacable enemies of the Indians, whom she
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Her husband died; and, her people having joined the
      Miamies, she went with them, and married one of that tribe.
      The last husband was also dead, and she had been a widow many
      years. Children and grandchildren were around her, and her
      life was passing pleasantly away. When she concluded the
      narrative, she lifted her right hand in a solemn manner, and
      said, "All this is as true as that there is a Great Spirit in
      the heavens!" she had entirely forgotten her native language,
      and was a pagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. On the day after the second interview, the brothers and
      sisters, with the interpreter, rode out to her dwelling. It
      was a well-built log-house, in the midst of cultivation. A
      large herd of cattle and sixty horses were grazing in the
      pasture. Everything betokened plenty and comfort; for she was
      wealthy, when her wants and her means were compared. Her
      annuity from government, which she received as one of the
      Miami tribe, had been saved, and she had about one thousand
      dollars in specie.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. Her white friends passed several days very agreeably with
      her; and subsequently her brother Joseph, with his daughter,
      the wife of the Hon. Mr. Bennet, of Wyoming, made her another
      visit, and bade her a last farewell. She died a few years
      ago, and was buried with considerable pomp; for she was
      regarded as a queen among her tribe.

1. <i>The silver rain, the golden rain,</i>
<i>The tripping, dancing, laughing rain!</i>
   Stringing its pearls on the green leaf's edge,
   Fringing with gems the brown rock's ledge,
   Spinning a vail for the water-fall,
   And building an amber-colored wall
   Across the West where the sun-beams fall:
<i>The gentle rain</i>, in the shady lane,
<i>The pattering, peering, winning rain!</i>
2. <i>The noisy rain, the marching rain,</i>
<i>The rushing tread of the heavy rain!</i>
   Pouring its rivers from out the blue,
   Down on the grass where the daisies grew,
   Darting in clouds of angry drops
   Across the hills and the green tree-tops,
   And kissing, at last, in its giant glee,
   The foaming lips of the great green sea:
<i>The fierce, wild rain, the riotous rain,</i>
<i>The boisterous, dashing, shouting rain!</i>
3. <i>The still night rain, the solemn rain!</i>
<i>The soldier-step of the midnight rain!</i>
   With its measured beat on the roof o'erhead,
   With its tidings sweet of the faithful dead,
   Whispers from loves who are laid asleep
   Under the sod where the myrtles creep,
   Culling bouquets from the sun-lit past,
   Of flowers too sweet, too fair to last:
<i>The faithful rain, the untiring rain,</i>
<i>The cooing, sobbing, weeping rain!</i>
4. <i>The sulky rain, the spiteful rain,</i>
<i>The bothering, pilfering, thieving rain!</i>
   Creeping so lazily over the sky,
   A leaden mask o'er a bright blue eye,
   And shutting in, with its damp, strong hands,
   The rosy faces in curls, and bands
   Of girls who think, with unwonted frown
   Of the charming laces and things down-town,
   That might as well for this tiresome rain,

1. Who dares to scorn the meanest thing,
     The humblest weed that grows,
   While pleasure spreads its joyous wing
     On every breeze that blows?
   The simplest flower that, hidden, blooms
     The lowest on the ground,
   Is lavish of its rare perfumes,
     And scatters sweetness round.
2. The poorest friend upholds a part
     Of life's harmonious plan;
   The weakest hand may have the art
     To serve the strongest man.
   The bird that highest, clearest sings,
     To greet the morning's birth,
   Falls down to drink, with folded wings,
     Love's rapture on the earth.
3. From germs too small for mortal sight
     Grow all things that are seen,
   Their floating particles of light
     Weave Nature's robe of green.
   The motes that fill the sunny rays
     Build ocean, earth, and sky,&mdash;
   The wondrous orbs that round us blaze

4. Life, love, devotion, closely twine,
     Like tree, and flower, and fruit;

     Though fed by leaf and root.
   And he who would be truly great,
     Must venture to be small;
   On airy columns rests the dome
     That, shining, circles all.
5. Small duties grow to mighty deeds;
     Small words to thoughts of power;
   Great forests spring from tiny seeds,
     As moments make the hour.
   And life, howe'er it lowly grows,
     The essence to it given,
   Like odor from the breathing rose,
     Floats evermore to Heaven.

      MURDERER'S CREEK.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [Footnote: In Orange County, New York.]
    </p>
    <p class="rauth">
      JAMES K. PAULDING.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Little more than a century ago, the beautiful region
      watered by this stream, was possessed by a small tribe of
      Indians, which has long since become extinct, or incorporated
      with some other savage nation of the West. Three or four
      hundred yards from where the stream discharges itself into
      the Hudson, a white family, of the name of Stacy, had
      established itself in a log-house, by tacit permission of the
      tribe, to whom Stacy had made himself useful by his skill in
      a variety of little arts, highly estimated by the savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In particular, a friendship subsisted between him and an
      old Indian, called Na&ouml;man, who often came to his house,
      and partook of his hospitality. <i>The Indians never forgive
      injuries, nor forget benefits</i>. The family consisted of
      Stacy, his wife, and two children, a boy and a girl, the
      former five, the latter three years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. One day, Na&ouml;man came to Stacy's log-hut, in his
      absence, lighted his pipe, and sat down. He looked very
      serious, sometimes sighed deeply, but said not a word.
      Stacy's wife asked him what was the matter,&mdash;if he was
      sick. He shook his head, sighed, but said nothing, and soon
      went away. The next day, he came again and behaved in the
      same manner. Stacy's wife began to think strange of this, and
      related it to her husband, who advised her to urge the old
      man to an explanation the next time he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Accordingly, when he repeated his visit the day after, she
      was more importunate than usual. At last, the old Indian
      said. "I am a red man, and the pale faces are our enemies:
      why should I speak?"&mdash;"But my husband and I are your
      friends: you have eaten salt with us a thousand times, and my
      children have sat on your knees as often. If you have
      anything on your mind, tell it me."&mdash;"It will cost me my
      life if it is known, and the white-faced women are not good
      at keeping secrets," replied Na&ouml;man.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "Try me, and see."&mdash;"Will you swear by your Great
      Spirit that you will tell none but your husband?"&mdash;"I
      have none else to tell."&mdash;"But will you swear?"&mdash;"I
      do swear by our Great Spirit, I will tell none but my
      husband."&mdash;"Not if my tribe should <i>kill you</i> for
      not telling?"&mdash;"Not if your tribe should kill me for not
      telling."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Na&ouml;man then proceeded to tell her that, owing to some
      encroachments of the white people below the mountains, his
      tribe had become irritated, and were resolved that night to
      massacre all the white settlers within their reach; that she
      must send for her husband, inform him of the danger, and, as
      secretly and speedily as possible, take their canoe and
      paddle, with all haste, over the river to Fishkill for
      safety. "Be quick, and do nothing that may excite suspicion,"
      said Na&ouml;man, as he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The good wife sought her husband, who was down on the
      river fishing, told him the story, and, as no time was to be
      lost, they proceeded to their boat, which was unluckily
      filled with water. It took some time to clear it out, and,
      meanwhile, Stacy recollected his gun, which had been left
      behind. He proceeded to the house, and returned with it. All
      this took up considerable time, and precious time it proved
      to this poor family.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The daily visits of old Na&ouml;man, and his more than
      ordinary gravity, had excited suspicion in some of the tribe,
      who had, accordingly, paid particular attention to the
      movements of Stacy. One of the young Indians, who had been
      kept on the watch, seeing the whole family about to take to
      the boat, ran to the little Indian village, about a mile off,
      and gave the alarm. Five Indians collected, ran down to the
      river, where their canoes were moored, jumped in, and paddled
      after Stacy, who, by this time, had got some distance out
      into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. They gained on him so fast, that twice he dropped his
      paddle, and took up his gun. But his wife prevented his
      shooting by telling him that, if he fired, and they were
      afterwards overtaken, they would meet with no mercy from the
      Indians. He accordingly refrained, and plied his paddle till
      the sweat rolled in big drops down his forehead. All would
      not do; they were overtaken within a hundred yards from the
      shore, and carried back with shouts of yelling triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. When they got ashore, the Indians set fire to Stacy's
      house, and dragged himself, his wife, and children, to their
      village. Here the principal old men, and Na&ouml;man among
      them, assembled to deliberate on the affair. The chief men of
      the council stated that some of the tribe had, undoubtedly,
      been guilty of treason, in apprising Stacy, the white man, of
      the designs of the tribe, whereby they took the alarm, and
      well-nigh escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. He proposed to examine the prisoners, to learn who gave
      the information. The old men assented to this, and
      Na&ouml;man among the rest. Stacy was first interrogated by
      one of the old men, who spoke English and interpreted to the
      others. Stacy refused to betray his informant. His wife was
      then questioned; while, at the same moment, two Indians stood
      threatening the two children, with tomahawks, in case she did
      not confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. She attempted to evade the truth, by declaring she had a
      dream the night before, which alarmed her, and that she had
      persuaded her husband to fly. "The Great Spirit never deigns
      to talk in dreams to a white face," said the old Indian.
      "Woman, thou hast two tongues, and two faces. Speak the
      truth, or thy children shall surely die." The little boy and
      girl were then brought close to her, and the two savages
      stood over them, ready to execute their bloody orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. "Wilt thou name," said the old Indian, "the red man who
      betrayed his tribe? I will ask thee three times." The mother
      answered not. "Wilt thou name the traitor? This is the second
      time." The poor mother looked at her husband, and then at her
      children, and stole a glance at Na&ouml;man, who sat smoking
      his pipe with invincible gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. She wrung her hands, and wept; but remained silent. "Wilt
      thou name the traitor? 'Tis the third and last time." The
      agony of the mother waxed more bitter; again she sought the
      eye of Na&ouml;man; but it was cold and motionless. A pause
      of a moment awaited her reply, and the tomahawks were raised
      over the heads of the children, who besought their mother not
      to let them be murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. "Stop!" cried Na&ouml;man. All eyes were turned upon him.
      "Stop!" repeated he, in a tone of authority. "White woman,
      thou hast kept thy word with me to the last moment. <i>I am
      the traitor</i>. I have eaten of the salt, warmed myself at
      the fire, shared the kindness, of these Christian white
      people, and it was <i>I</i> that told them of their danger. I
      am a withered, leafless, branchless trunk. Cut me down, if
      you will: I am ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      16. A yell of indignation sounded on all sides. Na&ouml;man
      descended from the little bank where he sat, shrouded his
      face with his mantle of skins, and submitted to his fate. He
      fell dead at the feet of the white woman by a blow of the
      tomahawk.

      17. But the sacrifice of Na&ouml;man, and the firmness of the
      Christian white woman, did not suffice to save the lives of
      the other victims. They perished,&mdash;how, it is needless
      to say; and the memory of their fate has been preserved in
      the name of the pleasant stream, on whose banks they lived
      and died, which, to this day, is called MURDERER'S CREEK.

    <h4>
      NAPOLEON'S ARMY CROSSING THE ALPS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. When Napoleon was carrying war into Italy, he ordered one
      of his officers, Marshal Macdonald, to cross the Splugen with
      fifteen thousand soldiers, and join him on the plains below.
      The Splugen is one of the four great roads which cross the
      Alps from Switzerland to Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When Macdonald received the order, it was about the last
      of November, and the winter storms were raging among the
      mountain passes. It was a perilous undertaking, yet he must
      obey; and the men began their terrible march through narrow
      defiles and overhanging precipices, six thousand feet up, up
      among the gloomy solitudes of the Alps.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The cannon were placed on sleds drawn by oxen, and the
      ammunition was packed on mules. First came the guides,
      sticking their long poles in the snow, in order to find the
      path; then came workmen to clear away the drifts; then the
      dragoons, mounted on their most powerful horses, to beat down
      the track; after which followed the main body of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. They encountered severe storms and piercing cold. When
      half-way up the summit, a rumbling noise was heard among the
      cliffs. The guides looked at each other in alarm; for they
      knew well what it meant. It grew louder and louder. "<i>An
      avalanche! an avalanche!</i>" they shrieked, and the next
      moment a field of ice and snow came leaping down the
      mountain, striking the line of march, and sweeping thirty
      dragoons in a wild plunge below. The black forms of the
      horses and their riders were seen for an instant struggling
      for life, and then they disappeared forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The sight struck the soldiers with horror; they crouched
      and shivered in the blast. Their enemy was not now flesh and
      blood, but wild winter storms; swords and bayonets could not
      defend them from the desolating avalanche. Flight or retreat
      was hopeless; for all around lay the drifted snow, like a
      vast winding-sheet. On they must go, or death was certain,
      and the brave men struggled forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "Soldiers!" exclaimed their commander, "you are called to
      Italy; your general needs you. Advance and conquer, first the
      mountain and the snow, then the plains and the enemy!"
      Blinded by the winds, benumbed with the cold, and far beyond
      the reach of aid, Macdonald and his men pressed on. Sometimes
      a whole company of soldiers were suddenly swept away by an
      avalanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. On one occasion, a poor drummer, crawling out from the
      mass of snow, which had torn him from his comrades, began to
      beat his drum for relief. The muffled sound came up from his
      gloomy resting-place, and was heard by his brother soldiers;
      but none could go to his rescue. For an hour, he beat
      rapidly, then the strokes grew fainter, until they were heard
      no more, and the poor drummer laid himself down to die. Two
      weeks were occupied in this perilous march, and two hundred
      men perished in the undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. This passage of the Splugen is one of the bravest exploits
      in the history of Napoleon's generals, and illustrates the
      truth of the proverb, "<i>Where there is a will there is a
      way</i>." No one can read the heroic deeds of brave men
      grappling with danger and death, without a feeling of respect
      and admiration; but heroic deeds are always the fruit of
      <i>toil</i> and <i>self-sacrifice</i>. <i>No one can
      accomplish great things, unless he aims at great things, and
      pursues that aim with unflinching courage and
      perseverance.</i>

1. We have faith in old proverbs full surely,
     For wisdom has traced what they tell,
   And truth may be drawn up as purely
     From them, as it may from a "well."
   Let us question the thinkers and doers,
     And hear what they honestly say,
   And you'll find they believe, like bold wooers,
     In "<i>Where there's a WILL there's a WAY.</i>"
2. The hills have been high for man's mounting,
     The woods have been dense for his ax,
   The stars have been thick for his counting,
     The sands have been wide for his tracks.
   The sea has been deep for his diving,
     The poles have been broad for his sway,
   But bravely he's proved by his striving,
     That "<i>Where there's a WILL there's a WAY.</i>"
3. Have ye vices that ask a destroyer,
     Or passions that need your control?
   Let Reason become your employer,
     And your body be ruled by your soul.
   Fight on, though ye bleed at the trial,
     Resist with all strength that ye may,
   Ye may conquer Sin's host by denial,
     For, "<i>Where there's a WILL there's a WAY.</i>"
4. Have ye poverty's pinching to cope with'?
     Does suffering weigh down your might'?
   Only call up a spirit to hope with,
     And dawn may come out of the night.
   Oh! much may be done by defying
     The ghost of Despair and Dismay,
   And much may be gained by relying
     On "<i>Where there's a WILL there's a WAY.</i>"
5. Should ye see afar off that worth winning,
     Set out on a journey with trust,
   And ne'er heed though your path at beginning
     Should be among brambles and dust.
   Though it is by footsteps ye do it,
     And hardships may hinder and stay,
   Keep a heart and be sure ye go through it,
     For, "<i>Where there's a WILL there's a WAY.</i>"

      THE CAPTURE OF MAJOR ANDRE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. One of the saddest events in the history of the American
      Revolution is the <i>treason of Arnold</i>, and, in
      consequence of it, <i>the death of Major Andre</i>. Arnold
      was an officer in the American army, who, though brave, had a
      proud and impatient spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. He fancied he had not all the honor and the pay due for
      his services, and, having plunged himself into debt by his
      expensive style of living, these things soured his heart;
      and, as is the case with ungenerous minds, he never
      acknowledged a fault, or forgave an injury. More than this,
      he sought revenge against his countrymen by plotting
      <i>treason against his country</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Soon after forming this bad design, he opened a secret
      correspondence with the English General, Henry Clinton, and,
      at the same time, asked General Washington to give him the
      command of West Point, an important post on the Hudson river.
      Washington let him have it, and this he determined to betray
      into the hands of the enemy, provided he could make out of it
      a good bargain for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. He wrote to General Clinton what he would do, and asked to
      have a secret interview with some English officer, in order
      to agree upon the terms. General Clinton was delighted; for
      he thought an army divided against itself, must prove an easy
      conquest; and he asked Major Andre, a gallant young officer,
      to meet Arnold, and settle the price of his treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Andre did not wish to engage in such business; but he
      obeyed, and went up the Hudson in an English sloop-of-war for
      this purpose. Arnold agreed to meet him at a certain spot,
      and when night came on, sent a little boat to bring him
      ashore. He landed at the foot of a mountain called the Long
      Clove, on the western side of the river, a few miles from
      Haverstraw, where he found the traitor hid in a clump of
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Little did poor Andre foresee the fatal consequences of
      this step. All that still star-light night they sat and
      talked; daylight came, and the business was not concluded.
      Arnold dismissed the boatmen, and led his companion to a
      solitary farm-house on the river's bank, where the papers
      were finally drawn up, and hid in one of Andre's stockings.
      Andre felt how exposed he was to danger in the enemy's
      country, and heartily wished himself back to the sloop.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Forced now, however, to go by land, Arnold gave him a pass
      to go through the American lines; and, at sunset, he set off,
      on horseback, with a guide. They crossed the river, and,
      getting along on their dangerous journey with but few alarms,
      the guide left the next morning, and Andre rode briskly on,
      congratulating himself upon leaving all dangers behind, for
      he was rapidly nearing the English lines, when there was a
      loud shout, "<i>Stand!</i> HALT!" and three men [Footnote:
      Paulding, Williams, and Van Wart.] issued from the woods, one
      seizing the bridle, and the others presenting their guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Andre told them he had a pass to White Plains, on urgent
      business from General Arnold, and begged them not to detain
      him; but the men, suspecting that all was not right, began to
      search him; and, hauling off his boots, they discovered his
      papers in his stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Finding himself detected, he offered them any sum of
      money, if they would let him go. "No;" answered the sturdy
      men, "not if you would give us ten thousand guineas;" for,
      though poor, they were above selling their country at any
      price. Andre was sent a prisoner to General Washington's
      camp. Arnold, on learning the news of his capture,
      immediately fled from West Point, and made his escape to the
      English sloop.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. According to the rules of war, poor Andre was sentenced
      to the death of a spy. Great efforts were made to save him.
      General Clinton offered a large sum to redeem him. So young,
      so amiable, so gallant, and to meet a felon's doom! but, in
      ten days he was hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Arnold lived; but, with the thirty thousand
      dollars&mdash;the price of his treachery&mdash;he lived a
      miserable man, despised even by those who bought him. And one
      impressive lesson which the story teaches, is, that <i>the
      consequences of guilt do not fall alone on the guilty
      man;</i> others are often involved in distress, disgrace, and
      ruin.

      [Headnote 1: TAL' LEY RAND, a distinguished French statesman,
      was born Feb. 13th, 1754. He died May 20th, 1838.]
    </p>
    <h4>
      BENEDICT ARNOLD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. There was a day when Talleyrand[Headnote 1] arrived in
      Havre, direct from Paris. It was the darkest hour of the
      French Revolution. Pursued by the blood-hounds of the Reign
      of Terror, stripped of every wreck of property or power,
      Talleyrand secured a passage to America, in a ship about to
      sail. He was a beggar and a wanderer in a strange land, to
      earn his bread by daily labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. "Is there an American staying at your house?" he asked the
      landlord of the hotel. "I am bound to cross the water, and
      should like a letter to a person of influence in the New
      World." The landlord hesitated a moment, then replied: "There
      is a gentleman up-stairs, either from America or Britain; but
      whether an American or an Englishman, I can not tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He pointed the way, and Talleyrand, who, in his life, was
      Bishop, Prince, and Prime Minister, ascended the stairs. A
      miserable suppliant, he stood before the stranger's door,
      knocked, and entered. In the far corner of the dimly-lighted
      room, sat a man of some fifty years, his arms folded, and his
      head bowed on his breast. From a window directly opposite, a
      faint light rested on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. His eyes looked from beneath the downcast brows, and gazed
      on Talleyrand's face with a peculiar and searching
      expression. His face was striking in outline,&mdash;the mouth
      and chin indicative of an iron will. His form, vigorous, even
      with the snows of fifty winters, was clad in a dark, but rich
      and distinguished costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Talleyrand advanced, stated that he was a fugitive; and,
      under the impression that the gentleman before him was an
      American, he solicited his kind and generous offices. He
      related his history in eloquent French and broken English.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "I am a wanderer, and an exile. I am forced to flee to the
      New World, without a friend or home. You are an American!
      Give me, then, I beseech you, a letter of yours, so that I
      may be able to earn my bread. I am willing to toil in any
      manner; the scenes of Paris have seized me with such horror,
      that a life of labor would be a paradise to a career of
      luxury in France. You will give me a letter to one of your
      friends? A gentleman like yourself has, doubtless, many
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The strange gentleman rose. With a look that Talleyrand
      never forgot, he retreated to the door of the next
      chamber,&mdash;his eyes looking still from beneath his
      darkened brow. He spoke as he retreated backward,&mdash;his
      voice was full of meaning. "I am the only man born in the New
      World, who can raise his hand to God and say, I have not a
      friend, not one, in all America!" Talleyrand never forgot the
      overwhelming sadness of that look which accompanied these
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. "Who are you?" he cried, as the strange man retreated to
      the next room: "your name?" "My name," he replied, with a
      smile that had more of mockery than joy in its convulsive
      expression,&mdash;"my name is Benedict Arnold!" He was gone:
      Talleyrand sank into his chair, gasping the words, "ARNOLD,
      THE TRAITOR!"
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Thus, you see, he wandered over the earth another Cain,
      with the wanderer's mark upon his brow. Even in that secluded
      room, in that inn at Havre, his crimes found him out, and
      forced him to tell his name: that name the synonym of infamy.
      The last twenty years of his life are covered with a cloud,
      from whose darkness but a few gleams of light flash out upon
      the page of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The manner of his death is not exactly known; but we can
      not doubt that he died utterly friendless,&mdash;that remorse
      pursued him to the grave, whispering "John Andre" in his
      ear,&mdash;and that the memory of his course of infamy gnawed
      like a canker at his heart, murmuring forever, "True to your
      country, what might you have been, O ARNOLD, THE TRAITOR!"
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Who was Talleyrand? 2. Why was he obliged
      to flee from Paris? 3. Whom did he seek at Havre? 4. Why did
      he wish to see the stranger? 5. Describe the appearance of
      this stranger. 6. What did he say to Talleyrand? 7. Who did

      BEHIND TIME.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      FREEMAN HUNT.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning
      speed. A curve was just ahead, beyond which was a station, at
      which the cars usually passed each other. The conductor was
      late,&mdash;so late that the period during which the down
      train was to wait, had nearly elapsed: but he hoped yet to
      pass the curve safely. Suddenly, a locomotive dashed into
      sight right ahead. In an instant, there was a collision. A
      shriek, a shock, and fifty souls were in eternity; and all
      because an engineer had been <i>behind time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A great battle was going on. Column after column had been
      precipitated for eight mortal hours on the enemy posted along
      the ridge of a hill. The summer sun was sinking to the west;
      re-enforcements for the obstinate defenders were already in
      sight; it was necessary to carry the position with one final
      charge, or every thing would be lost. A powerful corps had
      been summoned from across the country, and, if it came up in
      season, all would yet be right. The great conqueror,
      confident in its arrival, formed his reserve into an
      attacking column, and led them down the hill. The whole world
      knows the result. Grouchy [Footnote: Pronounced <i>Groo'
      shee</i>.] failed to appear; the imperial guard was beaten
      back; Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner at St.
      Helena, because one of his marshals was <i>behind time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A leading firm, in commercial circles had long struggled
      against bankruptcy. As it had enormous assets in California,
      it expected remittances by a certain day; and if the sums
      promised arrived, its credit, its honor, and its future
      prosperity would be preserved. But week after week elapsed
      without bringing the gold. At last, came the fatal day on
      which the firm had bills maturing to enormous amounts. The
      steamer was telegraphed at daybreak; but it was found on
      inquiry that she brought no funds; and the house failed. The
      next arrival brought nearly half a million to the insolvents,
      but it was too late; they were ruined, because their agent,
      in remitting, had been <i>behind time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A condemned man was led out for execution, he had taken
      human life, but under circumstances of the greatest
      provocation, and public sympathy was active in his behalf.
      Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve, a favorable
      answer had been expected the night before, and, though it had
      not come, even the sheriff felt confident that it would yet
      arrive in season. Thus the morning passed without the
      appearance of the messenger. The last moment was up. The
      prisoner took his place on the drop, the cap was drawn over
      his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a lifeless body hung
      suspended in the air. Just at that moment a horseman came
      into sight, galloping down the hill, his steed covered with
      foam. He carried a packet in his right hand, which he waved
      to the crowd. He was the express rider with the reprieve. But
      he had come too late. A comparatively innocent man had died
      an ignominious death, because a watch had been five minutes
      too slow, making its bearer arrive <i>behind time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the
      most important affairs, the fortunes of individuals, the
      wealth of nations, honor, happiness, life itself, are daily
      sacrificed because somebody is "behind time." There are men
      who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply because
      they are "behind time." Five minutes in a crisis are worth
      years. It is but a little period, yet it has often saved a
      fortune, or redeemed a people. If there is one virtue that
      should be cultivated more than another by him who would
      succeed in life, it is <i>punctuality</i>; if there is one
      error that should be avoided, it is being <i>behind time</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What sad results are mentioned, in
      consequence of being <i>behind time?</i> 2. What virtue
      should be cultivated, and what error avoided? 3. What is the
      use of the hyphen in the word <i>re-enforcements?</i> See

      "HOW HAPPY I'LL BE."
    </h4>
    <pre>
1. A little girl sat amid the flowers,
   In the blush and bloom of childhood's hours;
   She twined the buds in a garland fair,
   And bound them up in her shining hair:
   "Ah, me!" said she, "<i>how happy I'll be</i>,
   When ten years more have gone over me,
   And I am a maiden with youth's bright glow
   Flushing my cheek, and lighting my brow!"
2. A maiden mused in a pleasant room,
   Where the air was filled with a soft perfume;
   Vases were near of antique mold,
   And beautiful pictures, rare and old;
   And she, amid all the beauty there,
   Was by far the loveliest and most fair.
   "Ah, me!" said she, "<i>how happy I'll be</i>,
   When my heart's own choice comes back to me,
   When I proudly stand by my dear one's side,
   With the thrilling joy of a youthful bride!"
3. A mother bent o'er the cradle nest
   Where she soothed her babe to his smiling rest;
   She watched the sleep of her cherub-boy,
   And her spirit throbbed with exulting joy.
   "Ah, me!" said she, "<i>how happy I'll be</i>,
   When he reaches manhood, proud and free,
   And the world bows down, in its rapture wild,
   It the earnest words of my darling child!"
4. An aged one sat by the cozy hearth,
   Counting life's sands as they ebbed from earth;
   Feeble and frail; the race she run
   Had borne her along to the setting sun.
   "Ah, me!" said she, "<i>how happy I'll be</i>,
   When from time's long fever my soul is free,
   When the world fades out with its weary strife,
   And I soar away to a better life!"
5. 'Tis thus we journey from youth to age,
   Longing to turn to another page,
   Striving to hasten the years away,
   Lighting our hearts with the future's ray,
   Hoping on earth till its visions fade,
   Wishing and waiting, through sun and shade,
   But turning, when earth's last tie is riven,
   To the beautiful rest of a fadeless Heaven.

    <pre>
1. He lay upon his dying bed,
(<i>pl.</i>) His eye was growing dim,
   When, with a feeble voice, he called
     His weeping son to him:
   "Weep not, my boy," the veteran said,
     "I bow to Heaven's high will;
   But quickly from yon antlers bring,
     The sword of Bunker Hill."
2. The sword was brought; the soldier's eye
     Lit with a sudden flame;
   And, as he grasped the ancient blade,
     He murmured Warren's[1] name;
   Then said, "My boy, I leave you gold,
     But what is richer still,
   I leave you, mark me, mark me, now,
     The sword of Bunker Hill.
3. "'Twas on that dread, immortal day,
     I dared the Briton's band,
   A captain raised his blade on me,
     I tore it from his hand;
   And while the glorious battle raged,
     It lightened Freedom's will;
   For, boy, the God of Freedom blessed
     The sword of Bunker Hill.
4. "Oh! keep this sword," his accents broke,&mdash;
     A smile&mdash;and he was dead;
   But his wrinkled hand still grasped the blade,
     Upon that dying bed.
   The son remains, the sword remains,
     Its glory growing still,
   And twenty millions bless the sire
     And sword of Bunker Hill.

      THE BIBLE LEGEND OF THE WIS SA HI' KON.
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align:right;">
      LIPPARD.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It was here in the wilds of the Wis sa hi' kon, on the day
      of battle, as the noonday sun came shining through the
      thickly clustered leaves, that two men met in mortal combat.
      They grappled in deadly conflict near a rock that rose, like
      the huge wreck of some primeval world, at least one hundred
      feet above the dark waters of the Wis sa hi'kon.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That man with the dark brow and the darker gray
      eye,&mdash;with the muscular form, clad in the blue
      hunting-frock of the Revolution,&mdash;is a Continental,
      named Warner. His brother was murdered at the massacre of
      Pao'li. That <i>other</i> man, with long black hair drooping
      along his cadaverous face, is clad in the half-military
      costume of a Tory refugee. <i>That</i> is the murderer of
      Pao'li, named Dabney.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. They had met there in the woods by accident; and now they
      fought, not with sword or rifle, but with long and deadly
      hunting-knives, that flash in the light as they go turning,
      and twining, and twisting over the green-sward. At last, the
      Tory is down!&mdash;down on the green-sward, with the knee of
      the Continental upon his breast,&mdash;that up-raised knife
      quivering in the light,&mdash;that dark-gray eye flashing
      death into his face!
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "Quarter! I yield!" gasped the Tory, as the knee was
      pressed upon his breast. "Spare me!&mdash;I yield!"
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "<i>My</i> brother," said the patriot soldier, in a low
      tone of deadly hate,&mdash;"<i>My</i> brother cried for
      quarter on the night of Pa o' li, and, even as he clung to
      your knees, you struck that knife into his heart. Oh, I will
      give you the quarter of Pa o' li!" And his hand was raised
      for the blow, and his teeth were clinched in deadly hate. He
      paused for a moment, and then pinioned the Tory's arms, and,
      with one rapid stride, dragged him to the verge of the rock,
      and held him quivering over the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "Mercy!" gasped the Tory, turning black and ashy by turns,
      as that awful gulf yawned below. "<i>Mercy! I have a wife! a
      child! spare me!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Then the Continental, with his muscular strength gathered
      for the effort, shook the murderer once more over the abyss,
      and then hissed this bitter sneer between his
      teeth,&mdash;"<i>My brother had a wife and two children</i>.
      The morning after the night of Pa o' li, that wife was a
      widow,&mdash;those children were orphans! Would not you like
      to go and beg your life of that widow and her children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The proposal, made by the Continental in the mere mockery
      of hate, was taken in serious earnest by the horror-stricken
      Tory. He begged to be taken to the widow and her children, to
      have the pitiful privilege of begging his life. After a
      moment's serious thought, the patriot soldier consented. He
      bound the Tory's arms yet tighter, placed him on the rock
      again, and then led him up the woods. A quiet cottage,
      imbosomed among the trees, broke on their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. They entered that cottage. There, beside the desolate
      hearth-stone, sat the widow and her children. She was a
      matronly woman of about thirty years, with a face faded by
      care, a deep, dark eye, and long, disheveled hair about her
      shoulder. On one side was a dark-haired boy, of some six
      years; on the other, a little girl, one year younger, with
      light hair and blue eyes. The Bible, an old, venerable
      volume, lay open on that mother's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. And then that pale-faced Tory flung himself on his knees,
      confessed that he had butchered her husband on the night of
      Pa o'li, but begged his life at her hands! <i>"Spare me, for
      the sake of my wife&mdash;my child!"</i> He had expected that
      his pitiful moan would touch the widow's heart; but not one
      relenting gleam softened her pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. "The Lord shall judge between us!" she said in a cold,
      icy tone, that froze the murderer's heart. "Look! The Bible
      lies open before me. I will close that volume, and then this
      boy shall open it, and place his finger at random upon a
      line, and by <i>that line</i> you shall live or die!" This
      was a strange proposal, made in full faith of a wild and dark
      superstition of the olden time. For a moment, the Tory,
      kneeling there, livid as ashes, was wrapt in thought. Then,
      in a faltering voice, he signified his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Raising her dark eyes to heaven, the mother prayed the
      Great Father to direct the finger of her son. She closed the
      book, and handed it to that boy, whose young cheek reddened
      with loathing as he gazed upon his father's murderer. He took
      the Bible, opened its holy pages at random, and placed his
      fingers upon a verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Then there was a silence. That Continental soldier, who
      had sworn to avenge his brother's death, stood there with
      dilating eyes and parted lips. Then the culprit, kneeling on
      the floor, with a face like discolored clay, felt his heart
      leap to his throat. Then, in a clear, bold voice, the widow
      read this line from the Old Testament. It was short, yet
      terrible: "<i>That man shall die!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Look! The brother springs forward to plunge a knife into
      the murderer's heart; but the Tory, pinioned as he is, begs
      that one more trial may be made by the little
      girl,&mdash;that child of five years, with golden hair and
      laughing eyes. The widow consents. There is an awful pause.
      With a smile in her eye, without knowing what she does, the
      little girl opens the Bible,&mdash;she turns her laughing
      face away,&mdash;she places her fingers upon the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. That awful silence grows deeper. The deep-drawn breath of
      the brother, and the broken gasps of the murderer, alone
      disturb the stillness. The widow and dark-eyed boy are
      breathless. That little girl, unconscious as she was, caught
      a feeling of awe from the countenances around her, and stood
      breathless, her face turned aside, and her tiny fingers
      resting on that line of life or death. At last, gathering
      courage, the widow bent her eyes on the page, and read. It
      was a line from the New Testament: "LOVE YOUR ENEMIES." Ah!
      that moment was sublime!
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Oh, awful Book of God! in whose dread pages we see Job
      talking face to face with Jehovah, or Jesus waiting by
      Samaria's well, or wandering by the waves of dark Galilee!
      Oh, awful Book! shining to-night, as I speak, the light of
      that widow's home,&mdash;the glory of the mechanic's
      shop,&mdash;shining where the world comes not, to look on the
      last night of the convict in his cell, lightening the way to
      God, even over that dread gibbet!
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Oh, Book of terrible majesty and child-like
      love,&mdash;for sublimity that crushes the soul into
      awe,&mdash;of beauty that melts the heart with rapture! you
      never shone more strangely beautiful than there in the lonely
      cot of the Wissa hi'kon, where you saved the murderer's life.
      For,&mdash;need I tell you?&mdash;<i>that murderer's life was
      saved</i>. That widow recognized the finger of God, and even
      the stern brother was awed into silence. The murderer went
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Now look ye, how wonderful are the ways of Heaven! That
      very night, as the widow sat by her lonely hearth, her
      orphans by her side,&mdash;sat there with a crushed heart and
      hot eye-balls, thinking of her husband, who, she supposed,
      now lay moldering on the blood-drenched soil of Pa o'
      li,&mdash;there was a tap at the door. She opened it, and
      that husband, living, though covered with wounds, was in her
      arms! He had fallen at Pa o' li, but not in death. <i>He was
      alive</i>,&mdash;his wife lay panting on his breast. That
      night there was a prayer in that wood-embowered cot of the
      Wis sa hi' kon.

    <h4>
      ADVICE TO THE YOUNG.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      E.H. CHAPIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Young friends', in whatever pursuits you may engage, you
      must not forget that the lawful objects of human efforts, are
      but means to higher results and nobler ends. Start not
      forward in life with the idea of becoming mere seekers of
      pleasure,&mdash;sportive butterflies searching for gaudy
      flowers. Consider and act with reference to the true ends of
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This world is but the vestibule of an immortal life. Every
      action of your life touches on some chord that will vibrate
      in eternity. These thoughts and motives within you, stir the
      pulses of a deathless spirit. Act not, then, as mere
      creatures of this life, who, for a little while, are to walk
      the valleys and the hills, to enjoy the sunshine and to
      breathe the air, and then pass away and be no more; but
      <i>act</i> as immortals, with an <i>aim</i> and a
      <i>purpose</i> worthy of your high nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Set before you, as the chief object to be obtained, an
      <i>end</i> that is superior to any on earth,&mdash;<i>a
      desirable end</i>, A PERFECT END. Labor to accomplish a work
      which shall survive unchanged and beautiful, when time shall
      have withered the garland of youth, when thrones of power and
      monuments of art shall have crumbled into ashes; and,
      finally, aim to achieve something, which, when these our
      mutable and perishing voices are hushed forever, shall live
      amid the songs and triumphs of IMMORTALITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Well will it be for you, if you have a <i>guide</i>
      within, which will aid you in every issue which will arm you
      in every temptation, and comfort you in every sorrow.
      Consult, then, that Volume whose precepts will never fail
      you. Consult it with a deep aspiration after the true and
      good, and it shall illuminate your understanding with divine
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Open your soul, and it shall breathe into it a holy
      influence, and fill all its wants. Bind it close to your
      heart; it will be a shield against all the assaults of evil.
      Read it in the lonely hour of desertion; it will be the best
      of companions. Open it when the voyage of life is troubled';
      it is a sure chart. Study it in poverty'; it will unhoard to
      you inexhaustible riches. Commune with it in sickness'; it
      contains the medicine of the soul. Clasp it when dying'; IT
      IS THE CHARTER OF IMMORTALITY.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What ought we not to forget? 2. How ought
      the world to be regarded? 3. How ought we to act and labor?

    <h4>
      THE INTREPID YOUTH.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. It was a calm, sunny day in the year 1750; the scene, a
      piece of forest land in the north of Virginia, near a noble
      stream of water. Implements of surveying were lying about,
      and several men reclining under the trees, betokened, by
      their dress and appearance, that they composed a party
      engaged in laying out the wild lands of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. These persons had apparently just finished their dinner.
      Apart from the group, walked a young man of a tall and
      compact frame, and moved with the elastic tread of one
      accustomed to constant exercise in the open air. His
      countenance wore a look of decision and manliness not usually
      found in one so young, for he was apparently little over
      eighteen years of age. His hat had been cast off, as if for
      comfort, and he had paused, with one foot advanced, in a
      graceful and natural attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Suddenly there was a shriek, then another, and several in
      rapid succession. The voice was that of a woman, and seemed
      to proceed from the other side of a dense thicket. At the
      first scream, the youth turned his head in the direction of
      the sound; but when it was repeated, he pushed aside the
      undergrowth which separated him from it, and, quickening his
      footsteps, as the cries succeeded each other in alarming
      rapidity, he soon dashed into an open space on the banks of
      the stream, where stood a rude log-cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. As the young man broke from the undergrowth, he saw his
      companions crowded together on the banks of the river, while
      in the midst stood the woman, from whom proceeded the
      shrieks, held back by two of the men, but struggling
      vigorously for freedom. It was but the work of a moment for
      the young man to make his way through the crowd and confront
      the female. The instant her eye fell on him, she exclaimed,
      "Oh! sir, you will do something for me. Make them release
      me,&mdash;for the love of God! <i>My boy,&mdash;my poor boy
      is drowning, and they will not let me go!"</i> "It would be
      madness; she will jump into the river," said one, "and the
      rapids would dash her to pieces in a moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The youth had scarcely waited for these words, for he
      recollected the child, a bold little boy of four years old,
      whose beautiful blue eyes and flaxen ringlets made him a
      favorite with all who knew him. He had been accustomed to
      play in the little inclosure before the cabin, but the gate
      having been left open, he had stolen incautiously out,
      reached the edge of the bank, and was in the act of looking
      over, when his mother saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The shriek she uttered only hastened the catastrophe she
      feared; for the child, frightened at the cry of its mother,
      lost its balance, and fell into the stream, which here went
      foaming and roaring along amid innumerable rocks,
      constituting the most dangerous rapids known in that section
      of the country. Scream now followed scream in rapid
      succession, as the agonized mother rushed to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The party we left reclining in the shade within a few
      steps of the accident, were immediately on the spot.
      Fortunate it was that they were so near, else the mother
      would have jumped in after her child, and both been lost.
      Several of the men approached the brink, and were on the
      point of springing in after the child, when the sight of the
      sharp rocks crowding the channel, the rush and whirl of the
      waters, and the want of any knowledge where to look for the
      boy, deterred them, and they gave up the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Not so with the noble youth. His first work was to throw
      off his coat; next to spring to the edge of the bank. Here he
      stood for a moment, running his eyes rapidly over the scene
      below, taking with a glance the different currents and the
      most dangerous of the rocks, in order to shape his course
      when in the stream. He had scarcely formed his conclusion,
      when he saw in the water a white object, which he knew to be
      the boy's dress, and he plunged into the wild and roaring
      rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. <i>"Thank God, he will save my child,"</i> cried the
      mother; <i>"there he is!&mdash;oh! my boy, my darling boy,
      how could I leave you!"</i> Every one had rushed to the brink
      of the precipice, and was now following with eager eyes the
      progress of the youth, as the current bore him onward, like a
      feather in the embrace of the hurricane. Now it seemed as if
      he would be dashed against a jutting rock, over which the
      water flew in foam, and a whirlpool would drag him in, from
      whose grasp escape would appear impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. At times, the current bore him under, and he would be
      lost to sight; then, just as the spectators gave him up, he
      would appear, though far from where he vanished, still
      buffeting amid the vortex. Oh, how that mother's straining
      eyes followed him in his perilous career! how her heart sunk
      when he went under,&mdash;and with what a gush of joy when
      she saw him emerge again from the waters, and, flinging the
      waves aside with his athletic arms, struggle on in pursuit of
      her boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      11. But it seemed as if his generous efforts were not to
      avail; for, though the current was bearing off the boy before
      his eyes, scarcely ten feet distant, he could not, despite
      his gigantic efforts, overtake the drowning child. On flew
      the youth and child; and it was miraculous how each escaped
      being dashed in pieces against the rocks. Twice the boy went
      out of sight, and a suppressed shriek escaped the mother's
      lips; but twice he reappeared, and then, with hands wrung
      wildly together, and breathless anxiety, she followed his
      progress, as his unresisting form was hurried with the onward
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The youth now appeared to redouble his exertions, for
      they were approaching the most dangerous part of the river,
      where the rapids, contracting between the narrow shores, shot
      almost perpendicularly down a declivity of fifteen feet. The
      rush of the waters at this spot was tremendous, and no one
      ventured to approach its vicinity, even in a canoe, lest he
      should be dashed in pieces. What, then, would be the youth's
      fate, unless he soon overtook the child? He seemed fully
      sensible of the increasing peril, and now urged his way
      through the foaming current with a desperate strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Three times he was on the point of grasping the child,
      when the waters whirled the prize from him. The third effort
      was made just as they were entering within the influence of
      the current above the fall; and when it failed, the mother's
      heart sunk within her, and she groaned, fully expecting the
      youth to give up his task. But no; he only pressed forward
      the more eagerly; and, as they breathlessly watched amid the
      boiling waters, they saw the form of the brave youth
      following close after that of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. And now, like an arrow from the bow, pursuer and pursued
      shot to the brink of the precipice. An instant they hung
      there, distinctly visible amid the foaming waters. Every
      brain grew dizzy at the sight. But a shout of involuntary
      exultation burst from the spectators, when they saw the boy
      held aloft by the right arm of the youth,&mdash;a shout that
      was suddenly checked with horror, when they both vanished
      into the abyss below!
    </p>
    <p>
      15. A moment elapsed before a word was spoken, or a breath
      drawn. The mother ran forward, and then stood gazing with
      fixed eyes at the foot of the cataract, as if her all
      depended upon what the next moment should reveal. Suddenly
      she gave the glad cry, (<i>f</i>.) "<i>There they are! See!
      they are safe!</i>&mdash;Great God, I thank thee!" And, sure
      enough, there was the youth still unharmed, and still
      buffeting the waters. He had just emerged from the boiling
      vortex below the cataract. With one hand he held aloft the
      child, and with the other he was making for the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. They ran, they shouted, they scarcely knew what they did,
      until they reached his side, just as he was struggling to the
      bank. They drew him out almost exhausted. The boy was
      senseless; but his mother declared that he still lived, as
      she pressed him frantically to her bosom. The youth could
      scarcely stand, so faint was he from his exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Who can describe the scene that followed,&mdash;the
      mother's calmness while she strove to resuscitate her boy,
      and her wild gratitude to his preserver, when the child was
      out of danger, and sweetly sleeping in her arms? Our pen
      shrinks at the task. But her words, pronounced then, were
      remembered afterwards by more than one who heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. "<i>God will reward you</i>," said she, "as <i>I</i> can
      not. He will do great things for you in return for this day's
      work, and the blessings of thousands besides mine will attend
      you." And so it was; for, to the <i>hero</i> of that hour,
      were subsequently confided the destinies of a mighty nation.
      But, throughout his long career, what tended to make him more
      honored and respected beyond all men, was the
      <i>self-sacrificing spirit</i>, which, in the rescue of that
      mother's child, as in the more august events of his life,
      characterized OUR BELOVED WASHINGTON.

      THE FOUR MISFORTUNES.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      JOHN G. SANE.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. A pious Rabbi, forced by heathen hate,
      To quit the boundaries of his native land,
    Wandered abroad, submissive to his fate,
      Through pathless woods and wastes of burning sand.
 2. A patient ass, to bear him in his flight,
      A dog, to guard him from the robber's stealth,
    A lamp, by which to read the law at night,&mdash;
      Was all the pilgrim's store of worldly wealth.
 3. At set of sun he reached a little town,
      And asked for shelter and a crumb of food;
    But every face repelled him with a frown,
      And so he sought a lodging in the wood.
 4. "'Tis very hard," the weary traveler said,
      "And most inhospitable, I protest,
    To send me fasting to this forest bed;
      But God is good, and means it for the best!"
 5. He lit his lamp to read the sacred law,
      Before he spread his mantle for the night;
    But the wind rising with a sudden flaw,
      He read no more,&mdash;the gust put out the light.
 6. "'Tis strange," he said, "'tis very strange, indeed,
      That ere I lay me down to take my rest,
    A chapter of the law I may not read,&mdash;
      But God is good, and all is for the best!"
 7. With these consoling words the Rabbi tries
      To sleep,&mdash;his head reposing on a log,&mdash;
    But, ere he fairly shut his drowsy eyes,
      A wolf came up and killed his faithful dog.
 8. "What new calamity is this?" he cried;
      "My honest dog&mdash;a friend who stood the test
    When others failed&mdash;lies murdered at my side!
      Well,&mdash;God is good, and means it for the best."
 9. Scarce had the Rabbi spoken, when, alas!&mdash;
      As if, at once, to crown his wretched lot,
    A hungry lion pounced upon the ass,
      And killed the faithful donkey on the spot.
10. "Alas!&mdash;alas!" the weeping Rabbi said,
      "Misfortune haunts me like a hateful guest;
    My dog is gone, and now my ass is dead,&mdash;
      Well, God is good, and all is for the best!"
11. At dawn of day, imploring heavenly grace,
      Once more he sought the town, but all in vain;
    A band of robbers had despoiled the place,
      And all the churlish citizens were slain.
12. "Now God be praised!" the grateful Rabbi cried,
      "If I had tarried in the town to rest,
    I too, with these poor villagers had died,&mdash;
      Sure, God is good, and all is for the best!"
13. "Had not the saucy wind put out my lamp,
      By which the sacred law I would have read,
    The light had shown the robbers to my camp,
      And here the villains would have left me dead.
14. "Had not my faithful animals been slain,
      Their noise, no doubt, had drawn the robbers near,
    And so their master, it is very plain,
      Instead of them, had fallen murdered here.
15. "Full well I see that this hath happened so
      To put my faith and patience to the test;
    Thanks to His name! for now I surely know
      That God is good, and all is for the best!"

    <h4>
      MRS. CREDULOUS AND THE FORTUNE-TELLER.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Credulous.</i> Are you the fortune-teller, sir, that
      knows every thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fortune-Teller.</i> I sometimes consult futurity, madam;
      but I make no pretensions to any supernatural knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Ay, so <i>you</i> say; but every body else
      says you know <i>every thing</i>; and I have come all the way
      from Boston to consult you; for you must know I have met with
      a dreadful loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> We are liable to losses in this world, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Yes; and I have had my share of them, though I
      shall be only fifty, come Thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> You must have learned to bear misfortunes with
      fortitude, by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I don't know how that is, though my dear
      husband, rest his soul, used to say, "Molly, you are as
      patient as Job,[Headnote 1] though you never had any children
      to lose, as he had."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Job was a model of patience, madam, and few
      could lose their all with so much resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Ah, sir', that is too true'; for even the
      small loss <i>I</i> have suffered, overwhelms me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> The loss of property, madam, comes home to the
      bosom of the best of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Yes, sir; and when the thing lost can not be
      replaced, it is doubly distressing. When my poor, good man,
      on our wedding day, gave me the ring, "Keep it, Molly," said
      he, "till you die, for my sake." And now, that I should have
      lost it, after keeping it thirty years, and locking it up so
      carefully all the time, as I did&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> We can not be too careful in this world, madam;
      our best friends often deceive us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> True, sir, true,&mdash;but who would have
      thought that the child I took, as it were, out of the street,
      and brought up as my own, could have been guilty of such
      ingratitude? She never would have touched what was not her
      own, if her vagabond lover had not put her up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Ah, madam, ingratitude is the basest of all
      crimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Yes; but to think that the impudent creature
      should deny she took it, when I saw it in the possession of
      that wretch myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Impudence, madam, usually accompanies crime. But
      my time is precious, and the star that rules your destiny
      will set, and your fate be involved in darkness, unless I
      proceed to business immediately. The star informs me, madam,
      that you are a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> La! sir, were you acquainted with my deceased
      husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> No, madam; we do not receive our knowledge by
      such means. Thy name is Mary, and thy dwelling-place is
      Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Some spirit must have told you this, for
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> This is not all, madam. You were married at the
      age of twenty years, and were the sole heir of your deceased
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I perceive, sir, you know <i>every</i> thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Madam, I can not help knowing what I <i>do</i>
      know; I must therefore inform you that your adopted daughter,
      in the dead of night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> No, sir; it was in the day-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Do not interrupt me, madam. In the dead of
      night, your adopted daughter planned the robbery which
      deprived you of your wedding-ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> No earthly being could have told you this, for
      I never let my right hand know that I possessed it, lest some
      evil should happen to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Hear me, madam; you have come all this distance
      to consult the fates, and find your ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> You have guessed my intention exactly, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Guessed'! madam'. I <i>know</i> this is your
      object; and I know, moreover, that your ungrateful daughter
      has incurred your displeasure, by receiving the addresses of
      a worthless man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Every word is gospel truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> This man has persuaded your daughter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I knew he did, I told her so. But good sir,
      can you tell me who has the ring?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> This young man has it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> But he denies it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> No matter, madam, he has it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> But how shall I obtain it again?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> The law points out the way, madam,&mdash;it is
      <i>my</i> business to point out the rogue,&mdash;you must
      catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> You are right, sir,&mdash;and if there is law
      to be had, I will spend every cent I own, but I will have it.
      I knew he was the robber, and I thank you for the
      information. [<i>Going</i>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> But thanks, madam, will not pay for all my
      nightly vigils, consultations, and calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Oh, right, sir! I forgot to pay you. What am I
      indebted to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> Only five dollars, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> [<i>Handing him the money</i>.] There it is,
      sir. I would have paid twenty rather than not have found the
      ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>F. T.</i> I never take but five, madam. Farewell, madam,
      your friend is at the door with your chaise.

      <i>Friend</i>. Well, Mary, what does the fortune-teller say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Oh, he told me I was a widow, and lived in
      Boston, and had an adopted daughter,&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friend.</i> But you knew all this before, did you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Yes; but how should <i>he</i> know it? He told
      me, too, that I had lost a ring,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friend.</i> Did he tell you where to find it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Oh yes! he says that fellow has it, and I must
      go to law and get it, if he will not give it up. What do you
      think of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friend.</i> It is precisely what any fool could have told
      you. But how much did you pay for this precious information?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Only five dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friend.</i> How much was the ring worth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Why, two dollars, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friend.</i> Then you have paid ten dollars for a chaise to
      bring you here, five dollars for the information that you had
      already, and all this to gain possession of a ring not worth
      one quarter of the expense!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Oh, the rascal! how he has cheated me! I will
      go to the world's end but I will be revenged.

      <i>Friend.</i> You had better go home, and say nothing about
      it; for every effort to recover your money, will only expose
      your folly.

      FAITH, HOPE, AND CHARITY.&mdash;AN ALLEGORY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [Footnote: AL' LE GO RY is a word of Greek origin. It is made
      up of two parts; ALL, <i>other</i>; and EGORY,
      <i>discourse</i>; the literal meaning of the compound being,
      <i>discourse</i> about <i>other</i> things; that is, things
      other than those expressed by the words, literally
      interpreted. Allegory is, therefore, the general name for
      that class of compositions, as <i>Fables</i>,
      <i>Apologues</i>, <i>Parables</i>, and <i>Myth</i>, in which
      there is a <i>double</i> signification, one <i>literal</i>
      and the other <i>figurative</i>; the literal being designed
      merely to give a more clear and impressive view of that which
      is figurative.]
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Many years ago, three beautiful sisters came into our
      world to lighten the burdens of earth's toiling pilgrims, and
      aid them in preparation for a higher state of existence.
      Alike commissioned by the Great Father, they were sent on
      errands of mercy, and were not to turn away from scenes of
      darkness, sorrow, and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FAITH had a firm, unfaltering step; HOPE, a beaming eye,
      ever turned to the future; and LOVE, a pitying glance, and a
      helping hand. They journeyed confidingly together; and when
      they found a stricken being in danger of perishing by the
      wayside, FAITH soothingly whispered, "My Father doeth all
      things well;" HOPE pointed to the cooling shade just in
      advance; and LOVE assisted him to rise, and aided his feeble
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Groups of fair children played near the path in which they
      were traveling. Some of these did not understand the tones of
      FAITH; but they all listened eagerly to the alluring strains
      of HOPE, who painted brighter scenes than those they were
      enjoying, and flowers more fragrant than any they yet had
      gathered. LOVE delighted to linger with the youthful band,
      lessening their trials, and increasing their pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Her gentle touch arrested the little hand that was lifted
      against a playmate, and her soothing voice calmed the angry
      passions which were swelling in the bosom. When a child
      stumbled in the way, she tenderly raised it up again, or when
      a thorn pierced the unwary finger, she kindly removed it, and
      bound up the bleeding wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. While the sisters were busy in their appropriate mission,
      a pale-cheeked lad mingled with the group of merry children,
      though too weak to share their sports. FAITH stole to his
      side, and whispered of the great Parent above, who afflicts
      in wisdom, and chastens in love. His eye brightened while she
      spoke, and he looked upward with that trust and submission
      which he had never before experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Then HOPE came, with visions of returning health, when his
      frame would be strong and his heart buoyant. But when HOPE
      and FAITH were gone, again his head drooped, and the tear
      started. Then LOVE sat down by the invalid, twining a garland
      of summer blossoms for his pale brow, and singing sweet
      melodies which charmed his listening ear. The pain was all
      gone now; smiles wreathed his pallid lips, and the sick boy
      laughed as merrily as his more robust companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The sisters, in their journeyings, entered the abode of
      poverty. It was a humble dwelling, and yet it looked
      cheerful, yea, even inviting, when the three graced it with
      their presence. FAITH shed a spirit of calm contentment and
      heavenly trust in those lowly walls; HOPE whispered of the
      better mansions prepared for the followers of the Lamb; and
      LOVE, not less exalted than her sisters, threw a charm over
      the meager fare and scanty attire of the inmates. FAITH
      taught them to offer the daily prayer in trusting confidence;
      HOPE pointed beyond this world to joys which eye hath not
      seen, nor ear heard; while LOVE lessened each burden, and
      increased each simple pleasure. FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY! ye,
      indeed, can make a paradise of the humblest home!
    </p>
    <p>
      8. There was a darkened chamber, with a wan form tossing
      restlessly upon the couch. Wealth was there; but it could not
      allay pain, or prolong life. FAITH, noiseless as a spirit
      form, glided to the sick one's side. "Though He slay me, yet
      will I trust in Him," was her language, as she pointed
      upward. HOPE fain would have whispered of length of days, but
      she knew this could not be; so she spoke of life eternal,
      where there is no more pain. Then LOVE smoothed the pillow,
      and bathed the fevered brow, pausing not in her tender
      ministries through the night-watches. When morning dawned,
      the spirit of the sick man passed away, though not until
      FAITH, and HOPE, and LOVE had assuaged the anguish of the
      parting pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Weeping mourners gathered around the dead. There were
      tears,&mdash;for "tears well befit earth's partings;" there
      was sorrow,&mdash;for what bitterness is like unto that of
      the bereaved, when the grave opens to infold the heart's best
      treasure? Yet FAITH, and HOPE, and LOVE were there, assuaging
      those tears, and mitigating that sorrow. FAITH, even while
      her cheeks were wet, exclaimed, "The Lord gave, and the Lord
      hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      10. HOPE'S language was, "Not lost, but gone before;" and her
      eye, having lost none of its brightness, saw with prophetic
      vision a reunion yet to come. LOVE tenderly wiped away each
      gathering tear, and gave deeper fervency to the trusting
      confidence of FAITH, and the inspiring strains of HOPE. And
      when the sleeper was committed to the dust, these gentle
      sisters lingered in the lonely house, and by the darkened
      hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Such are FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY,&mdash;given by God to
      lighten human sorrow, and bless the creatures He has made.
      They have each a mission to fulfill,&mdash;different, it is
      true, and yet they move in harmony. FAITH enables us to
      submit trustingly to daily trials, viewing a kind Father's
      hand in each passing event. HOPE, when the sky is dark, and
      the path thorny, points not only to fairer scenes below, but
      to that brighter world where there is no night and no sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. LOVE lightens every burden, and reflects upon earth a
      faint radiation of heavenly blessedness,&mdash;for the
      Scriptures assure us that "God is love: and every one that
      loveth is born of God." The time will come when, the purposes
      of the wise Creator being accomplished, Faith and Hope will
      cease. Faith will be lost in sight, Hope in fruition; but
      Love will remain, binding the spirits of the redeemed in
      blissful communion, and uniting them to God the Father and
      Christ the Elder Brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Faith, Hope, and Charity! blessed spirits! May they be
      inmates of every heart! May they assist each of us in the
      peculiar trials which none can know but ourselves! They will
      come to us if we seek their presence; but they must be
      carefully nurtured. Let us cherish them in our bosoms, and
      they will bless us constantly in our pilgrimage below, and
      conduct us to the presence of our God.

      "NOT TO MYSELF ALONE."
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      S.W. PARTRIDGE.
    </p>
    <pre>
    1. "<i>Not to myself alone,</i>"
  The little opening flower transported cries.
    "Not to myself alone I bud and bloom;
    With fragrant breath the breezes I perfume,
  And gladden all things with my rainbow dyes.
    The bee comes sipping, every eventide,
        His dainty fill;
    The butterfly within my cup doth hide
        From threatening ill."
    2. "<i>Not to myself alone,</i>"
  The circling star with honest pride doth boast,
    "Not to myself alone I rise and set;
    I write upon night's coronal of jet
  His power and skill who formed our myriad host;
    A friendly beacon at heaven's open gate,
        I gem the sky.
    That man might ne'er forget, in every fate,
        His home on high."
    3. "<i>Not to myself alone</i>,"
  The heavy-laden bee doth murmuring hum,
    "Not to myself alone, from flower to flower,
    I rove the wood, the garden, and the bower,
  And to the hive at evening weary come;
    For man, for man, the luscious food I pile
        With busy care,
    Content if he repay my ceaseless toil
        With scanty share."
    4. "<i>Not to myself alone</i>,"
  The soaring bird with lusty pinion sings,
    "Not to myself alone I raise my song;
    I cheer the drooping with my warbling tongue,
  And bear the mourner on my viewless wings;
    I bid the hymnless churl my anthem learn,
        And God adore;
    I call the worldling from his dross to turn,
        And sing and scar."
    5. <i>"Not to myself alone,"</i>
  The streamlet whispers on its pebbly way,
    "Not to myself alone I sparkling glide;
    I scatter health and life on every side,
  And strew the fields with herb and floweret gay.
    I sing unto the common, bleak and bare,
        My gladsome tune;
    I sweeten and refresh the languid air
        In droughty June."
    6. <i>"Not to myself alone:"</i>--
  O man, forget not thou,--earth's honored priest,
    Its tongue, its soul, its life, its pulse, its heart,--
    In earth's great chorus to sustain <i>thy</i> part!
  Chiefest of guests at Love's ungrudging feast,
    Play not the niggard; spurn thy native clod,
        And <i>self</i> disown;
    Live to thy neighbor; live unto thy God;
<i>Not to thyself alone!</i>

    <h4>
      WINTER BEAUTY.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      HENRY WARD BEECHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It is the impression of many, that only in summer,
      including spring and autumn, of course, is the <i>country</i>
      desirable as a residence. The country in summer, and the city
      for the winter. It is true, that the winter gives attractions
      to the city, in endless meetings, lectures, concerts, and
      indoor amusements; but it is not true that the country loses
      all interest when the leaves are shed and the grass is gone.
      On the contrary, to one who has learned how to use his senses
      and his sensibilities, there are attractions in the winter of
      a peculiar kind, and pleasures which can be reaped only then.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It appears to me, that winter comes in to relieve the year
      of satiety. The mind grows sated with greenness. After eight
      or nine months of luxuriant growths, the eye grows accustomed
      to vegetation. To be sure, we never are less pleased with the
      wide prospect; with forms of noble trees, with towns and
      meadows, and with the whole aspect of nature. But it is the
      pleasure of one pampered. We lose the keen edge of hunger.
      The eye enjoys, without the relish of newness. We expect to
      enjoy. Every thing loses surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Of course, the sky is blue, the grass succulent, the
      fields green, the trees umbrageous, the clouds silent and
      mysterious. They were so yesterday, they are so to-day, they
      will be so to-morrow, next week, next month. In short, the
      mind does not cease to feel the charm of endless growths; but
      needs variety, change of diet, less of perpetual feasting,
      and something of the blessings of a fast. <i>This</i> winter
      gives. It says to us: You have had too much. You are
      luxurious and dainty. You need relief and change of diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The cold blue of the sky, the cold gray of rocks, the
      sober warmth of browns and russets, take the place of more
      gorgeous colors. If, now, one will accept this change in the
      tone of nature, after a time a new and relishful pleasure
      arises. The month formed by the last fortnight of November
      and the first two weeks of December, is, to me, the saddest
      of the year. It most nearly produces the sense of
      desolateness and dreariness of any portion of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. From the hour that the summer begins to shorten its days,
      and register the increasing change along the horizon, over
      which the sun sets, farther and farther toward the south, we
      have a genial and gentle sadness. But sadness belongs to all
      very deep joys. It is almost as needful to the perfectness of
      joy, as shadows in landscapes are to the charm of the
      picture. Then, too, comes the fading out of
      flowers,&mdash;each variety in its turn, saying, "Farewell
      till next summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Scarcely less suggestive of departing summer are the
      new-comers, the late summer golden-rod, the asters, and all
      autumnal flowers. Long experience teaches us that these are
      the latest blossoms that fall from the sun's lap, and next to
      them is snow. By association we already see white in the
      yellow and blue. Then, too, birds are thinking of other
      things. No more nests, no more young, no more
      songs,&mdash;except signal-notes and rallying-calls; for they
      are evidently warned, and go about their little remaining
      daily business, as persons who expect every hour to depart to
      a distant land.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It is scarcely ever that we see the birds <i>go</i>. They
      are here to-day, and gone to-morrow. They disappear without
      observation. The fields are empty and silent. It seems as if
      the winds had blown them away with the leaves. The first
      sight of northern waterfowl, far up in the air, retreating
      from Labrador and the short, Arctic summer, is always to us
      like the declaration: "Summer is gone; winter is behind us;
      it will soon be upon you." At last come the late days of
      November. All is gone,&mdash;frosts reap and glean more
      sharply every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. A few weeks bring earnest winter. Then begin to dawn other
      delights. The bracing air, the clean snow-paths, the sled and
      sleigh, the revelation of forms that all summer were
      grass-hidden; the sharp-outlined hills lying clear upon the
      sky; the exquisite tracery of trees,&mdash;especially of all
      such trees as that dendral child of God, the elm, whose
      branches are carried out into an endless complexity of fine
      lines of spray, and which stands up in winter, showing in its
      whole anatomy, that all its summer shade was founded upon the
      most substantial reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. In winter, too, particularly in the latter periods of it,
      the extremities of shrubs and branches begin to take on ruddy
      hues, or purplish browns, and the eye knows that these are
      the first faint blushes of coming summer. Now, too, we find
      how beautiful are the mosses in the woods; and under them we
      find solitary green leaves, that have laughed all winter
      because they had outwitted the frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Wherever flowing springs gush from sheltered spots
      looking south, one will find many green edges, young grass,
      and some few tougher leaves. Now, too, in still days, the
      crow swings heavily through the air, cawing with a pleasing
      harshness. For dieting has performed its work. Your appetite
      is eager. A little now pleases you more than abundance did in
      August. Every tiny leaf is to you like a cedar of Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. All these things are unknown to dwellers in cities. It is
      nothing to them that a robin appeared for the first time
      yesterday morning, or that a blue-bird sang over against the
      house. Some new <i>prima-donna</i>[Footnote: The first female
      singer in an opera.] exhausts their admiration. They are yet
      studying laces, and do not care for the fringe of swamps, for
      the first catkins of the willow. They are still coveting the
      stores of precious stones at the jewelers, and do not care
      for my ruby buds, and red dogwood, and scarlet winter
      berries, and ground pine, and partridge-berry leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. There is one sight of the country, at about this time of
      the year&mdash;the first of March&mdash;that few have seen,
      or else they have passed it by as if it were not worthy of
      record. I mean the drapery of rocks in gorges, or along
      precipitous sides of hills or mountains. The seams of rocks
      are the outlets of springs. The water, trickling through, is
      seized by the frost, and held fast in white enchantment.
      Every day adds to the length of the ice drapery; and, as the
      surface is overlaid by new issuings, it is furred and fretted
      with silver-white chasings, the most exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Thus, one may find a succession, in a single gorge, of
      extraordinary ice-curtains, and pendent draperies, of varying
      lengths, of every fantastic form, of colors varying by
      thickness, or by the tinge of earth or rock shining through
      them. In my boyhood, I used to wander along these fairy
      halls, imagining them to be now altars in long, white
      draperies; now, grand cathedral pillars of white marble;
      then, long tapestries chased in white, with
      arabesques[Headnote 1] and crinkled vines and leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Sometimes they seemed like gigantic bridal decorations,
      or like the robes of beings vast and high, hung in their
      wardrobes while they slept. But, whatever fancy interpreted
      them, or whether they were looked upon with two good, sober,
      literal eyes, they were, and still are, among the most
      delightful of winter exhibitions, to those who are wise
      enough to search out the hidden beauty of winter in the
      country.

      FROSTED TREES.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1.<br>
       "Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasured snow,<br>
       Or winds begun their hazy skies to blow,<br>
       At evening, a keen eastern breeze arose,<br>
       And the descending rain unsullied froze.<br>
       Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew,<br>
       The ruddy morn disclosed at once to view<br>
       The face of Nature in a rich disguise,<br>
       And brightened every object to my eyes.<br>
       For every shrub, and every blade of grass,<br>
       And every pointed thorn, seemed wrought in glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Since Sunday, [Feb. 1st, 1852,] we have had presented to
      our view, the beautiful phenomenon of FROSTED TREES, the most
      astonishing and brilliant that I ever remember to have
      noticed. The previous storm and mist had thickly covered
      every exposed object,&mdash;the loftiest trees, the minutest
      blade, hill and dale, with the icy garment. This transparency
      was most perfect, defining every form and ramification into
      exact models of the entire body, branch, or limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Dwellings and barns were incrusted by the chilling vapor.
      It hung upon the manes of the cattle, and decorated, wherever
      seen, the humble grass, which appeared bending, like threads
      of crystal. The small bushes were indescribably beautiful,
      and seemed as if chiseled out of the whitest marble. As far
      as the eye could extend, over brooks, fields, and woods, the
      same striking and singular sight was universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. I could not remain contented in the house, and toward
      sunset, hastened away, where the view might be free and
      uninterrupted. Here, the scene, if possible, was more
      impressive and interesting. There was scarcely a breath of
      air, and the general silence was only interrupted by the
      occasional flight of some winter bird, which, alighting on a
      limb, would shake down a thousand feathery showers, until he
      seemed frightened at the unusual sound. The forest trees made
      a truly majestic appearance, with their naked, giant arms and
      mossy branches intersecting each other, and fast bound by the
      frozen barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. I shall not attempt to describe the brilliancy of the
      undergrowth and dwarf trees, upon whose limbs hung a delicate
      frosting, like unwrought silver, nor the crimson glow of the
      holly-berries through their transparent and icy
      covering,&mdash;all, all was a dazzling and splendid winter
      array,
    </p>
    <pre>
"That buries wide the works of man."
</pre>
    <p>
      It brought to my mind some of the Eastern fairy tales, and
      their gardens ornamented with shrubs and plants of sparkling
      crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The exposed sides of the rocks and fences were completely
      iced over, not the smallest particle escaping the penetrating
      and congealed ether. It was truly astonishing to examine its
      thickness. On some twigs, not larger than a wheat straw, the
      ice measured half an inch through. One would scarcely imagine
      what an immense weight of the frozen mass a tree will
      sustain, before it breaks under the unusual load. Many
      branches were bent so low that I could reach them with my
      hands; and, shaking off their frosted barks, they would
      instantly spring far above my reach. Every few minutes, I was
      startled by the rattling noise of these falling icicles from
      some neighboring tree or grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Just when the sun went down, there was not a single cloud
      to be seen in the horizon, and his cold, bright, setting rays
      brought out, on every hand, frozen gems, diamonds, rubies,
      and sapphires, in every possible prismatic beauty, wherever
      his departing beams fell. Presently the moon bathed the
      whitened earth, and every congealed drop, in her soft light,
      burnishing, with dazzling icy brilliancy, trees, dwellings,
      and streams. I am an ardent lover of Nature and her scenery,
      and have often, delighted, gazed upon the Queen of Night; but
      <i>never</i> did I behold such a brilliant moonlight night as
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Who could help bringing to mind the sublimities of Job and
      of David,&mdash;"The hoary frost of heaven, who hath
      engendered it? The waters are hid, as with a stone, and the
      face of the deep is frozen."&mdash;"By the breath of the
      Mighty God, ice is produced, and the waters which were spread
      on all sides, are held in chains." The Psalmist says, "He
      giveth the snow like wool, He scattereth the hoar-frost like
      ashes. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."&mdash;Well
      may poets look to the falling snow-flake for their images of
      purity and innocence, ere it receives the stain of earth. I
      know of no litter emblem.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Such a winter's night! <i>and the skies! the skies!</i> So
      resplendent in brightness are the hosts of heaven at this
      moment, that they should be contemplated by every lover and
      student of the works of God. Their numbers who can
      count,&mdash;their twinkling beauty who can describe, as
      onward they roll in the deep blue of midnight? In their
      contemplation are inspired "thoughts that wander through
      eternity," with an elevation of feeling, as if we were
      separated from the toils and tumults of earth, and exalted
      into a higher state of being than that in which we toiled
      through the day! These heavens tell us of a WISDOM and POWER
      we can not search or estimate. There we seem to stand more
      immediately in the vailed presence of the Infinite Majesty,
      who "laid the foundations of the earth, when the morning
      stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for
      joy."

   'Tis the land of our God, 'tis the home of the soul,

     On the evergreen Mountains of Life.
2. Our gaze can not soar to that beautiful land,
     But our visions have told of its bliss;
   And our souls by the gale from its gardens are fanned,
     When we faint in the desert of this;
   And we sometimes have longed for its holy repose,
   When our spirits were torn with temptations and woes,
   And we've drank from the tide of the river that flows
     From the evergreen Mountains of Life.
3. Oh! the stars never tread the blue heavens at night,
     But we think where the ransomed have trod;
   And the day never smiles from his palace of light,
     But we feel the bright smile of our God.
   We are traveling homeward, through changes and gloom,
   To a kingdom where pleasures unceasingly bloom,
   And our guide is the glory that shines through the tomb,
   From the evergreen Mountains of Life.

    <pre>
1. Sir Walter of Thurn, over the Syrian waste,
     Rides away with a flowing rein;
   But he hears a groan that checks his haste,
     As if death were in the strain.
         He spurs his steed
         Whence the sounds proceed;
     And there, from a rocky chasm, arise
     Fierce cries of pain, that assail the skies;
         And his horse uprears
         In excess of fears,
     As the glance of a lion attracts his eyes.
2. Fierce struggling there in the monster folds
     Of a serpent that round him twines;
   Sir Walter a moment the scene beholds,
     Then to save the beast inclines.
         His good sword stout
         From its sheath leaps out,
     When down it falls on the Python's[Headnote 1] crest,
     And cleaves the coils that the lion invest;
         And the noble beast,
         From its thrall released,
     Shows grateful joy most manifest.
3. He shakes his mane, and bends his form,
     And licks his preserver's hand,
   As if he yields allegiance warm
     To his supreme command.
         Like the faithful hound
         To be constant found,
     And follow his steps for evermore;
     And thus he follows, on sea and shore,
         In the battle's tide,
         He stands by his side,
     Or with him rests when the strife is o'er.
4. In Palestine Sir Walter is known,&mdash;
     Long years attest his fame;
   And many brave deeds he there hath done,
     That ray with glory his name;
         But his heart doth expand
         For the fatherland,
     And he fain its pleasant scenes would see,
     With his friendly lion for company;
         But with fearful breast,
         The sailors protest,
     As they glanced at the beast and his majesty.
5. Rich guerdon he proffers, and golden store;
     But though the prize were great,
   The sailors hurry away from the shore
     As if from the doom of fate.
         The poor beast moans
         In piteous tones,
     Then darts impetuously o'er the sands,&mdash;
     Then looks to the ship, and mournfully stands;
     Then plunges into the gloomy wave,
     The perils of the depths to brave.
     Already he nears the flying bark,
     Already his roar of grief they hark;
     But his strength is spent, and the sea is strong,
     And he may not the fearful struggle prolong.
     His dying glances are fondly cast
     Along the track where the loved one passed;
         Then sinks to his grave
         Beneath the wave,
     And the night and the ocean behold him the last.

      A smooth sea never made a skillful mariner. Neither do
      uninterrupted prosperity and success qualify man for
      usefulness or happiness. The storms of adversity, like the
      storms of the ocean, rouse the faculties and excite the
      invention, prudence, skill, and fortitude of the voyager.

      If you do not begin, you will never come to the end. The
      first weed pulled up in the garden, the first seed set in the
      ground, the first dollar put in the savings-bank, and the
      first mile traveled on a journey, are all important things;
      they make a <i>beginning</i>, and thereby give a hope, a
      promise, a pledge, an assurance that you are in earnest in
      what you have undertaken. How many a poor, idle, erring,
      hesitating outcast is now creeping his way through the world,
      who might have held up his head and prospered, if, instead of
      putting off his resolutions of amendment and industry, he had
      only made a beginning!

      1. Note the ecstatic joy of the student, who has labored long
      over a problem or proposition, but finally comes to a logical
      conclusion; who has struggled with the misty darkness of his
      own mind, for a clear view of some difficult subject, until
      the clouds, one after another, have dispersed, and he
      beholds, with his mental vision, in bright and glorious
      light, the conception for which he labored. Think you he
      would exchange his joys for the pleasures of sense'? It is of
      a higher and more ennobling character, and not to be bartered

    <h4>
      CAPTURE OF THE WHALE.
    </h4>
    <p>
      1. Let the reader suppose himself on the deck of a
      South-seaman, cruising in the North Pacific ocean. He may be
      musing over some past event, the ship may be sailing gently
      along over the smooth ocean, every thing around solemnly
      still, with the sun pouring its intense rays with dazzling
      brightness. Suddenly the monotonous quietude is broken by an
      animated voice from the masthead, exclaiming, <i>"There he
      spouts!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The captain starts on deck in an instant, and inquires
      <i>"Where away?"</i> but, perhaps, the next moment every one
      aloft and on deck, can perceive an enormous whale lying about
      a quarter of a mile from the ship, on the surface of the sea,
      having just come up to breathe,&mdash;his large "hump"
      projecting three feet out of the water. At the end of every
      ten seconds, the spout is seen rushing from the fore part of
      his enormous head, followed by the cry of every one on board,
      who join in the chorus of <i>"There again!"</i> keeping time
      with the duration of the spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. But, while they have been looking, a few seconds have
      expired. They rush into the boats, which are directly lowered
      to receive them; and in two minutes from the time of first
      observing the whale, three or four boats are down, and are
      darting through the water with their utmost speed toward
      their intended victim, perhaps accompanied with a song from
      the headsman, who urges the quick and powerful plying of the
      oar, with the common whaling chant of
    </p>
    <pre>
"Away, my boys, away, my boys, 'tis time for us to go."
</pre>
    <p>
      4. But, while they are rushing along, the whale is breathing;
      they have yet, perhaps, some distance to pull before they can
      get a chance of striking him with the harpoon. His "spoutings
      are nearly out," he is about to descend, or he hears the
      boats approaching. The few sailors left on board, and who are
      anxiously watching the whale and the gradual approach of the
      boats, exclaim, <i>"Ah, he is going down!"</i> Yet he spouts
      again, but slowly, the water is seen agitated around him; the
      spectators on board with breathless anxiety think they
      perceive him rising in preparation for his descent. <i>"He
      will be lost!"</i> they exclaim; for the boats are not yet
      near enough to strike him, and the men are still bending
      their oars in each boat with all their strength, to claim the
      honor of the first blow with the harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The bow-boat has the advantage of being the nearest to the
      whale; the others, for fear of disturbing the unconscious
      monster, are now ordered to drop astern. One more spout is
      seen slowly curling forth,&mdash;it is his last; but the boat
      shoots rapidly alongside of the gigantic creature. <i>"Peak
      your oars!"</i> exclaims the mate, and directly they flourish
      in the air; the glistening harpoon is seen above the head of
      the harpooner. In an instant it is darted with unerring force
      and aim, and is buried deeply in the side of the huge animal.
      It is "socket up;" that is, it is buried in his flesh up to
      the socket which admits the handle or pole of the harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. A cheer from those in the boats, and from the seamen on
      board, reverberates along the still deep at the same moment.
      The sea, which a moment before was unruffled, now becomes
      lashed into foam by the immense strength of the wounded
      whale, which, with its vast tail, strikes in all directions
      at his enemies. Now his enormous head rises high into the
      air, then his flukes are seen lashing everywhere, his huge
      body writhes in violent contortions from the agony the
      harpoon has inflicted. The water all around him is a mass of
      foam, and the sounds of the blows from his tail on the
      surface of the sea, can be heard for miles!
    </p>
    <p>
      7. <i>"Stern all!"</i> cries the headsman; but the whale
      suddenly disappears; he has "sounded;" the line is running
      through the groove at the head of the boat, with
      lightning-like velocity; it smokes; it ignites from the heat
      produced by the friction; but the headsman, cool and
      collected, pours water upon it as it passes. But an oar is
      now held up in their boat; it signifies that their line is
      rapidly running out; two hundred fathoms are nearly
      exhausted; up flies one of the other boats, and "bends on"
      another line, just in time to save that which was nearly
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. But still the monster descends; he is seeking to rid
      himself of his enemies by descending deeply into the dark and
      unknown depths of the vast ocean. Two more lines are
      exhausted,&mdash;he is <i>six hundred fathoms deep! "Stand
      ready to bend on!"</i> cries the mate to the fourth boat;
      (for sometimes they take the whole four lines away with
      them,&mdash;<i>eight hundred fathoms!!</i>) but, it is not
      required, he is rising. <i>"Haul in the slack!"</i> observes
      the headsman, while the boat-steerer coils it again carefully
      into the tubs as it is drawn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The whale is now seen approaching the surface; the
      gurgling and bubbling water which rises, proclaims that he is
      near; his nose starts from the sea; the rushing spout is
      projected high and suddenly, from his agitation. The slack of
      the line is now coiled in the tubs, and those in the fast
      boat, haul themselves gently toward the whale. The
      boat-steerer places the headsman close to the fin of the
      trembling animal, who immediately buries his long lance in
      the vitals of the leviathan, while, at the same moment, those
      in one of the other boats, dart another harpoon into his
      opposite side. Then, <i>"Stern all!"</i> is again
      vociferated, and the boats shoot rapidly away from the
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Mad with the agony which he endures from these fresh
      attacks, the infuriated "sea monster" rolls over and over,
      and coils an amazing length of line around him. He rears his
      enormous head, and, with wide-expanded jaws, snaps at every
      thing around him. He rushes at the boats with his
      head,&mdash;they are propelled before him with vast
      swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. He is lanced again,&mdash;and his pain appears more than
      he can bear. He throws himself, in his agony, completely out
      of his element; the boats are violently jerked, by which one
      of the lines is snapped asunder; at the same time the other
      boat is upset, and its crew are swimming for their lives. The
      whale is now free! he passes along the surface with
      remarkable swiftness, "going head out;" but the two boats
      that have not yet "fastened," and are fresh and free, now
      give chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The whale becomes exhausted from the blood which flows
      from his deep and dangerous wounds, and the two hundred
      fathoms of line belonging to the overturned boat, which he is
      dragging after him through the water, checks him in his
      course; his pursuers again overtake him, and another harpoon
      is darted and buried deeply in his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The fatal lance is, at length, given; the blood gushes
      from the nostrils of the unfortunate animal in a thick, black
      stream, which stains the clear blue water of the ocean to a
      considerable distance around the scene of the affray. The
      immense creature may now again endeavor to "sound," to escape
      from his unrelenting pursuers; but he is powerless. He soon
      rises to the surface, and passes slowly along until the
      death-pang seizes him, when his appearance is awful in the
      extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Suffering from suffocation, or from the stoppage of some
      important organ, the whole strength of his enormous frame is
      set in motion, for a few seconds, when his convulsions throw
      him into a hundred different contortions of the most violent
      description, by which the sea is beaten into foam, and boats
      are sometimes crushed to atoms, with their crews.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. But this violent action being soon over, the now
      unconscious animal passes rapidly along, describing in his
      rapid course the segment of a circle; this is his "flurry,"
      which ends in his sudden dissolution. The mighty rencounter
      is finished. The gigantic animal rolls over on his side, and
      floats an inanimate mass on the surface of the crystal
      deep,&mdash;a victim to the tyranny and selfishness, as well
      as a wonderful proof of the <i>great power of the mind of
      man</i>.

    <p class="rauth">
      WILLIS GAYLORD CLARK.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. My hour had now come, and I entered the car. With a
      singular taste, the band struck up, at this moment, the
      melting air of "Sweet Home." It almost overcame me. A
      thousand associations of youth, friends, of all that I must
      leave, rushed upon my mind. But I had no leisure for
      sentiment. A buzz ran through the assemblage; unnumbered
      hands were clapping, unnumbered hearts beating high; and
      <i>I</i> was the cause. Every eye was upon me. There was
      pride in the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. "Let go!" was the word. The cheers redoubled;
      handkerchiefs waved from many a fair hand; bright faces
      beamed from every window, and on every side. One dash with my
      knife, and I rose aloft, a habitant of air. How magnificent
      was the sight which now burst upon me! How sublime were my
      sensations! I waved the flag of my country; the cheers of the
      multitude from a thousand housetops, reached me on the
      breeze; and a taste of the rarer atmosphere elevated my
      spirits into ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The city, with a brilliant sunshine striking the spires
      and domes, now unfolded to view a sight incomparably
      beautiful. My gondola went easily upward, cleaving the depths
      of heaven like a vital thing. A diagram placed before you, on
      the table, could not permit you to trace more definitely than
      I now could, the streets, the highways, basins, wharves, and
      squares of the town. The hum of the city arose to my ear, as
      from a vast bee-hive; and I seemed the monarch-bee, directing
      the swarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. I heard the rattling of carriages, the hearty
      <i>yo-heavo-s!</i> of sailors from the docks that, begirt
      with spars, hemmed the city round. I was a spectator of all,
      yet aloof, and alone. Increasing stillness attended my way;
      and, at last, the murmurs of earth came to my ear like the
      vast vibrations of a bell. My car tilted and trembled, as I
      rose. A swift wind sometimes gave the balloon a rotary
      motion, which made me deathly sick for a moment; but strong
      emotion conquered all my physical ailings.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. My brain ached with the intensity of my rapture. Human
      sounds had fainted from my ear. I was in the abyss of heaven,
      and <i>alone</i> with my God. I could tell my direction by
      the sun on my left; and, as his rays played on the aerostat,
      it seemed only a bright bubble, wavering in the sky, and I, a
      suspended mote, hung by chance to its train. Looking below
      me, the distant Sound and Long Island appeared to the east;
      the bay lay to the south, sprinkled with shipping; under me,
      the city, girded with bright rivers and sparry forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The free wind was on my cheek, and in my locks; afar, the
      ocean rolled its long, blue waves, checkered with masses of
      shadow, and gushes of ruby sunlight; to the north and west,
      the interminable land, variegated like a map, dotted with
      purple, and green, and silver, faded to the eye. The
      atmosphere which I now breathed, seemed to dilate my heart at
      every breath. I uttered some audible expressions. My voice
      was weaker than the faintest sound of a reed. There was no
      object near to make it reverb or echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. My barometer now denoted an immense hight; and, as I
      looked upward and around, the concave above seemed like a
      mighty waste of purple air, verging to blackness. Below, it
      was lighter; but a long, lurid bar of cloud stretched along
      the west, temporarily excluding the sun. The shadows rushed
      afar into the void, and a solemn, Sabbath twilight reigned
      around. I was now startled by a fluttering in my gondola. It
      was my carrier-pigeon. I had forgotten him entirely. I
      attached a string to his neck, with a label, announcing my
      hight, then nearly four miles, and the state of the
      barometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. As he sat on the side of the car, and turned his tender
      eyes upon me in mute supplication, every feather shivering
      with apprehension, I felt that it was a guilty act to push
      him into the waste beneath. But it was done; he attempted to
      rise, but I out-sped him; he then fell obliquely, fluttering
      and moaning, till I lost him in the haze. My greatest
      altitude had not yet been reached. I was now five miles from
      <i>terra firma</i>. [Footnote: Solid earth.] I began to
      breathe with difficulty. The atmosphere was too rare for safe
      respiration.

      9. I pulled my valve-cord to descend. It refused to obey my
      hand. For a moment I was horror-struck. What was to be done?
      If I ascended much higher, the balloon would explode. I threw
      over some tissue paper to test my progress. It is well known
      that this will <i>rise</i> very swiftly. It <i>fell</i>, as
      if blown downward by a wind from the zenith. I was going
      upward like an arrow. I attempted to pray, but my parched
      lips could not move. I seized the cord again, with desperate
      energy. Blessed Heaven! it moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. I threw out more tissue. It rose to me like a wing of
      joy. I was descending. Though far from sunset, it was now
      dark about me, except a track of blood-red haze in the
      direction of the sun. I encountered a strong current of wind;
      mist was about me; it lay like dew upon my coat. At last, a
      thick bar of vapor being past, what a scene was disclosed! A
      storm was sweeping through the sky, nearly a mile beneath;
      and I looked down upon an ocean of rainbows, rolling in
      indescribable grandeur, to the music of the thunder-peal, as
      it moaned afar and near, on the coming and dying wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. A frightened eagle had ascended through the tempest, and
      sailed for minutes by my side, looking at me with panting
      weariness, and quivering mandibles, but with a dilated eye,
      whose keen iris flashed unsubdued. Proud emblem of my
      country! As he fanned me with his heavy wing, and looked with
      a human intelligence at the car, my pulse bounded with
      exulting rapture. Like the genius of my native land, he had
      risen above every storm, unfettered and FREE.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. But my transports were soon at an end. He attempted to
      light on the balloon, and my heart sunk; I feared his huge
      claws would tear the silk. I pulled my cord; he rose, as I
      sank, and the blast swept him from my view in a moment. A
      flock of wild-fowl, beat by the storm, were coursing below,
      on bewildered pinions; and, as I was nearing them, I knew I
      was descending. A breaking rift now admitted the sun. The
      rainbows tossed and gleamed; chains of fleecy rack, shining
      in prismatic rays of gold, and purple, and emerald,
      "beautiful exceedingly," spread on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Vast curtains of clouds pavilioned the immensity,
      brighter than celestial roses; masses of mist were lifted on
      high, like strips of living fire, more radiant than the sun
      himself, when his glorious noontide culminates from the
      equator. A kind of a&euml;rial Euroclydon now smote my car,
      and three of the cords parted, which tilted my gondola to the
      side, filling me with terror. I caught the broken cords in my
      hand, but could not tie them.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. The storm below was now rapidly passing away, and beneath
      its waving outline, to the south-east, I saw the ocean. Ships
      were speeding on their course, and their bright sails melting
      into distance; a rainbow hung afar; and the rolling anthems
      of the Atlantic came like celestial hymnings to my ear.
      Presently all was clear below me. The fresh air played
      around. I had taken a noble circuit; and my last view was
      better than the first, I was far over the bay, "afloating
      sweetly to the west." The city, colored by the last blaze of
      day, brightened remotely to the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Below, ships were hastening to and fro through the
      Narrows, and the far country lay smiling like an Eden. Bright
      rivers ran like ribbons of gold and silver, till they were
      lost in the vast inland, stretching beyond the view; the
      gilded mountains were flinging their purple shadows over many
      a vale; bays were blushing to the farewell day-beams; and now
      I was passing over a green island. I sailed to the mainland;
      saw the tall, old trees waving to the evening breeze; heard
      the rural lowing of herds, and the welcome sound of human
      voices; and, finally, sweeping over forest-tops and embowered
      villages, at last, descended with the sun, among a
      kind-hearted, surprised, and hospitable community, in as
      pretty a town as one could desire to see, "safe and well."

      THE DAPPLE MARE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      JOHN G. SAXE.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. "Once on a time," as ancient tales declare,
      There lived a farmer in a quiet dell
    In Massachusetts, but exactly where,
      Or when, is really more than I can tell,&mdash;
    Except that quite above the public bounty,
      He lived within his means and Bristol county.
 2. By patient labor and unceasing care,
      He earned, and so enjoyed, his daily bread;
    Contented always with his frugal fare,
      Ambition to be rich ne'er vexed his head;
    And thus unknown to envy, want, or wealth,
      He flourished long in comfort, peace, and health.
 3. The gentle partner of his humble lot,
      The joy and jewel of his wedded life,
    Discharged the duties of his peaceful cot,
      Like a true woman and a faithful wife;
    Her mind improved by thought and useful reading,
      Kind words and gentle manners showed her breeding.
 4. Grown old, at last, the farmer called his son,
      The youngest, (and the favorite I suppose,) And said,&mdash;
    "I long have thought, my darling John,
      'Tis time to bring my labors to a close;
    So now to toil I mean to bid adieu,
      And deed, my son, the homestead-farm to you."
 5. The boy embraced the boon with vast delight,
      And promised, while their precious lives remained,
    He'd till and tend the farm from morn till night,
      And see his parents handsomely maintained;
    God help him, he would never fail to love, nor
      Do aught to grieve his gen'rous old gov'nor.
 6. The farmer said,&mdash;"Well, let us now proceed,
      (You know there's always danger in delay,)
    And get 'Squire Robinson to write the deed;
      Come,&mdash;where's my staff?&mdash;we'll soon be on the way."
    But John replied, with tender, filial care,
      "You're old and weak&mdash;I'll catch the Dapple Mare."
 7. The mare was saddled, and the old man got on,
      The boy on foot trudged cheerfully along,
    The while, to cheer his sire, the duteous son
      Beguiled the weary way with talk and song.
    Arrived, at length, they found the 'Squire at home,
      And quickly told him wherefore they had come.
 8. The deed was writ in proper form of law,
      With many a "foresaid," "therefore," and "the same,"
    And made throughout without mistake or flaw,
      To show that John had now a legal claim
    To all his father's land&mdash;conveyed, given, sold,
      Quit-claimed, et cetera,[Footnote 1]&mdash;to have and hold.
 9. Their business done, they left the lawyer's door,
      Happier, perhaps, than when they entered there;
    And started off as they had done before,&mdash;
      The son on foot, the father on the mare.
    But ere the twain a single mile had gone,
      A brilliant thought occurred to Master John.
10. Alas for truth!&mdash;alas for filial duty!&mdash;
      Alas that Satan in the shape of pride,
    (His most bewitching form save that of beauty,)
      Whispered the lad&mdash;"My boy, you ought to ride!"
    "Get off!" exclaimed the younker&mdash;"'t isn't fair
      That you should always ride the Dapple Mare!"
11. The son was lusty, and the sire was old,
      And so, with many an oath and many a frown,
    The hapless father did as he was told;
      The man got off the steed, the boy got on,
    And rode away as fast as she could trot,
      And left his sire to trudge it home on foot!
12. That night, while seated round the kitchen fire
      The household sat, cheerful as if no word
    Or deed, provoked the injured father's ire,
      Or aught to make him sad had e'er occurred,&mdash;
    Thus spoke he to his son: "We quite forgot,
      I think, t'include that little turnip lot!"
13. "I'm very sure, my son, it wouldn't hurt it,"
      Calmly observed the meditative sire,
    "To take the deed, my lad, and just insert it;"
      Here the old man inserts it&mdash;<i>in the fire!</i>
    Then cries aloud with most triumphant air,
      "Who now, my son, shall ride the Dapple Mare?"

      old gentleman do?

1. Old Ironsides at anchor lay,
(<i>sl</i>.) In the harbor of Mahon[1];
   A dead calm rested on the bay,&mdash;
     The waves to sleep had gone,&mdash;
   When little Jack,[2] the captain's son,
     With gallant hardihood,
   Climbed shroud and spar,&mdash;and then upon
     The main-truck rose and stood!
2. A shudder ran through every vein,&mdash;
     All eyes were turned on high!
   There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,
     Between the sea and sky!
   No hold had he above,&mdash;below,
     Alone he stood in air!
   At that far hight none dared to go,&mdash;
     No aid could reach him there.
3. We gazed,&mdash;but not a man could speak;
     With horror all aghast,
   In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,
     We watched the quivering mast!
   The atmosphere grew thick and hot,
     And of a lurid hue,
   As, riveted unto the spot,
     Stood officers and crew.
4. The father came on deck. He gasped,
     "O God, Thy will be done!"
   Then suddenly a rifle grasped,
     And aimed it at his son!
   "Jump far out, boy, into the wave!
     Jump, or I fire!" he said.
   "That only chance your life can save:
(<i>''</i>)  Jump! jump, boy!" He obeyed.
5. He sank,&mdash;he rose,&mdash;he lived,&mdash;he moved,&mdash;
     He for the ship struck out!
   On board we hailed the lad beloved
     With many a manly shout.
   His father drew, in silent joy,
     Those wet arms round his neck,
   Then folded to his heart the boy,
     And fainted on the deck!

      THE INDIAN BRIDE'S REVENGE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      L.M. STOWELL.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In the State of New York, where the dark, foaming waters
      of the Black River, after roaring and surging through many
      pleasant fields, beautiful groves, and dense woodlands,
      commingle with the clear, cold waters of Lake Ontario, the
      wandering pedestrian or the lone fisherman may see, resting
      upon a gravelly flat, the remains of an <i>old Indian
      canoe</i>, whose once beautiful proportions, now untraceable
      in its rottenness, bore a prominent part in the tragic event
      I am about to narrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Through these pleasant valleys, among the broken hills,
      and in the majestic forests, of yore, the wily Indian and his
      dusky mate, held undisputed possession; and many are the
      incidents, yet unwritten, of tragic and thrilling interest,
      that transpired around the red men's camp-fire, ere the white
      man disturbed their forest homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Si &ouml;us' ka, or the "Wild Flower," was the daughter of
      a powerful chief of the Onondagas, and the only being ever
      known to turn the relentless old chief from a savage purpose.
      Something of this influence was owing to her great beauty;
      but more to the gentleness of which that beauty was the
      emblem. Her downcast eye, her trembling lip, her quiet,
      submissive motion, all bespoke its language; and many were
      the young chieftains that sought to win her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Among her admirers were two young chiefs of the Oneidas,
      with whom the Onondagas were on the most friendly terms. Si
      &ouml;us' ka's father, in order to cherish the friendly
      feeling of the two tribes, and, at the same time, strengthen
      his power, besought her to accept the more powerful chief,
      "Eagle Eye." He did not plead in vain; for she had long loved
      the young Oneida.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. One bright sunny morning, in early spring, as the old
      chief was out hunting, the young Oneida crossed his path,
      upon which the old man advanced, and, laying his hand upon
      his shoulder, pointed to the dwelling of Si &ouml;us' ka. Not
      a word was spoken. The proud old man and the strong, young
      chief proceeded toward her wigwam, and entered together.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Si &ouml;us' ka was seated in one corner, engaged upon
      some fancy basket-work, and did not notice their approach
      until they had entered. The old chief looked upon her with an
      expression of love, which his stern countenance never wore
      except in her presence. "Si&ouml;us'ka," he said in a subdued
      tone, "Go to the wigwam of the Oneida, that your father's
      tribe may be strengthened, and many moons may shine upon
      their peace and prosperity."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There was mingled joy and modesty in the upward glance of
      the "Wild Flower" of the Onondagas, and, when the young chief
      saw the light of her mild eye suddenly and timidly vailed by
      its deeply-fringed lid, he knew that her love had lost none
      of its power. The marriage song was soon sung in the royal
      wigwam, in which the sweet voice of Si&ouml;us'ka was happily
      heard to mingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. When the rejected chief of the Oneidas heard that the
      "Wild Flower" had mated with the "Eagle Eye," his wrath knew
      no bounds, and he secretly resolved upon revenge. Two years
      passed away, and, as yet, no good opportunity had arrived;
      for he dared not attack "Eagle Eye" in open conflict, for
      fear of his superior powers; and, assassin-like, he sought to
      give the blow unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. At length, the spring came, and a number of the tribe
      prepared to visit Lake Ontario, on a fishing and hunting
      excursion. Among the number who went, were the "Eagle Eye,"
      Si&ouml;us'ka, and their little boy. They were obliged to
      carry their light, birchen canoes from home, and these were
      packed with the necessary tackle, skins for beds, &amp;c. The
      strong men of the party carried the canoes on their
      shoulders, and the women the smaller articles of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. They had advanced across the country, until they reached
      the Black River, and, by carrying their canoes around falls
      and rapids, gently floated down the stream till they reached
      the great falls, about six miles from the Lake. Here they
      halted for the night, and encamped about half a mile above
      the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The morning came; and, as the first beam of the rising
      sun pierced the forest shade, the party again embarked in
      their canoes for the mouth of the river, the gaudy canoe of
      Si ous' ka, which her father had given her, taking the lead.
      They had scarcely started from the shore, ere the sharp twang
      of a bow-string was heard from the shore, and an unerring
      arrow pierced the heart of "Eagle Eye." He fell over the side
      of the canoe, and was swept by the current over the great
      falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The party immediately started in pursuit of the coward
      murderer; but they sought in vain. His hiding-place was too
      sure,&mdash;he had taken refuge in a cave, the entrance of
      which was hid from observation by a thick clump of cedars.
      Here he remained till he was certain the company had
      departed. This cave is still there, and I have often been in
      its many chambers,&mdash;some of which are very spacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. The fatal shaft was winged from the bow of the revenged
      Oneida chief. Having been apprised of the expedition, he had
      warily dogged the steps of the party, until a favorable
      opportunity presented itself, and then satisfied his secret
      longing for revenge upon the enemy, whom he did not dare to
      attack even-handed. The party sought him far and near; but,
      as no trace of any one could be found, they imagined, with
      superstitious fear, that the "Great Spirit" had thus summoned
      "Eagle Eye" to the "Spirit's Hunting Ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      14. When they returned to their canoes, no traces of Si ous'
      ka and her child were to be found. They, too, had
      mysteriously disappeared, and the whole party, with ominous
      silence, hastened around the falls, and away from the fearful
      place. When Si ous' ka saw the fatal shaft pierce her
      companion, with, a fearful shriek she fell into the bottom of
      the canoe, hid herself in the furs, and immediately her
      reason forsook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. When she recovered, she found that her canoe, urged on by
      the current, had floated into a large cave, and was firmly
      wedged in between two rocks; and her little boy, with his bow
      and arrow in his hand, was quietly sleeping by her side.
      Dislodging the canoe, she plied the oars, and was soon
      outside the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. On finding her people had left her, she sought the shore,
      and, fastening the canoe, proceeded below the falls, where
      she found the body of the ill-fated "Eagle Eye," where it had
      washed ashore. With superhuman strength, she bore the mangled
      body to a thick grove of cedars, and, with her own hands, dug
      a rude grave, and covered his remains with dried leaves and
      earth. That night she kept her lonely watch beside the grave
      of all that she held dear on earth, save her boy, intending
      to follow the party on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. The morning came, and the mid-day sun began to descend
      toward the western hills, ere she left the grave of the
      murdered chief. But, at length, she sorrowfully departed;
      and, on arriving where she moored the canoe the day before,
      what was her surprise to see the murderer of her husband,
      quietly sleeping upon the skins where last "Eagle Eye" had
      reposed, in the bow of the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. From that moment Si &ouml;us' ka was changed. Her quiet,
      submissive air immediately gave place to fierce sternness,
      and the eye that had always beamed with the smile of love,
      shot forth flashes of bitter hate and passion, implacable as
      the most bloodthirsty of her tribe. Noiselessly throwing the
      oars from the boat, with a wild shriek, she quickly swung it
      around into the rapidly rolling current, and it was hurried
      toward the brink of that awful cataract, over which no living
      being had ever passed alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. The young chief, awakened by that fearful, exulting cry
      of revenge, and seeing the peril of his situation, leaped
      from the bark that was hurrying him to sure destruction, and
      vainly sought to gain the shore. After struggling with the
      swift tide for a moment, in which he was carried nearer and
      nearer the awful brink, he turned, and, with a wild,
      unearthly yell, plunged over, and the boiling waters only
      responded to his death-wail, as he sunk to rise no more, and
      his spirit joined that of his victim in the "Spirit Land."
    </p>
    <p>
      20. After the gentle "Wild Flower" had avenged the death of
      the "Eagle Eye," she returned to her father's wigwam, and
      spent the remainder of her life to the memory of her heart's
      first devotion. The canoe, all battered and broken, floated
      to the mouth of the river, bottom side up, where it was seen
      by one of the party while fishing, drawn to the shore, and
      left to decay. The party supposed that "Eagle Eye," Sious'ka,
      and her child, had all perished in some mysterious manner.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. Who was Sious'ka? 2. Who became her
      husband? 3. What effect had her marriage upon the rejected
      Oneida chief? 4. In what way did he seek revenge? 5. How did
      Sious'ka avenge the death of her husband?

    <h4>
      A MOTHER'S LOVE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      ALBERT BARNES.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Many of us who are advanced beyond the period of
      childhood, went out from home to embark on the stormy sea of
      life. Of the feelings of a father, and of his interest in our
      welfare, we have never entertained a doubt, and our home was
      dear because he was there; but there was a peculiarity in the
      feeling that it was the home of our mother. Where <i>she</i>
      lived, there was a place that we felt was <i>home</i>. There
      was <i>one place</i> where we would always be welcome, <i>one
      place</i> where we would be met with a smile, <i>one
      place</i> where we would be sure of a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The world might be indifferent to us. We might be
      unsuccessful in our studies or our business. The new friends
      which we supposed we had made, might prove to be false. The
      honor which we thought we deserved, might be withheld from
      us. We might be chagrined and mortified by seeing a rival
      outstrip us, and bear away the prize which we sought. But
      there <i>was</i> a place where no feelings of rivalry were
      found, and where those whom the world overlooked, would be
      sure of a friendly greeting. Whether pale and wan by study,
      care, or sickness, or flushed with health and flattering
      success, we were <i>sure</i> that we should be welcome there.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Though the world was cold toward us, yet there was
      <i>one</i> who always rejoiced in our success, and always was
      affected in our reverses; and there was a <i>place</i> to
      which we might go back from the storm which began to pelt us,
      where we might rest, and become encouraged and invigorated
      for a new conflict. So have I seen a bird, in its first
      efforts to fly, leave its nest, and stretch its wings, and go
      forth to the wide world. But the wind blew it back, and the
      rain began to fall, and the darkness of night began to draw
      on, and there was no shelter abroad, and it sought its way
      back to its nest, to take shelter beneath its mother's wings,
      and to be refreshed for the struggles of a new day; but then
      it flew away to think of its nest and its mother no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. But not thus did we leave our home when we bade adieu to
      it to go forth alone to the manly duties of life. Even amidst
      the storms that then beat upon us, and the disappointments
      that we met with, and the coldness of the world, we felt
      still that there <i>was one</i> who sympathized in our
      troubles, as well as rejoiced in our success, and that,
      whatever might be abroad, when we entered the door of her
      dwelling, we should be met with a smile. We expected that a
      mother, like the mother of Sisera[Headnote 1], as she "looked
      out at her window," waiting for the coming of her son laden
      with the spoils of victory, would look out for <i>our</i>
      coming, and that <i>our</i> return would renew her joy and
      ours in our earlier days.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. It makes a sad desolation when, from such a place, a
      mother is taken away, and when, whatever may be the sorrows
      or the successes in life, she is to greet the returning son
      or daughter no more. The home of our childhood may be still
      lovely. The old family mansion&mdash;the green
      fields&mdash;the running stream&mdash;the moss-covered
      well&mdash;the trees&mdash;the lawn&mdash;the rose&mdash;the
      sweet-brier&mdash;may be there. Perchance, too, there may be
      an aged father, with venerable locks, sitting in his
      loneliness, with every thing to command respect and love; but
      she is not there. Her familiar voice is not heard. The mother
      has been borne forth to sleep by the side of her children who
      went before her, and the place is not what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There may be those there whom we much love; but <i>she</i>
      is not there. We may have formed new relations in life,
      tender and strong as they can be; we may have another home,
      dear to us as was the home of our childhood, where there is
      all in affection, kindness, and religion, to make us happy;
      but <i>that</i> home is not what it was, and it will
      <i>never</i> be what it was again. It is a loosening of one
      of the cords which bound us to earth, designed to prepare us
      for our eternal flight from every thing dear here below, and
      to teach us that there is <i>no</i> place here, that is to be
      our permanent home.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What renders home doubly endearing? 2.
      Where are we always welcome? 3. Who always rejoices in our
      successes, and is affected in our reverses? 4. Who was
      Sisera, and what account is given of him?

      GETTING THE RIGHT START.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      J.G. HOLLAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The first great lesson a young man should learn, is, that
      <i>he knows nothing;</i> and that the earlier and more
      thoroughly this lesson is learned, the better it will be for
      his peace of mind, and his success in life. A young man bred
      at home, and growing up in the light of parental admiration
      and fraternal pride, can not readily understand how it is,
      that every one else can be his equal in talent and
      acquisition. If bred in the country, he seeks the life of the
      town, he will very early obtain an idea of his
      insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. This is a critical period in his history. The result of
      his reasoning will decide his fate. If, at this time, he
      thoroughly comprehend, and in his soul admit and accept the
      fact, that <i>he knows nothing</i> and <i>is nothing;</i> if
      he bow to the conviction that his mind and his person are but
      ciphers, and that whatever he is <i>to be</i>, and is <i>to
      win</i>, must be achieved by <i>hard work</i>, there is
      abundant hope of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If, on the contrary, a huge self-conceit still hold
      possession of him, and he straightens stiffly up to the
      assertion of his old and valueless self,&mdash;or, if he sink
      discouraged upon the threshold of a life of fierce
      competitions, and more manly emulations, he might as well be
      a dead man. The world has no use for such a man, and he has
      only to retire or be trodden upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. When a young man has thoroughly comprehended the fact that
      <i>he knows nothing</i>, and that, intrinsically, he is of
      but <i>little value</i>, the next thing for him to learn is
      that <i>the world cares nothing for him</i>,&mdash;that he is
      the subject of no man's overwhelming admiration and
      esteem,&mdash;that he must take care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If he be a stranger, he will find every man busy with his
      own affairs, and none to look after him. He will not be
      noticed until he becomes <i>noticeable</i>, and he will not
      become noticeable, until he <i>does something</i> to prove
      that he has an absolute value in society. No letter of
      recommendation will give him this, or ought to give him this.
      No family connection will give him this, except among those
      few who think more of blood than brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Society demands that a young man <i>shall be somebody</i>,
      not only, but that <i>he shall prove his right to the
      title</i>; and it has a right to demand this. Society will
      not take this matter upon trust,&mdash;at least, not for a
      long time; for it has been cheated too frequently. Society is
      not very particular what a man does, so that it prove him to
      be a <i>man</i>: then it will bow to him, and make room for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There is no surer sign of an unmanly and cowardly spirit,
      than a vague desire for <i>help</i>,&mdash;a wish to
      <i>depend</i>, to <i>lean</i> upon somebody, and enjoy the
      fruits of the industry of others. There are multitudes of
      young men who indulge in dreams of help from some quarter,
      coming in at a convenient moment, to enable them to secure
      the success in life which they covet. The vision haunts them
      of some benevolent old gentleman, with a pocket full of
      money, a trunk full of mortgages and stocks, and a mind
      remarkably appreciative of merit and genius, who will,
      perhaps, give or lend them from ten to twenty thousand
      dollars, with which they will commence and go on swimmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. To me, one of the most disgusting sights in the world, is
      that of a young man with healthy blood, broad shoulders, and
      a hundred and fifty pounds, more or less, of good bone and
      muscle, standing with his hands in his pockets, longing for
      help. I admit that there are positions in which the most
      independent spirit may accept of assistance,&mdash;may, in
      fact, as a choice of evils, desire it; but for a man who is
      able to help himself, to desire the help of others in the
      accomplishment of his plans of life, is positive proof that
      he has received a most unfortunate training, or that there is
      a leaven of meanness in his composition, that should make him
      shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. When, therefore, a young man has ascertained and fully
      received the fact that he does not know any thing, that the
      world does not care any thing about him, that what he wins
      must be won by his own brain and brawn, and that while he
      holds in his own hands the means of gaining his own
      livelihood and the objects of his life, he can not receive
      assistance without compromising his self-respect and selling
      his freedom, he is in a fair position for beginning life.
      When a young man becomes aware that only by <i>his own
      efforts</i> can he rise into companionship and competition
      with the sharp, strong, and well-drilled minds around him, he
      of ready for work, and not before.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The next lesson is, that of <i>patience</i>, thoroughness
      in preparation, and contentment with the regular channels of
      business effort and enterprise. This is, perhaps, one of the
      most difficult to learn, of all the lessons of life. It is
      natural for the mind to reach out eagerly for immediate
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. As manhood dawns, and the young man catches in its first
      light the pinnacles of realized dreams, the golden domes of
      high possibilities, and the purpling hills of great delights,
      and then looks down upon the narrow, sinuous, long, and dusty
      path by which others have reached them, he is apt to be
      disgusted with the passage, and to seek for success through
      broader channels, by quicker means. Beginning at the very
      foot of the hill, and working slowly to the top, seems a very
      discouraging process; and precisely at this point, have
      thousands of young men made shipwreck of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Let this be understood, then, at starting; that the
      patient conquest of difficulties, which rise in the regular
      and legitimate channels of business and enterprise, is not
      only essential in securing the successes which you seek, but
      it is essential to that preparation of your mind, requisite
      for the enjoyment of your successes, and for retaining them
      when gained. It is the general rule of Providence, the world
      over, and in all time, that unearned success is a curse. It
      is the rule of Providence, that the process of earning
      success, shall be the preparation for its conservation and

      13. So, day by day, and week by week; so, month after month,
      and year after year, <i>work on</i>, and in that process gain
      strength and symmetry, and nerve and knowledge, that when
      success, patiently and bravely worked for, shall come, it may
      find you prepared to receive it and keep it. The development
      which you will get in this brave and patient labor, will
      prove itself, in the end, the most valuable of your
      successes. It will help to make a <i>man</i> of you. It will
      give you power and self-reliance. It will give you not only
      <i>self-respect</i>, but the <i>respect of your fellows and
      the public</i>.

      THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      ROLLIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The young people of Athens, amazed at the glory of
      Themistocles,[Headnote 1] of Cimon,[Headnote 2] of
      Pericles,[Headnote 3] and full of a foolish ambition, after
      having received some lessons from the sophists, who promised
      to render them very great politicians, believed themselves
      capable of every thing, and aspired to fill the highest
      places. One of them, named Glaucon, took it so strongly in
      his head that he had a <i>peculiar genius</i> for public
      affairs, although he was not yet twenty years of age, that no
      person in his family, nor among his friends, had the power to
      divert him from a notion so little befitting his age and
      capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Socrates, who liked him on account of Plato[Headnote 4]
      his brother, was the only one who succeeded in making him
      change his resolution. Meeting him one day, he accosted him
      with so dexterous a discourse, that he induced him to listen.
      He had already gained much influence over him. "You have a
      desire to govern the republic?" said Socrates. "True,"
      replied Glaucon. "You can not have a finer design," said the
      philosopher, "since, if you succeed in it, you will be in a
      state to serve your friends, to enlarge your house, and to
      extend the limits of your native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. "You will become known not only in Athens, but through all
      Greece; and it may be that your renown will reach even to the
      barbarous nations, like that of Themistocles. At last, you
      will gain the respect and admiration of everybody." A
      beginning so flattering pleased the young man exceedingly,
      and he very willingly continued the conversation. "Since you
      desire to make yourself esteemed and respected, it is clear
      that you think to render yourself useful to the public."
      "Assuredly." "Tell me, then, I beseech you, what is the first
      service that you intend to render the state?"
    </p>
    <p>
      4. As Glaucon appeared to be perplexed, and considered what
      he ought to answer,&mdash;"Probably," replied Socrates, "it
      will be to enrich the republic, that is to say, to increase
      its revenues." "Exactly so." "And, undoubtedly, you know in
      what the revenues of the state consist, and the extent to
      which they may be increased. You will not have failed to make
      it a private study, to the end that if one source should
      suddenly fail, you may be able to supply its place
      immediately with another." "I assure you," answered Glaucon,
      "that this is what I have never thought of."
    </p>
    <p>
      5. "Tell me, at least, then, the necessary expenses of
      maintaining the republic. You can not fail to know of what
      importance it is to retrench those which are superfluous." "I
      confess to you that I am not more instructed with regard to
      this article than the other." "Then it is necessary to defer
      till another time the design that you have of enriching the
      republic; for it is impossible for you to benefit the state
      while you are ignorant of its revenues and expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. "But," said Glaucon, "there is still another means that
      you pass over in silence,&mdash;one can enrich a state by the
      ruin of its enemies." "You are right." replied Socrates,
      "but, in order to do that, you must be the more powerful;
      otherwise you run the risk of losing that which you possess.
      So, he who speaks of undertaking a war, ought to know the
      power of both parties, to the end that if he finds his party
      the stronger, he may boldly risk the adventure; but, if he
      find it the weaker, he should dissuade the people from
      undertaking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. "But, do you know what are the forces of our republic, by
      sea and by land, and what are those of our enemies'? have you
      a statement of them in writing'? You will do me the pleasure
      to allow me a perusal of it." "I have none yet," replied
      Glaucon. "I see, then," said Socrates, "that we shall not
      make war so soon, if they intrust <i>you</i> with the
      government; for there remain many things for you to know, and
      many cares to take."
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The sage mentioned many other articles, not less
      important, in which he found Glaucon equally inexperienced,
      and he pointed out how ridiculous they render themselves, who
      have the rashness to intermeddle with government, without
      bringing any other preparation to the task than <i>a great
      degree of self-esteem and excessive ambition</i>. "Fear, my
      dear Glaucon," said Socrates, "fear, lest a too ardent desire
      for honors should blind you; and cause you to take a part
      that would cover you with shame, in bringing to light your
      incapacity, and want of talent."
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The youth was wise enough to profit by the good advice of
      his instructor, and took some time to gain private
      information, before he ventured to appear in public. This
      lesson is for all ages.
    </p>

      aspire? 2. What did Glaucon believe he possessed? 3. Who
      succeeded in making him change his resolution? 4. How did

      SONG OF THE AMERICAN EAGLE.
    </h4>
    <pre>
1. I build my nest on the mountain's crest,
   Where the wild winds rock my eaglets to rest,&mdash;
   Where the lightnings flash, and the thunders crash,
   And the roaring torrents foam and dash;
   For my spirit free henceforth shall be
   A type of the sons of Liberty.
2. Aloft I fly from my a&euml;rie high,
   Through the vaulted dome of the azure sky;
   On a sunbeam bright take my airy flight,
   And float in a flood of liquid light;
   For I love to play in the noontide ray,
   And bask in a blaze from the throne of day.
3. Away I spring with a tireless wing,
   On a feathery cloud I poise and swing;
   I dart down the steep where the lightnings leap,
   And the clear blue canopy swiftly sweep;
   For, dear to me is the revelry
   Of a free and fearless Liberty.
4. I love the land where the mountains stand,
   Like the watch-towers high of a Patriot band;
   For I may not bide in my glory and pride,
   Though the land be never so fair and wide,
   Where Luxury reigns o'er voluptuous plains,
   And fetters the free-born soul in chains.
5. Then give to me in my flights to see
   The land of the pilgrims <i>ever free</i>!
   And I never will rove from the haunts I love
   But watch, from my sentinel-track above,
   Your banner free, o'er land and sea,
   And exult in your glorious Liberty.
6. <i>O, guard ye well the land where I dwell</i>,
   Lest to future times the tale I tell,
   When slow expires in smoldering fires
   The goodly heritage of your sires,&mdash;
   How Freedom's light rose clear and bright
   O'er fair Columbia's beacon-hight,
   Till ye quenched the flame in a starless night.
7. Then will I tear from your pennon fair
   The stars ye have set in triumph there;
   My olive-branch on the blast I'll launch,
   The fluttering stripes from the flagstaff wrench,
   And away I'll flee; for I scorn to see
<i>A craven race</i> in the land of the free!

      Now rising free and strong,
    And see yon mighty river roll
      Its sounding tide along!
11. Ah! yet near earth the eagle tires,
      Lost in the sea, the river;
<i>But naught can stay the human mind</i>,&mdash;
<i>'Tis upward, onward, ever!</i>

    And pause but at the farthest world
      In the universe of God.

      In mad, tyrannic pride,
    Cast fetters on the Hellespont,[Headnote 1]

      THE LAST CRUISE OF THE MONITOR.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      GREENVILLE M. WEEKS.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. On the afternoon of December 29th, 1862, she put on steam,
      and, in tow of the "Rhode Island," passed Fortress Monroe,
      and out to sea. As we gradually passed out, the wind
      freshened somewhat; but the sun went down in glorious clouds
      of purple and crimson, and the night was fair and calm above
      us, though, in the interior of our little vessel, the air had
      already begun to lose its freshness. We suffered more or less
      from its closeness through the night, and woke in the morning
      to find it heavy with impurity, from the breaths of some
      sixty persons, composing the officers and crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Sunshine found us on deck, enjoying pure air, and watching
      the east. During the night we had passed Cape Henry, and now,
      at dawn, found ourselves on the ocean,&mdash;the land only a
      blue line in the distance. A few more hours, and that had
      vanished. No sails were visible; and the Passaic, which we
      had noticed the evening before, was now out of sight. The
      morning and afternoon passed quietly; we spent most of our
      time on deck, on account of the confined air below, and,
      being on a level with the sea, with the spray dashing over us
      occasionally, amused ourselves with noting its shifting hues
      and forms, from the deep green of the first long roll, to the
      foam-crest and prismatic tints of the falling wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. As the afternoon advanced, the freshening wind, the
      thickening clouds, and the increasing roll of the sea, gave
      those most accustomed to ordinary ship-life, some new
      experiences. The little vessel plunged through the rising
      waves, instead of riding them, and, as they increased in
      violence, lay, as it were, under their crests, which washed
      over her continually; so that, even when we considered
      ourselves safe, the appearance was that of a vessel sinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. "I'd rather go to sea in a diving-bell!" said one, as the
      waves dashed over the pilot-house, and the little craft
      seemed buried in water. "Give me an oyster-scow!" cried
      another,&mdash;"any thing! only let it be <i>wood</i>, and
      something that will float <i>over</i>, instead of
      <i>under</i> the water!" Still she plunged on; and about 6:30
      P.M., we made Cape Hatteras; in half an hour we had rounded
      the point. A general hurrah went up,&mdash;"Hurrah for the
      first iron-clad that ever rounded Cape Hatteras! Hurrah for
      the little boat that is first in every thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      5. At half-past seven, a heavy shower fell, lasting about
      twenty minutes. At this time the gale increased; black, heavy
      clouds covered the sky, through which the moon glittered
      fitfully, allowing us to see in the distance a long line of
      white, plunging foam rushing toward us,&mdash;sure
      indication, to a sailor's eye, of a stormy time. A gloom
      overhung every thing; the banks of cloud seemed to settle
      around us; the moan of the ocean grew louder and more
      fearful. Still our little boat pushed doggedly on: victorious
      through all, we thought that here, too, she would conquer,
      though the beating waves sent shudders through her whole
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. An hour passed; the air below, which had all day been
      increasing in closeness, was now almost stifling; but our men
      lost no courage. Some sang as they worked; and the cadence of
      their voices, mingling with the roar of waters, sounded like
      a defiance to Ocean. Some stationed themselves on top of the
      turret, and a general enthusiasm filled all breasts, as huge
      waves, twenty feet high, rose up on all sides, hung suspended
      for a moment like jaws open to devour, and then, breaking,
      gnashed over in foam from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Those of us new to the sea, and not apprehending our
      peril, hurrahed for the largest wave; but the captain and one
      or two others, old sailors, knowing its power, grew
      momentarily more and more&mdash;anxious, feeling, with a
      dread instinctive to the sailor, that, in case of extremity,
      no wreck yet known to ocean, could be so hopeless as this.
      Solid iron from keelson to turret-top, clinging to any thing
      for safety, if the "Monitor" should go down, would only
      insure a share in her fate. No mast., no spar, no floating
      thing, to meet the outstretched hand in the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The sea gathered force from each attack. Thick and fast
      came the blows on the iron mail of the "Monitor," and still
      the brave little vessel held her own, until, at half-past
      eight, the engineer, faithful to the end, reported a leak.
      The pumps were instantly set in motion, and we watched their
      progress with an intense interest. She had seemed to us like
      an old-time knight, in armor, battling against fearful odds,
      but still holding his ground. We who watched, when the blow
      came which made the strong man reel and the life-blood spout,
      felt our hearts faint within us; then, again, ground was
      gained, and the fight went on, the water lowering somewhat
      under the laboring pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. From nine to ten it kept pace with them. From ten to
      eleven the sea increased in violence, the waves now dashing
      entirely over the turret, blinding the eyes, and causing
      quick catchings of the breath, as they swept against us. At
      ten the engineer had reported the leak as gaining on us; at
      half-past ten, with several pumps in constant motion, one of
      which threw out three thousand gallons a minute, the water
      was rising rapidly, and nearing the fires. When these were
      reached, the vessel's doom was sealed; for, with their
      extinction, the pumps must cease, and all hope of keeping the
      "Monitor" above water more than an hour or two, expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Our knight had received his death-blow, and lay
      struggling and helpless under the power of a stronger than
      he. A consultation was held, and, not without a conflict of
      fueling, it was decided that signals of distress should be
      made. Ocean claimed our little vessel, and her trembling
      frame and failing fire proved she would soon answer his call;
      yet a pang went through us, as we thought of the first
      iron-clad lying alone at the bottom of this stormy sea, her
      guns silenced, herself a useless mass of metal. Each quiver
      of her strong frame seemed to plead with us not to abandon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The work she <i>had</i> done, the work she <i>was</i> to
      do, rose before us: might there not be a possibility of
      saving her yet? Her time could not have come so soon. But we
      who descended for a moment to the cabin, knew, by the
      rising-water through which we waded, that the end was near.
      Small time was there for regrets. Rockets were thrown up, and
      answered by the "Rhode Island," whose brave men prepared at
      once to lower boats, though, in that wild sea, it was almost
      madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. The "Monitor" had been attached to the "Rhode Island" by
      two hawsers, one of which had parted at about seven P.M. The
      other remained firm; but now it was necessary it should be
      cut. How was that possible, when every wave washed clean over
      the deck? What man could reach it alive? "Who'll cut the
      hawser?" shouted Captain Bankhead. Acting master Stodder
      volunteered, and was followed by another. Holding by one hand
      to the ropes at her side, they cut through, by many blows of
      the hatchet, the immense rope which united the vessels.
      Stodder returned in safety, but his brave companion was
      washed over, and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Meanwhile the boat launched from the "Rhode Island," had
      started, manned by a crew of picked men. A mere heroic
      impulse could not have accomplished this most noble deed. For
      hours they had watched the raging sea. Their captain and
      <i>they</i> knew the danger; every man who entered that boat,
      did it at the peril of his life; and yet all were ready. Are
      not such acts as these convincing proofs of the divinity of
      human nature'? We watched her with straining eyes; for few
      thought she could live to reach us. She neared; we were sure
      of her, thank Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      14. In this interval, the cut hawser had become entangled in
      the paddle-wheel of the "Rhode Island," and she drifted down
      upon us; we, not knowing this fact, supposed her coming to
      our assistance; but a moment undeceived us. The launch sent
      to our relief was now between us and her,&mdash;too near for
      safety. The steamer bore swiftly down, stern first, upon our
      starboard quarter. "<i>Keep off! keep off!</i>" we cried, and
      then first saw she was helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Even as we looked, the devoted boat was caught between
      the steamer and the iron-clad,&mdash;a sharp sound of
      crushing wood was heard,&mdash;thwarts, oars, and splinters
      flew in air,&mdash;the boat's crew leaped to the "Monitor's"
      deck, Death stared us in the face; our iron prow must go
      through the Rhode Island's side,&mdash;and then an end to
      all. One awful moment we held our breath,&mdash;then the
      hawser was cleared,&mdash;the steamer moved off, as it were,
      step by step, first one, then another, till a ship's length
      lay between us, and then we breathed freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. But the boat!&mdash;had she gone to the bottom, carrying
      brave souls with her? No; there she lay, beating against our
      iron sides; but still, though bruised and broken, a lifeboat
      to us. There was no hasty scramble for life when it was found
      she floated,&mdash;all held back. The men kept steady on at
      their work of bailing,&mdash;only those leaving, and in the
      order named, whom the captain bade save themselves. They
      descended from the turret to the deck with mingled fear and
      hope, for the waves tore from side to side, and the coolest
      head and bravest heart could not guaranty safety. Some were
      washed over as they left the turret, and, with a vain clutch
      at the iron deck, a wild throwing up of the arms, went down,
      their death-cry ringing in the ears of their companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. The boat sometimes held her place by the "Monitor's"
      side, then was dashed hopelessly out of reach, rising and
      falling on the waves. A sailor would spring from the deck to
      reach her, to be seen for a moment in mid-air, and then, as
      she rose, fall into her. So she gradually filled up; but some
      poor souls who sought to reach her, failed, even as they
      touched her receding sides, and went down. We had a little
      messenger-boy, the special charge of one of our sailors, and
      the pet of all; he must inevitably have been lost, but for
      the care of his adopted father, who, holding him firmly in
      his arms, escaped, as by a miracle, being washed overboard,
      but finally succeeded in placing him safely in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. The last but one to make the desperate venture, was the
      surgeon; he leaped from the deck, at the very instant when
      the boat was being swept away by the merciless sea. Making
      one final effort, he threw his body forward as he fell,
      striking across the boat's side so violently, it was thought
      some of his ribs must be broken. "<i>Haul the Doctor in!</i>"
      shouted Lieutenant Greene, perhaps remembering how, a little
      time back, he himself, almost gone down in the unknown sea,
      had been "hauled in" by a quinine rope flung him by the
      Doctor. Stout sailor-arms pulled him in; one more sprang to a
      place in her, and the boat, now full, pushed off,&mdash;in a
      sinking condition, it is true, but still bearing hope with
      her, for <i>she was wood</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Over the waves we made little progress, though pulling
      for life. The men stuffed their pea-jackets into the leaks,
      and bailed incessantly. We neared the "Rhode Island;" but now
      a new peril appeared. Eight down upon our center, borne by
      the might of the rushing water, came the whale-boat sent to
      rescue others from the iron-clad. We barely floated; if she
      struck us with her bows full on us, we must go to the bottom.
      One sprang, and, as she neared, with outstretched arms, met
      and turned her course. She passed against us, and his hand,
      caught between the two boats, was crushed, and the arm,
      wrenched from its socket, fell a helpless weight against his
      side; but life remained. We were saved, and an arm was a
      small price to pay for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. We reached the "Rhode Island;" ropes were flung over her
      side, and caught with a death-grip. Some lost their hold,
      were washed away, and again dragged in by the boat's crew.
      What chance had one whose right arm hung a dead weight, when
      strong men with their two hands, went down before him? He
      caught at a rope, found it impossible to save himself alone,
      and then for the first time said,&mdash;"I am injured; can
      any one help me?" Ensign Taylor, at the risk of his own life,
      brought the rope around his shoulder in such a way that it
      could not slip, and he was drawn up in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. In the mean time, the whale-boat, which had nearly caused
      our destruction, had reached the side of the "Monitor;" and
      now the captain said, "It is madness to remain here longer:
      let each man save himself." For a moment, he descended to the
      cabin for a coat, and his faithful servant followed to secure
      a jewel-box, containing the accumulated treasure of years. A
      sad, sorry sight it was! In the heavy air the lamps burned
      dimly, and the water, waist-deep, splashed sullenly against
      the sides of the wardroom. One lingering look, and he left
      the "Monitor's" cabin forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      22. Time was precious; he hastened to the deck, where, in the
      midst of a terrible sea, Lieutenant Greene nobly held his
      post. He seized the rope from the whale-boat, wound it about
      an iron stanchion, then around his wrists, and, by this
      means, was drawn aboard the boat. Thus, one by one, watching
      their time between the waves, the men filled in, and, at
      last, after making all effort for others, and none for
      themselves, Captain Bankhead and Lieutenant Greene took their
      places in the boat The gallant Brown pushed off, and soon
      laid his boat-load safe upon the "Rhode Island's" deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      23. Here the heartiest and most tender reception met us. Our
      drenched clothing was replaced by warm and dry garments, and
      all on board vied with each other in acts of kindness. The
      only one who had received any injury, Surgeon Weeks,
      [Footnote: The writer of this account.] was carefully
      attended to, the dislocated arm set, and the crushed fingers
      amputated, by the gentlest and most considerate of surgeons,
      Dr. Webber, of the "Rhode Island."
    </p>
    <p>
      24. For an hour or more we watched, from the deck of the
      steamer, the lonely light upon the "Monitor's" turrets; a
      hundred times we thought it gone forever,&mdash;a hundred
      times it reappeared, till, at last, about two o'clock,
      Wednesday morning, December 31st, it sank, and we saw it no
      more. An actor in the scenes of that wild night, when the
      "Monitor" went down, relates the story of her last cruise.
      <i>Her</i> work is now over. She lies a hundred fathoms deep
      under the stormy-waters off Cape Hatteras; but she has made
      herself a name, which will not soon be forgotten by the
      American people.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. When and where was the Monitor lost? 2.
      What signal service had she rendered? 3. Who was the writer
      of this account?

    <h4>
      DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF WOMAN.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      GAIL HAMILTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Oh, if this latent power could be aroused! If woman would
      shake off this slumber, and put on her strength, her
      beautiful garments, how would she go forth conquering and to
      conquer! How would the mountains break forth into singing,
      and the trees of the field clap their hands! How would our
      sin-stained earth arise and shine, her light being come, and
      the glory of the Lord being risen upon her!
    </p>
    <p>
      2. One can not do the <i>world's</i> work; but one can do
      <i>one's</i> work. You may not be able to turn the world from
      iniquity; but you can, at least, keep the dust and rust from
      gathering on your own soul. If you can not be directly and
      actively engaged in fighting the battle, you can, at least,
      polish your armor and sharpen your weapons, to strike an
      effective blow when the hour comes. You can stanch the blood
      of him who has been wounded in the fray,&mdash;bear a cup of
      cold water to the thirsty and fainting,&mdash;give help to
      the conquered, and smiles to the victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. You can gather from the past and the present stores of
      wisdom, so that, when the future demands it, you may bring
      forth from your treasures things new and old. Whatever of
      bliss the "Divinity that shapes our ends" may see fit to
      withhold from you, you are but very little lower than the
      angels, so long as you have the
    </p>
    <pre>
  "Godlike power to do,&mdash;the godlike aim to know."
</pre>
    <p>
      4. You can be forming habits of self-reliance, sound
      judgment, perseverance, and endurance, which may, one day,
      stand you in good stead. You can so train yourself to right
      thinking and right acting, that uprightness shall be your
      nature, truth your impulse. His head is seldom far wrong,
      whose heart is always right. We bow down to mental greatness,
      intellectual strength, and they are divine gifts; but
      <i>moral rectitude</i> is stronger than they. It is
      irresistible,&mdash;always in the end triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. There is in <i>goodness</i> a penetrative power that
      nothing can withstand. Cunning and malice melt away before
      its mild, open, steady glance. Not alone on the fields where
      chivalry charges for laurels, with helmet and breastplate and
      lance in rest, can the true knight exultingly exclaim,
    </p>
    <pre>
"My strength is as the strength of ten,
  Because my heart is pure;"
</pre>
    <p>
      <br>
       but wherever man meets man, wherever there is a prize to be
      won, a goal to be reached. Wealth, and rank, and beauty, may
      form a brilliant setting to the diamond; but they only expose
      more nakedly the false glare of the paste. Only when the
      king's daughter is all glorious within, is it fitting and
      proper that her clothing should be of wrought gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. From the great and good of all ages rings out the same
      monotone. The high-priest of Nature, the calm-eyed poet who
      laid his heart so close to hers, that they seemed to throb in
      one pulsation, yet whose ear was always open to the "still
      sad music of humanity," has given us the promise of his
      life-long wisdom in these grand words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <pre>
"True dignity abides with him alone
 Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,
 Can still suspect and still revere himself."
</pre>
    <p>
      7. Through the din of twenty rolling centuries, pierces the
      sharp, stern voice of the brave old Greek: "<i>Let every man,
      when he is about to do a wicked action, above all things in
      the world, stand in awe of himself, and dread the witness
      within him.</i>" All greatness, and all glory, all that earth
      has to give, all that Heaven can proffer, lies within the
      reach of the lowliest as well as the highest; for He who
      spake as never man spake, has said that the very "kingdom of
      God is within you."
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Born to such an inheritance, will you wantonly cast it
      away? With such a goal in prospect, will you suffer yourself
      to be turned aside by the sheen and shimmer of tinsel fruit?
      With earth in possession, and Heaven in reversion, will you
      go sorrowing and downcast, because here and there a pearl or
      ruby fails you? Nay, rather forgetting those things which are
      behind, and reaching forth unto those which are before,
      <i>press forward</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Discontent and murmuring are insidious foes; trample them
      under your feet. Utter no complaint, whatever betide; for
      complaining is a sign of weakness. If your trouble can be
      helped, <i>help it</i>; if not, <i>bear it</i>. You can be
      whatever you <i>will</i> to be. Therefore, form and
      accomplish worthy purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. If you walk alone, let it be with no faltering tread.
      Show to an incredulous world
    </p>
    <pre>
"How grand may be Life's might,
 Without Love's circling crown."
</pre>
    <p>
      <br>
       Or, if the golden thread of love shine athwart the dusky
      warp of duty, if other hearts depend on yours for sustenance
      and strength, give to them from your fullness no stinted
      measure. Let the dew of your kindness fall on the evil and
      the good, on the just and on the unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Compass happiness, since happiness alone is victory. On
      the fragments of your shattered plans, and hopes, and
      love,&mdash;on the heaped-up ruins of your past, rear a
      stately palace, whose top shall reach unto heaven, whose
      beauty shall gladden the eyes of all beholders, whose doors
      shall stand wide open to receive the way-worn and weary. Life
      is a burden, but it is imposed by God. What you <i>make</i>
      of it, it will <i>be</i> to you, whether a millstone about
      your neck, or a diadem upon your brow. <i>Take it up bravely,
      bear it on joyfully, lay it down triumphantly.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What are some of the duties of women? 2.
      What is said of goodness? 3. What was the adage of the old

    <p>

      <i>Stran</i>. To save himself and child from certain
      death,<br>

       Upon the stripling's head.

       Launch down thy vengeance by a mother's hand.<br>

      <i>Stran</i>. Something's on foot! 'Twas only yesterday,<br>
       That, traveling from our canton, I espied<br>
       Slow toiling up a steep, a mountaineer<br>
       Of brawny limb, upon his back a load<br>
       Of fagots bound. Curious to see what end<br>
       Was worthy of such labor, after him<br>
       I took the cliff; and saw its lofty top<br>
       Receive his load, which went but to augment<br>
       A pile of many another.

1. So goes the world`;&mdash;if wealthy, you may call
<i>This</i>&mdash;friend, <i>that</i>&mdash;brother`;&mdash;friends and brothers all
     Though you are worthless, witless,&mdash;never mind it;
   You may have been a stable-boy,&mdash;what then?
   'Tis <i>wealth</i>, my friends, makes <i>honorable</i> men.
     You seek respect, no doubt, and you will find it.
2. But, if you are poor', heaven help you`! though your sire
   Had royal blood in him`, and though you
   Possess the intellect of angels too.
   'Tis all in vain`;&mdash;the world will ne'er inquire
   On such a score`:&mdash;why should it take the pains?
  'Tis easier to weigh purses`, sure, than brains'.
3. I once saw a poor fellow, keen and clever.
   Witty and wise`; he paid a man a visit,
   And no one noticed him', and no one ever
   Gave him a welcome`. "Strange`," cried I', "whence is it`?"
       He walked on this side', then on that`,
       He tried to introduce a social chat`;
   Now here', now there`, in vain he tried`;
   Some formally and freezingly replied,
   And some said by their silence,&mdash;"Better stay at home."
4.     A rich man burst the door,
       As Croesus[Headnote 1] rich;&mdash;I'm sure
   He could not pride himself upon his wit`;
   And, as for wisdom, he had none of it`;
   He had what's better`,&mdash;he had wealth.
       What a confusion!&mdash;all stand up erect,&mdash;
   These crowd around to ask him of his health;
       These bow in <i>honest</i> duty and respect;
   And these arrange a sofa or a chair,
   And these conduct him there.
   "Allow me, sir, the honor`;"&mdash;Then a bow
   Down to the earth`.&mdash;<i>Is't</i> possible to show
   Meet gratitude for such kind condescension`!
5.     The poor man hung his head,
       And to himself he said,
   "This is indeed beyond my comprehension:"
   Then looking round, one friendly face he found,
   And said,&mdash;"Pray tell me why is wealth preferred
   "To wisdom?"&mdash;"That's a silly question, friend!"
   Replied the other,&mdash;"have you never heard.
       A man may lend his store
       Of gold or silver ore,

    </p>
    <h4>
      GRANDEUR OF THE OCEAN.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      WALTER COLTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The most fearful and impressive exhibitions of power known
      to our globe, belong to the ocean. The volcano, with its
      ascending flame and falling torrents of fire, and the
      earthquake, whose footstep is on the ruin of cities, are
      circumscribed in the desolating range of their visitations.
      But the ocean, when it once rouses itself in its chainless
      strength, shakes a thousand shores with its storm and
      thunder. Navies of oak and iron are tossed in mockery from
      its crest, and armaments, manned by the strength and courage
      of millions, perish among its bubbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The avalanche, shaken from its glittering steep, if it
      rolls to the bosom of the earth, melts away, and is lost in
      vapor; but if it plunge into the embrace of the ocean, this
      mountain mass of ice and hail is borne about for ages in
      tumult and terror; it is the drifting monument of the ocean's
      dead. The tempest on land is impeded by forests, and broken
      by mountains; but on the plain of the deep it rushes
      unresisted; and when its strength is at last spent, ten
      thousand giant waves still roll its terrors onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The mountain lake and the meadow stream are inhabited only
      by the timid prey of the angler; but the ocean is the home of
      the leviathan,&mdash;his ways are in the mighty deep. The
      glittering pebble and the rainbow-tinted shell, which the
      returning tide has left on the shore, and the watery gem
      which the pearl-diver reaches at the peril of his life, are
      all that man can filch from the treasures of the sea. The
      groves of coral which wave over its pavements, and the halls
      of amber which glow in its depths, are beyond his approaches,
      save when he goes down there to seek, amid their silent
      magnificence, his burial monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The islands, the continents, the shores of civilized and
      savage realms, the capitals of kings, are worn by time,
      washed away by the wave, consumed by the flame, or sunk by
      the earthquake; but the ocean still remains, and still rolls
      on in the greatness of its unabated strength. Over the
      majesty of its form and the marvel of its might, time and
      disaster have no power. Such as creation's dawn beheld, it
      rolleth now.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The vast clouds of vapor which roll up from its bosom,
      float away to encircle the globe: on distant mountains and
      deserts they pour out their watery treasures, which gather
      themselves again in streams and torrents, to return, with
      exulting bounds, to their parent ocean. These are the
      messengers which proclaim in every land the exhaustless
      resources of the sea; but it is reserved for those who go
      down in ships, and who do business in the great waters, to
      see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Let one go upon deck in the middle watch of a still night,
      with naught above him but the silent and solemn skies, and
      naught around and beneath him but an interminable waste of
      waters, and with the conviction that there is but a plank
      between him and eternity, a feeling of loneliness, solitude,
      and desertion, mingled with a sentiment of reverence for the
      vast, mysterious and unknown, will come upon him with a
      power, all unknown before, and he might stand for hours
      entranced in reverence and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Man, also, has made the ocean the theater of <i>his</i>
      power. The ship in which he rides that element, is one of the
      highest triumphs of his skill. At first, this floating fabric
      was only a frail bark, slowly urged by the laboring oar. The
      sail, at length, arose and spread its wings to the wind.
      Still he had no power to direct his course when the lofty
      promontory sunk from sight, or the orbs above him were lost
      in clouds. But the secret of the magnet is, at length,
      revealed to him, and his needle now settles, with a fixedness
      which love has stolen as the symbol of its constancy, to the
      polar star.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Now, however, he can dispense even with sail, and wind,
      and flowing wave. He constructs and propels his vast engines
      of flame and vapor, and, through the solitude of the sea, as
      over the solid land, goes thundering on his track. On the
      ocean, too, thrones have been lost and won. On the fate of
      Actium[Headnote 1] was suspended the empire of the world. In
      the gulf of Salamis,[Headnote 2] the pride of Persia found a
      grave; and the crescent set forever in the waters of
      Navarino;[Headnote 3] while, at Trafalgar[Headnote 4] and the
      Nile, nations held their breath,
    </p>
    <pre>
      As each gun,
From its adamantine lips,
Spread a death-shade round the ships
Like the hurricane's eclipse
      Of the sun.
</pre>
    <p>
      9. But, of all the wonders appertaining to the ocean, the
      greatest, perhaps, is its transforming power on man. It
      unravels and weaves anew the web of his moral and social
      being. It invests him with feelings, associations, and
      habits, to which he has been an entire stranger. It breaks up
      the sealed fountain of his nature, and lifts his soul into
      features prominent as the cliffs which beetle over its surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Once the adopted child of the ocean, he can never bring
      back his entire sympathies to land. He will still move in his
      dreams over that vast waste of waters, still bound in
      exultation and triumph through its foaming billows. All the
      other realities of life will be comparatively tame, and he
      will sigh for his tossing element, as the caged eagle for the
      roar and arrowy light of his mountain cataract.

    <h4>
      A BURIAL AT SEA.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      WALTER COLTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Death is a fearful thing, come in what form it
      may,&mdash;fearful, when the vital chords are so gradually
      relaxed, that life passes away sweetly as music from the
      slumbering harp-string,&mdash;fearful, when in his own quiet
      chamber, the departing one is summoned by those who sweetly
      follow him with their prayers, when the assiduities of
      friendship and affection can go no farther, and who discourse
      of heaven and future blessedness, till the closing ear can no
      longer catch the tones of the long-familiar voice, and who,
      lingering near, still feel for the hushed pulse, and then
      trace in the placid slumber, which pervades each feature, a
      quiet emblem of the spirit's serene repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. What, then, must this dread event be to one, who meets it
      comparatively alone, far away from the hearth of his home,
      upon a troubled sea, between the narrow decks of a restless
      ship, and at that dread hour of night, when even the
      sympathies of the world seem suspended! Such has been the end
      of many who traverse the ocean; and such was the hurried end
      of him, whose remains we have just consigned to a watery
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He was a sailor; but, beneath his rude exterior, he
      carried a heart touched with refinement, pride, and
      greatness. There was something about him, which spoke of
      better days and a higher destiny. By what errors or
      misfortunes he was reduced to his humble condition, was a
      secret which he would reveal to none. Silent, reserved, and
      thoughtful, he stood a stranger among his free companions,
      and never was his voice heard in the laughter or the jest. He
      has undoubtedly left behind many who will long look for his
      return, and bitterly weep when they are told they shall see
      his face no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. As the remains of the poor sailor were brought up on deck,
      wound in that hammock which, through many a stormy night, had
      swung to the wind, one could not but observe the big tear
      that stole unconsciously down the rough cheeks of his hardy
      companions. When the funeral service was read to that most
      affecting passage, "we commit this body to the deep," and the
      plank was raised which precipitated to the momentary eddy of
      the wave the quickly disappearing form, a heavy sigh from
      those around, told that the strong heart of the sailor can be
      touched with grief, and that a truly unaffected sorrow may
      accompany virtue, in its most unpretending form, to its ocean
      grave. Yet how soon is such a scene forgotten!
    </p>
    <pre>
"As from the wing the sky no scar retains,
 The parted wave no furrow from the keel,
 So dies in human hearts the thought of death."
</pre>
    <p>
      5. There is something peculiarly melancholy and impressive in
      a burial at sea: there is here no coffin or hearse,
      procession or tolling bell,&mdash;nothing that gradually
      prepares us for the final separation. The body is wound in
      the drapery of its couch, much as if the deceased were only
      in a quiet and temporary sleep. In these habiliments of
      seeming slumber, it is dropped into the wave, the waters
      close over it, the vessel passes quickly on, and not a
      solitary trace is left to tell where sunk from light and
      life, one that loved to look at the sky and breathe this
      vital air.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is nothing that, for one moment, can point to the
      deep, unvisited resting-place of the departed,&mdash;it is a
      grave in the midst of the ocean,&mdash;in the midst of a
      vast, untrodden solitude. Affection can not approach it, with
      its tears; the dews of heaven can not reach it; and there is
      around it no violet, or shrub, or murmuring stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. It may be superstitious; but no advantages of wealth, or
      honor, or power, through life, would reconcile me at its
      close to such a burial. I would rather share the coarse and
      scanty provisions of the simplest cabin, and drop away
      unknown and unhonored by the world, so that my final
      resting-place be beneath some green tree, by the side of some
      living stream, or in some familiar spot, where the few that
      loved me in life, might visit me in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. But, whether our grave be in the fragrant shade, or in the
      fathomless ocean, among our kindred, or in the midst of
      strangers, the day is coming when we shall all appear at one
      universal bar, and receive from a righteous Judge the award
      of our deeds. He that is wisest, penetrates the future the
      deepest.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What is said of death? 2. What, of death
      at sea? 3. What renders a burial at sea peculiarly melancholy
      and impressive?

1. What hid'st thou in thy treasure-caves and cells?
     Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main!
   Pale, glistening pearls, and rainbow-colored shells,
     Bright things which gleam unrecked of, and in vain!
   Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy sea!
         We ask not such from thee.
2. Yet more, the depths have more! what wealth untold,
     Far down, and shining through their stillness lies!
   Thou hast the starry gems, the burning gold,
     Won from ten thousand royal argosies!
   Sweep o'er thy spoils, thou wild and wrathful main!
         Earth claims not <i>these</i> again.
3. Yet more, the depths have more! thy waves have rolled
     Above the cities of a world gone by!
   Sand hath filled up the palaces of old,
     Sea-weed o'ergrown the halls of revelry.
   Dash o'er them, Ocean! in thy scornful play!
         Man yields them to decay.
4. Yet more, the billows and the depths have more!
     High hearts and brave are gathered to thy breast!
   They hear not now the booming waters roar;
     The battle-thunders will not break their rest.
   Keep thy red gold and gems, thou stormy grave!
       Give back the true and brave!
5. Give back the lost and lovely,&mdash;those for whom
     The place was kept at board and hearth so long,
   The prayer went up through midnight's breathless gloom,
     And the vain yearning woke 'midst festal song!
   Hold fast thy buried isles, thy towers o'erthrown;
         But all is not thine own.
6. To thee the love of woman hath gone down;
     Dark flow thy tides o'er manhood's noble head,
   O'er youth's bright locks, and beauty's flowery crown,
     Yet must thou hear a voice,&mdash;<i>Restore the dead!</i>
   Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee!
<i>Restore the dead, thou Sea!</i>

      THOMAS HOOD.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. One more Unfortunate,
      Weary of breath,
    Rashly importunate,
      Gone to her death!
 2. Take her up tenderly,
      Lift her with care,
    Fashioned so slenderly,
      Young, and so fair!
 3. Look at her garments
    Clinging like cerements;
    While the wave constantly
      Drips from her clothing;
    Take her up instantly,
      Loving, not loathing.
 4. Touch her not scornfully;
    Think of her mournfully,
      Gently and humanly;
    Not of the stains of her;
    All that remains of her
      Now, is pure womanly.
 5. Make no deep scrutiny
    Into her mutiny,
      Rash and undutiful;
    Past all dishonor,
    Death has left on her
      Only the beautiful.
 6. Loop up her tresses
      Escaped from the comb,&mdash;
    Her fair auburn tresses;
    While wonderment guesses
      Where was her home?
 7. Who was her father`?
      Who was her mother`?
    Had she a sister'?
      Had she a brother'?
    Or, was there a dearer one
    Still, and a nearer one
      Yet, than all other'?
 8. Alas! for the rarity
    Of Christian charity
      Under the sun!
    Oh! it was pitiful!
    Near a whole city full,
      Home she had none.
 9. Sisterly, brotherly,
    Fatherly, motherly,
      Feelings had changed:
    Love, by harsh evidence,
    Thrown from its eminence;
    Even God's providence
      Seeming estranged.
10. Where the lamps quiver
    So far in the river,
      With many a light
    From window and casement,
    From garret to basement,
    She stood with amazement,
      Houseless by night.
11. The bleak winds of March
      Made her tremble and shiver
    But not the dark arch,
      Or the black flowing river,
    Mad from life's history,
    Glad to death's mystery,
      Swift to be hurled&mdash;
    Anywhere, anywhere,
      Out of the world!
12. In she plunged boldly,
    No matter how coldly
      The rough river ran&mdash;
    Picture it&mdash;think of it,
      Dissolute Man!
13. Take her up tenderly,
      Lift her with care,
    Fashioned so slenderly,
      Young, and so fair!
14. Perishing gloomily,
    Spurred by contumely,
    Cold inhumanity,
    Burning insanity,
      Into her rest,
    Cross her hands humbly,
    As if praying dumbly,
      Over her breast!
15. Owning her weakness,
      Her evil behavior,
    And leaving, with meekness,
      Her sins to her Savior!

    <h4>
      VISIT TO MOUNT VERNON.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      A.C. RITCHIE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. At this moment, we drew near the rude wharf at Mount
      Vernon; the boat stopped, and the crowd of passengers landed.
      By a narrow pathway we ascended a majestic hill thickly
      draped with trees. The sun scarcely found its way through the
      luxuriant foliage. We mounted slowly, but had only spent a
      few minutes in ascending, when we came suddenly upon a
      picturesque nook, where a cluster of unostentatious, white
      marble shafts, shot from the greenly sodded earth, inclosed
      by iron railings. Those unpretending monuments mark the
      localities where repose the mortal remains of Washington's
      kindred.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Just beyond stands a square brick building. In the center
      you see an iron gate. Here the crowd pauses in reverential
      silence. Men lift their hats and women bow their heads. You
      behold within, two sarcophagi.[Headnote 1] In those moldering
      tombs lie the ashes of the great Washington and his wife. Not
      a word is uttered as the crowd stand gazing on this lowly
      receptacle of the dust of America's mighty dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Are there any in that group who can say, "this was
      <i>our</i> country's father'?" If there be, can they stand
      pilgrims at that grave without Washington's examples, his
      counsels, his words, heretofore, it may be, half-forgotten,
      stealing back into their minds, until the sense of reverence
      and gratitude is deepened almost to awe? Do they not feel
      that Washington's spirit is abroad in the world, filling the
      souls of a heaven-favored people with the love of freedom and
      of country, though his ashes are gathered here'?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Some one moves to pass on; and, with that first step, the
      spell is broken; others follow. Herman and Jessie linger
      last. After a period of mute and moving reflection, they turn
      away and slowly approach the mansion that, in simple, rural
      stateliness, stands upon a noble promontory, belted with
      woods, and half-girdled by the sparkling waters of the
      Potomac, which flow in a semicircle around a portion of the
      mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The water and woodland view from the portico is highly
      imposing. But it was not the mere recognition of the
      picturesque and beautiful in nature, that moved Herman and
      Jessie. They would have felt that they were on holy ground,
      had the landscape been devoid of natural charm. Here the feet
      of the first of heroes had trod, and here, in boyhood, he had
      sported with his beloved brother Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. In those forests, those deep-wooded glens, he had hunted,
      when a stripling, by the side of old Lord Fairfax; here he
      took his first lessons in the art of war; to this home he
      brought his bride; by this old-fashioned, hospitable-looking
      fireside, he sat with that dear and faithful wife; beneath
      yonder alley of lofty trees he has often wandered by her
      side; here he indulged the agricultural tastes in which he
      delighted; here resigned his Cincinnatus vocation, and bade
      adieu to his cherished home at the summons of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Here his wife received the letter which told her that he
      had been appointed Commander-in-chief of the army; here, when
      the glorious struggle closed at the trumpet notes of
      victory&mdash;when the British had retired&mdash;when, with
      tears coursing down his benignant, manly countenance, he had
      uttered a touching farewell&mdash;bestowed a paternal
      benediction on the American army, and resigned all public
      service&mdash; <i>here</i> he returned, thinking to resume
      the rural pursuits that charmed him, and to end his days in
      peace!
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Here are the trees, the shrubbery he planted with his own
      hands, and noted in his diary; here are the columns of the
      portico round which he twined the coral honeysuckle; the ivy
      he transplanted still clings to yonder garden wall; these
      vistas he opened through yon pine groves to command far-off
      views! Here the valiant Lafayette sojourned with him; there
      hangs the key of the Bastile[Headnote 2] which he presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Here flocked the illustrious men of all climes, and were
      received with warm, unpretending, almost rustic hospitality.
      Here the French Houdon modeled his statue, and the English
      Pine painted his portrait, and caused that jocose remark, "I
      am so hackneyed to the touches of the painters' pencil, that
      I am altogether at their beck, and sit like 'Patience on a
      monument!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Then came another summons from the land he had saved, and
      he was chosen by unanimous voice its chief ruler. Thousands
      of men, women, and children, sent up acclamations, and called
      down blessings on his head, as he made his triumphal progress
      from Mount Vernon to New York, to take the presidential oath.
      The roar of cannon rent the air. The streets through which he
      passed, were illuminated and decked with flags and wreaths.
      Bonfires blazed on the hills. From ships and boats floated
      festive decorations. At Gray's Ferry, he passed under
      triumphal arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. On the bridge across the Assumpink, at Trenton, (the very
      bridge over which he had retreated in such blank despair,
      before the army of Cornwallis, on the eve of the battle of
      Princeton,) thirteen pillars, twined with laurel and
      evergreens, were reared by woman's hands. The foremost of the
      arches those columns supported, bore the inscription, <i>"The
      Defender of the Mothers will he the Protector of the
      Daughters."</i> Mothers, with their white-robed daughters,
      were assembled beneath the vernal arcade. Thirteen maidens
      scattered flowers beneath his feet, as they sang an ode of
      gratulation. The people's hero ever after spoke of this
      tribute, as the one that touched him most deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. When his first presidential term expired, and his heart
      yearned for the peace of his domestic hearth, the entreaties
      of Jefferson, Randolph, and Hamilton, forced him to forget
      that home for the one he held in the hearts of patriots, and
      to allow his name to be used a second time. A second time he
      was unanimously elected to preside over his country's
      welfare. But, the period happily expired, he thankfully laid
      aside the mantle of state, the scepter of power, and, five
      days after the inauguration of Adams, returned here to his
      Mount Vernon home. And here the good servant, whom his Lord,
      when He came, found watching and ready, calmly yielded up his
      breath, exclaiming, "It is well!" and his spirit was wafted
      to Heaven by the blessings of his enfranchised countrymen.

    <p class="rauth">
      CHARLES SPRAGUE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. While we bring our offerings for the mighty of our
      <i>own</i> land, shall we not remember the chivalrous spirits
      of <i>other</i> shores, who shared with them the hour of
      weakness and woe'? Pile to the clouds the majestic column of
      glory`; let the lips of those who can speak well, hallow each
      spot where the bones of your bold repose`; but forget not
      those who, with your bold, went out to battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Among those men of noble daring, there was <i>one</i>, a
      young and gallant stranger, who left the blushing vine-hills
      of his delightful France. The people whom he came to succor,
      were not <i>his</i> people; he knew them only in the
      melancholy story of their wrongs. He was no mercenary
      adventurer, striving for the spoil of the vanquished; the
      palace acknowledged him for its lord, and the valley yielded
      him its increase. He was no nameless man, staking life for
      reputation; he ranked among nobles, and looked unawed upon
      kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He was no friendless outcast, seeking for a grave to hide
      a broken heart; he was girdled by the companions of his
      childhood; his kinsmen were about him; his wife was before
      him. Yet from all these loved ones he turned away. Like a
      lofty tree that shakes down its green glories, to battle with
      the winter storm, he flung aside the trappings of place and
      pride, to crusade for Freedom, in Freedom's holy land. He
      came`; but not in the day of successful rebellion', not when
      the new-risen sun of Independence had burst the cloud of
      time, and careered to its place in the heavens'.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. He came when darkness curtained the hills, and the tempest
      was abroad in its anger`; when the plow stood still in the
      field of promise, and briers cumbered the garden of beauty`;
      when fathers were dying, and mothers were weeping over them`;
      when the wife was binding up the gashed bosom of her husband,
      and the maiden was wiping the death-damp from the brow of her
      lover`. He came when the brave began to fear the power of
      man, and the pious to doubt the favor of God. It was
      <i>then</i> that this one joined the ranks of a revolted
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Freedom's little phalanx bade him a grateful welcome. With
      them he courted the battle's rage; with theirs, his arm was
      lifted; with theirs, his blood was shed. Long and doubtful
      was the conflict. At length, kind Heaven smiled on the good
      cause, and the beaten invaders fled. The profane were driven
      from the temple of Liberty, and, at her pure shrine, the
      pilgrim-warrior, with his adored commander, knelt and
      worshiped. Leaving there his offering, the incense of an
      uncorrupted spirit, he at length rose, and, crowned with
      benedictions, turned his happy feet toward his long-deserted
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. After nearly fifty years, that <i>one</i> has come again.
      Can mortal tongue tell? can mortal heart feel, the sublimity
      of that coming? Exulting millions rejoice in it; and their
      loud, long, transporting shout, like the mingling of many
      winds, rolls on, undying, to Freedom's farthest mountains. A
      congregated nation comes around him. Old men bless him, and
      children reverence him. The lovely come out to look upon him;
      the learned deck their halls to greet him; the rulers of the
      land rise up to do him homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. How his full heart labors! He views the rusting trophies
      of departed days; he treads the high places where his
      brethren molder; he bends before the tomb of his "father;"
      [Footnote: Washington] his words are tears,&mdash;the speech
      of sad remembrance. But he looks round upon a ransomed land
      and a joyous race; he beholds the blessings these trophies
      secured, for which these brethren died, for which that
      "father" lived; and again his words are tears,&mdash;the
      eloquence of gratitude and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Spread forth creation like a map; bid earth's dead
      multitudes revive; and of all the pageant splendors that ever
      glittered to the sun, when looked his burning eye on a sight
      like this? Of all the myriads that have come and gone, what
      cherished minion ever ruled an hour like this? Many have
      struck the redeeming blow for their own freedom; but who,
      like this man, has bared his bosom in the cause of strangers?
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Others have lived in the love of their own people; but
      who, like this man, has drank his sweetest cup of welcome
      with another? Matchless chief! of glory's immortal tablets
      there is one for him, for <i>him</i> alone! Oblivion shall
      never shroud its splendor; the everlasting flame of Liberty
      shall guard it, that the generations of men may repeat the
      name recorded there, the beloved name of LA FAYETTE.

      THE MYSTIC WEAVER.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      REV. DR. HARBAUGH.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. Weaver at his loom is sitting,
      Throws his shuttle to and fro;
          Foot and treadle,
          Hand and pedal,
          Upward, downward,
          Hither, thither,
    How the weaver makes them go!
    As the weaver <i>wills</i> they go.
    Up and down the web is plying,
    And across the woof is flying;
          What a rattling!
          What a battling!
          What a shuffling!
          What a scuffling!
    As the weaver makes his shuttle,
    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.
 2.       Threads in single,
            Threads in double;
          How they mingle!
            What a trouble,
          Every color!
            What profusion!
          Every motion&mdash;
            What confusion!
    While the web and woof are mingling,
    Signal bells above are jingling,
    Telling how each figure ranges,
    Telling when the color changes,
    As the weaver makes his shuttle,
    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.
 3. Weaver at his loom is sitting,
      Throws his shuttle to and fro;
    'Mid the noise and wild confusion,
      Well the weaver seems to know,
      As he makes his shuttle go,
          What each motion,
          And commotion,
          What each fusion,
          And confusion,
      In the <i>grand result</i> will show:
          Weaving daily,
          Singing gayly,
    As he makes his busy shuttle,
    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.
 4. Weaver at his loom is sitting,
      Throws his shuttle to and fro;
    See you not how shape and order
      From the wild confusion grow,
        As he makes his shuttle go'?
    As the web and woof diminish,
    Grows beyond the beauteous finish:
          Tufted plaidings,
          Shapes and shadings,
          All the mystery
          Now is history:
    And we see the reason subtle,
    Why the weaver makes his shuttle,
    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.
 5. See the Mystic Weaver sitting,
      High in Heaven&mdash;His loom below.
      Up and down the treadles go:
    Takes for web the world's long ages,
    Takes for woof its kings and sages,
    Takes the nobles and their pages,
    Takes all stations and all stages.
      Thrones are bobbins in His shuttle;
      Armies make them scud and scuttle.
 6. Web into the woof must flow,
    Up and down the nations go,
    As the Weaver <i>wills</i> they go.
          Men are sparring,
          Powers are jarring,
          Upward, downward,
          Hither, thither,
    See how strange the nations go,
    Just like puppets in a show.
    Up and down the web is plying
    And across the woof is flying.
          What a rattling!
          What a battling!
          What a shuffling!
          What a scuffling!
    As the Weaver makes His shuttle
    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.
 7. Calmly see the Mystic Weaver,
      Throw His shuttle to and fro;
    'Mid the noise and wild confusion,
      Well the Weaver seems to know
          What each motion
          And commotion,
          What each fusion
          And confusion,
    In the grand result will show,
          As the nations,
          Kings and stations,
          Upward, downward,
          Hither, thither,
    As in mystic dances, go.
 8. In the Present all is mystery,
    In the Past 'tis beauteous History.
    O'er the mixing and the mingling,
    How the signal bells are jingling!
    See you not the Weaver leaving
    Finished work behind in weaving'?
      See you not the reason subtle,
    As the web and woof diminish,
    Changing into beauteous finish,
      Why the Weaver makes His shuttle,
      Hither, thither, scud and scuttle'?
 9. <i>Glorious wonder</i>! What a weaving!
    To the dull beyond believing!
      Such no fabled ages know.
    Only Faith can see the mystery
    How, along the aisle of History
      Where the feet of sages go,
    Loveliest to the purest eyes,
    Grand the mystic tapet lies!
    Soft and smooth and even-spreading
    As if made for angels' treading;
    Tufted circles touching ever,
    Inwrought figures fading never;
    Every figure has its plaidings,
    Brighter form and softer shadings;
    Each illuminated,&mdash;what a riddle!&mdash;
    From a Cross that gems the middle.
10. 'Tis a saying&mdash;some reject it,&mdash;
    That its light is all reflected:
    That the tapet's hues are given
    By a Sun that shines in Heaven!
    'Tis believed, by all believing
    That great God Himself is weaving!
    Bringing out the world's dark mystery
    In the light of Faith and History;
    And, as web and woof diminish,
    Comes the grand and glorious finish:
    When begin the golden ages,
    Long foretold by seers and sages.

      QUEEN ISABELLA OF SPAIN, DON GOMEZ, AND COLUMBUS.
    </center>
    <p>
      <i>Isabella.</i> And so, Don Gomez, it is your conclusion
      that we ought to dismiss the proposition of this worthy
      Genoese.[Headnote 1]
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don Gomez.</i> His scheme, your majesty, seems to me
      fanciful in the extreme; but I am a plain matter-of-fact man,
      and do not see visions and dreams, like some.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa.</i> And yet Columbus has given us cogent reasons for
      believing that it is practicable to reach the eastern coast
      of India by sailing in a westerly direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> Admitting that his theory is correct, namely,
      that the earth is a sphere, how would it be possible for him
      to return, if he once descended that sphere in the direction
      he proposes`? Would not the coming back be all up-hill'?
      Could a ship accomplish it with even the most favorable
      wind'?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Columbus.</i> Will your majesty allow me to suggest that,
      if the earth is a sphere, the same laws of adhesion and
      motion must operate at every point on its surface; and the
      objection of Don Gomez would be quite as valid against our
      being able to return from crossing the Strait of Gibraltar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> This gentleman, then, would have us believe the
      monstrous absurdity, that there are people on the earth who
      are our antipodes,&mdash;who walk with their heads down, like
      flies on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col.</i> But, your majesty, if there is a law of
      attraction which makes matter gravitate to the earth, and
      prevents its flying off into space, may not this law operate
      at every point on the round earth's surface'?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa.</i> Truly, it so seems to me; and I perceive nothing
      absurd in the notion that this earth is a globe floating or
      revolving in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> May it please your majesty, the ladies are
      privileged to give credence to many wild tales which we plain
      matter-of-fact men can not admit. Every step I take, confutes
      this visionary idea of the earth's rotundity. Would not the
      blood run into my head, if I were standing upside down! Were
      I not fearful of offending your majesty, I would quote what
      the great Lactantius[Headnote 2] says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa</i>. We are not vain of our science, Don Gomez; so let
      us have the quotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. "Is there any one so foolish," he asks, "as to
      believe that there are antipodes with their feet opposite to
      ours,&mdash;that there is a part of the world in which all
      things are topsy-turvy, where the trees grow with their
      branches downward, and where it rains, hails, and snows,
      upward'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col</i>. I have already answered this objection. If there
      are people on the earth who are our antipodes, it should be
      remembered that we are theirs also.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. Really, that is the very point wherein we
      matter-of-fact men abide by the assurance of our own senses.
      We know that we are not walking with our heads downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa</i>. To cut short the discussion, you think that the
      enterprise which the Genoese proposes, is one unworthy of our
      serious consideration; and that his theory of an unknown
      shore to the westward of us is a fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. As a plain matter-of-fact man, I must confess
      that I so regard it. Has your majesty ever seen an ambassador
      from this unknown coast?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa</i>. Don Gomez, do you believe in the existence of a
      world of spirits? Have you ever seen an ambassador from that
      unknown world?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. Certainly not. By faith we look forward to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa</i>. Even so by faith does the Genoese look forward,
      far over misty ocean, to an undiscovered shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col.</i> Your majesty is right; but let it be added that I
      have reasons, oh! most potent and resistless reasons, for the
      faith that is in me: the testimony of many navigators who
      have picked up articles that must have drifted from this
      distant coast: the nature of things, admitting that the earth
      is round: the reports current among the people of one of the
      northern nations, that many years ago their mariners had
      sailed many leagues westward till they reached a shore where
      the grape grew abundantly; these and other considerations
      have made it the fixed persuasion of my mind, that there is a
      great discovery reserved for the man who will sail patiently
      westward, trusting in God's good providence, and turning not
      back till he has achieved his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> Then truly we should never hear of him again.
      Speculation! mere speculation, your majesty! When this
      gentleman can bring forward some solid facts that will induce
      us plain matter-of-fact men to risk money in forwarding his
      enterprise, it will then be time enough for royalty to give
      it heed. Why, your majesty, the very boys in the streets
      point at their foreheads as he passes along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa.</i> And so you bring forward the frivolity of boys
      jeering at what they do not comprehend, as an argument why
      Isabella should not give heed to this great and glorious
      scheme? Ay, sir, though it should fail, still, it has been
      urged in language so intelligent and convincing, by this
      grave and earnest man, whom you think to undervalue by
      calling him an adventurer, that I am resolved to test the
      "absurdity," as you style it, and that forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> Your majesty will excuse me if I remark, that I
      have from your royal consort himself the assurance that the
      finances are so exhausted by the late wars, that he can not
      consent to advance the necessary funds for fitting out an
      expedition of the kind proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa.</i> Be <i>mine</i>, then, the privilege! I have
      jewels, by the pledging of which I can raise the amount
      required; and I have resolved that they shall be pledged to
      this enterprise, without any more delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col.</i> Your majesty shall not repent your heroic
      resolve. I will return, your majesty; be sure I will return,
      and lay at your feet such a jewel as never queen wore yet, an
      imperishable fame,&mdash;a fame that shall couple with your
      memory the benedictions of millions yet unborn, in climes yet
      unknown to civilized man. There is an uplifting presentiment
      in my mind, a conviction that your majesty will live to bless
      the hour you came to this decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> A presentiment? A plain matter-of-fact man,
      like myself, must take leave of your majesty, if his
      practical common-sense is to be met and superseded by
      presentiments! An ounce of fact, your majesty, is worth a ton
      of presentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isa.</i> That depends altogether upon the source of the
      presentiment, Don Gomez. If it come from the Fountain of all
      truth, shall it not be good?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> I humbly take my leave of your majesty.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What reasons did Don Gomez advance in
      proof that the earth is not a sphere? 2. What argument did
      Columbus present in proof that it was? 3. What did Queen
      Isabella resolve to do?

    <h4>
      DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      LAMARTINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. At sunrise, on the second day, some rashes recently torn
      up, were seen near the vessels. A plank, evidently hewn by an
      ax, a stick skillfully carved by some cutting instrument, a
      bough of hawthorn in blossom,&mdash;and lastly, a bird's nest
      built on a branch which the wind had broken, and full of
      eggs, on which the parent bird was sitting amid the
      gently-rolling waves,&mdash;were seen floating past on the
      waters. The sailors brought on board these living and
      inanimate witnesses of their approach to land. They were a
      voice from the shore, confirming the assurances of Columbus.
      Before the land actually appeared in sight, its neighborhood
      was inferred from these marks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The mutineers fell on their knees before the Admiral, whom
      they had insulted but the day before, craved pardon for their
      mistrust, and struck up a hymn of thanksgiving to God for
      associating them with this triumph. Night fell on these songs
      welcoming a new world. The Admiral gave orders that the sails
      should be close-reefed, and the lead kept going; and that
      they should sail slowly, being afraid of breakers and shoals,
      and feeling certain that the first gleam of daybreak would
      discover land under their bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. On the last anxious night none slept. Impatient
      expectation had removed all heaviness from their eyes; the
      pilots and the seamen, clinging about the masts, yards, and
      shrouds, each tried to keep the best place and the closest
      watch to get the earliest sight of the new hemisphere. The
      Admiral had offered a reward to the first who should cry
      <i>Land</i>, provided his announcement was verified by its
      actual discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Providence, however, reserved to Columbus himself this
      first glimpse, which he had purchased at the expense of
      twenty years of his life, and of untiring perseverance. While
      walking the quarter-deck alone, at midnight, and sweeping the
      dark horizon with his keen eye, a gleam of fire passed and
      disappeared, and again showed itself on the level of the
      waves. Fearful of being deceived by the phosphorescence of
      the sea, he quietly called a Spanish gentleman of Isabella's
      court, in whom he had more confidence than in the pilots,
      pointed out the direction in which he had seen the light, and
      asked him whether he could discern any thing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. He replied that he did, indeed, see a flickering light in
      that quarter. To make the fact still more sure, Columbus
      called another in whom he had confidence to look in the same
      direction. He said he had no hesitation in pronouncing that
      there was a light on the horizon. But the blaze was hardly
      seen before it again disappeared in the ocean, to show itself
      anew the next moment. Whether it was the light of a fire on a
      low shore, alternately appearing and disappearing beyond the
      broken horizon, or whether it was the floating beacon of a
      fisherman's boat now rising on the waves, and now sinking in
      the trough of the sea, they could not determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Thus both land and safety appeared together in the shape
      of fire to Columbus and his two friends, on the night between
      the 11th and 12th of October, 1492. The Admiral, enjoining
      silence, kept his observation to himself, for fear of again
      raising false hopes, and giving a bitter disappointment to
      his ships' companies. He lost sight of the light, and
      remained on deck until two in the morning,&mdash;praying,
      hoping, and despairing alone, awaiting the <i>triumph or the
      return</i> on which the morrow was to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. He was seized with that anguish which precedes the great
      discoveries of truth, when, suddenly, a cannon-shot, sounding
      over the sea, a few hundred yards in advance of him, burst
      upon his ear the announcement of a <i>new-born world</i>,
      which made him tremble, and fall upon his knees. It was the
      signal of land in sight! made by firing a shot, as had been
      arranged with the <i>Pinta</i>, which was sailing in advance
      of the squadron, to guide their course and take soundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. At this signal a general shout of <i>"Land ho!"</i> arose
      from all the yards and riggings of the ships. The sails were
      furled, and daybreak was anxiously awaited. The mystery of
      the ocean had breathed its first whisper in the bosom of
      night. Daybreak would clear it up openly to every eye.
      Delicious and unknown perfumes reached the vessels from the
      outline of the shore, with the roar of the waves upon the
      reefs and the soft land breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The fire seen by Columbus indicated the presence of man,
      and of the first element of civilization. Never did the night
      appear so long in clearing away from the horizon; for this
      horizon was to Columbus and his companions a second creation
      of God. The dawn, as it spread over the sky, gradually raised
      the shores of an island from the waves. Its distant
      extremities were lost in the morning mist. It ascended
      gradually, like an amphitheater, from the low beach to the
      summit of the hills, whose dark-green covering contrasted
      strongly with the blue heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Within a few paces from where the foam of the waves
      breaks on the yellow sand, forests of tall and unknown trees
      stretched away, one above another, over the successive
      terraces of the island. Green valleys and bright clefts in
      the hollows, afforded a half glimpse into these mysterious
      wilds. Here and there could be discovered a few scattered
      huts, which, with their outlines and roofs of dry leaves,
      looked like bee-hives, and thin columns of blue smoke rose
      above the tops of the trees. Half-naked groups of men, women,
      and children, more astonished than frightened, appeared among
      the thickets near the shore, advancing timidly, and then
      drawing back, exhibiting, by their gestures and demeanor, as
      much fear as curiosity and wonder, at the sight of these
      strange vessels, which the previous night had brought to
      their shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Columbus, after gazing in silence on this foremost shore
      of the land so often determined by his calculations, and so
      magnificently colored by his imagination, found it to exceed
      even his own expectations. He burned with impatience to be
      the first European to set foot on the sand, and to plant the
      flag of Spain,&mdash;the standard of the conquest of God and
      of his sovereigns, effected by his genius. But he restrained
      the eagerness of himself and of his crew to land, being
      desirous of giving to the act of taking possession of a new
      world, a <i>solemnity</i> worthy of the greatest deed,
      perhaps, ever accomplished by a seaman; and, in default of
      men, to call God and His angels, sea, earth, and sky, as
      witnesses of his conquest of an unknown hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. He put on all the insignia of his dignities as Admiral of
      the Ocean, and the Viceroy of these future realms; he wrapped
      himself in his purple cloak, and taking in his hand an
      embroidered flag, in which the initials of Ferdinand and
      Isabella were interlaced, like their two kingdoms, and,
      surmounted by a crown, he entered his boat, and pulled toward
      the shore, followed by the boats of his two lieutenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. On landing, he fell on his knees, to acknowledge, by this
      act of humility and worship, the goodness and greatness of
      God in this new sphere of His works. He kissed the ground,
      and, with his face on the earth, he wept tears of double
      import, as they fell on the dust of this hemisphere, now, for
      the first time, visited by Europeans,&mdash;tears of joy for
      the overflowing of a proud spirit, grateful and
      pious,&mdash;tears of sadness for this virgin soil, seeming
      to foreshadow the calamities, and devastation, with fire and
      sword, and blood and destruction, which the strangers were to
      bring with their pride, their knowledge, and their power.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. It was the <i>man</i> that shed these tears; but it was
      the <i>earth</i> that was destined to weep. As Columbus
      raised his forehead from the dust, with a Latin prayer, which
      his companions have handed down to us, he thus addressed the
      Sovereign Ruler of the world: (<i>sl</i>.) "Almighty and
      eternal God, who, by the energy of thy creative word, hast
      made the firmament, the earth, and sea, blessed and glorified
      be Thy name in all places! May Thy majesty and dominion be
      exalted forever and ever, as Thou hast permitted Thy holy
      name to be made known and spread by the most humble of Thy
      servants, in this hitherto unknown portion of Thy empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      15. He then gave to this land the name of San Salvador. His
      lieutenants, his pilots, and his seamen, full of gladness,
      and impressed with a superstitious respect for him whose
      glance had pierced beyond the visible horizon, and whom they
      had offended by their unbelief,&mdash;overcome by the
      evidence of their eyes, and by that mental superiority which
      overawes the minds of men,&mdash;fell at the feet of the
      Admiral, kissed his hands and his clothes, and recognized,
      for a moment, the power and the almost divine nature of
      genius; <i>yesterday</i> the victims of his
      obstinacy,&mdash;<i>now</i> the companions of his success,
      and sharers in the glory which they had mocked. Such is
      humanity,&mdash;persecuting discoverers, yet reaping the
      fruits of their inventions.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What evidences had Columbus that land was
      near? 2. What did the mutineers do? 3. In what month and year
      was the <i>new world</i> discovered? 4. What is said of the
      natives? 5. What did Columbus do on landing? 6. What was the
      conduct of the officers and seamen?

      DON GOMEZ AND HIS SECRETARY.
    </center>
    <p>
      <i>Don Gomez</i>. WHAT! what is this you tell me? Columbus
      returned? A new world discovered? Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Secretary</i>. It is even so, sir. A courier arrived at
      the palace but an hour since with the intelligence. Columbus
      was driven by stress of weather to anchor in the Tagus. All
      Portugal is in a ferment of enthusiasm, and all Spain will be
      equally excited soon. The sensation is prodigious!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. Oh, it is a trick! It must be a trick!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec</i>. But he has brought home the proofs of his
      visit,&mdash;gold and precious stones, strange plants and
      animals; and, above all, specimens of a new race of men,
      copper-colored, with straight hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. Still I say, a trick! He has been coasting
      along the African shore, and there collected a few
      curiosities, which he is passing off for proofs of his
      pretended discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec</i>. It is a little singular that all his men should
      be leagued with him in keeping up so unprofitable a
      falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G</i>. But 'tis against reason, against common sense,
      that such a discovery should be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec</i>. King John of Portugal has received him with royal
      magnificence, has listened to his accounts, and is persuaded
      that they are true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> We shall see, we shall see. Look you, sir, a
      plain matter-of-fact man, such as I, is not to be taken in by
      any such preposterous story! This vaunted discovery will turn
      out no discovery at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec.</i> The king and queen have given orders for
      preparations on the most magnificent scale for the reception
      of Columbus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> What delusion! Her majesty is so credulous. A
      practical, common-sense man, like myself, can find no points
      of sympathy in her nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec.</i> The Indians on board the returned vessels, are
      said to be unlike any known race of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> Very unreliable all that! I take the
      common-sense view of the thing. I am a matter-of-fact man;
      and do you remember what I say, it will all turn out a trick!
      The crews may have been deceived. Columbus may have steered a
      southerly course, instead of a westerly. Any thing is
      probable, rather than that a coast to the westward of us has
      been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sec.</i> I saw the courier, who told me he had conversed
      with all the sailors; and they laughed at the suspicion that
      there could be any mistake about the discovery, or that any
      other than a westerly course had been steered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Don G.</i> Still I say, a trick! An unknown coast reached
      by steering west? Impossible! The earth a globe, and men
      standing with their heads down in space? Folly! An ignorant
      sailor from Genoa in the right, and all our learned doctors
      and philosophers in the wrong? <i>Nonsense!</i> I'm a
      matter-of-fact man, sir. I will believe what I can see, and
      handle, and understand. But as for believing in the
      antipodes, or that the earth is round, or that Columbus has
      discovered land to the west,&mdash; Ring the bell, sir; call
      my carriage; I will go to the palace and undeceive the king.

      Their refuge and their all;
    And swore, while skies and waves were blue,
      That altar should not fall!
    They stood upon the red man's sod,
      'Neath heaven's unpillared bow,
    With home,&mdash;a country, and a God,&mdash;
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 4. Oh! 'twas a hard, unyielding fate
      That drove them to the seas;
    And Persecution strove with Hate,
      To darken her decrees:
    But safe, above each coral grave,
      Each booming ship did go,&mdash;
    A God was on the western wave,&mdash;
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 5. They knelt them on the desert sand,
      By waters cold and rude,
    Alone upon the dreary strand
      Of oceaned solitude!
    They looked upon the high, blue air,
      And felt their spirits glow,
    Resolved to live or perish there,&mdash;
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 6. The warrior's red right arm was bared,
      His eyes flashed deep and wild:
    Was there a foreign footstep dared
      To seek his home and child'?
    The dark chiefs yelled alarm, and swore
      The white man's blood should flow,
    And his hewn bones should bleach their shore,
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 7. But lo! the warrior's eye grew dim,&mdash;
      His arm was left alone;
    The still, black wilds which sheltered him,
      No longer were his own!
    Time fled,&mdash;and on the hallowed ground
      His highest pine lies low,&mdash;
    And cities swell where forests frowned,
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 8. Oh! stay not to recount the tale,&mdash;
      'Twas bloody, and 'tis past;
    The firmest cheek might well grow pale,
      To hear it to the last.
    The God of Heaven who prospers us,
      Could bid a nation grow,
    And shield us from the red man's curse,&mdash;
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
 9. Come, then,&mdash;great shades of glorious men,
      From your still glorious grave!
    Look on your own proud land again,
      O bravest of the brave!
    We call you from each mouldering tomb,
      And each blue wave below,
    To bless the world ye snatched from doom,
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!
10. Then to your harps!&mdash;yet louder,&mdash;higher
      And pour your strains along;
    And smite again each quivering wire,
      In all the pride of song!
(<i>f</i>.)Shout for those godlike men of old,
      Who, daring storm and foe,
    On this blessed soil their anthem rolled,
      TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!

    <h4>
      THE THREE FORMS OF NATURE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      FROM THE FRENCH OF MICHELET.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. There are three forms of Nature, which especially command
      and elevate our souls, release her from her heavy clay and
      earthly limits, and send her, exulting, to sail amidst the
      wonders and mysteries of the Infinite. <i>First</i>, there is
      the unstable <i>Ocean of Air</i> with its glorious banquet of
      light, its vapors, its twilight, and its shifting
      phantasmagoria of capricious creatures, coming into existence
      only to depart the next instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <i>Second</i>, there is the fixed <i>Ocean of the
      Earth</i>, its undulating and vast waves, as we see them from
      the tops of "the earth o'er gazing mountains," the elevations
      which testify to antique mobility, and the sublimity of its
      mightier mountain-tops, clad in eternal snows. <i>Third</i>,
      there is the <i>Ocean of Waters</i>, less mobile than air,
      less fixed than earth, but liable, in its movements, to the
      celestial bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <i>These three things</i> form the gamut by which the
      Infinite speaks to our souls. Nevertheless, let us point out
      some very notable differences. The <i>Air-ocean</i> is so
      mobile that we can scarcely examine it. It deceives; it
      decoys; it diverts; it dissipates, and breaks up our chain of
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. For an instant, it is an immense hope, the day of all
      infinity; anon, it is not so; all flies from before us, and
      our hearts are grieved, agitated, and filled with doubt. Why
      have I been permitted to see for a moment that immense flood
      of light? The memory of that brief gleaming must ever abide
      with me, and that memory makes all things here on earth look
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The <i>fixed Ocean of the mountains</i> is not thus
      transient or fugitive; on the contrary, it stops us at every
      step, and imposes upon us the necessity of a very hard,
      though wholesome gymnastic. Contemplation here has to be
      bought at the price of the most violent action. Nevertheless,
      the opacity of the earth, like the transparency of the air,
      frequently deceives and bewilders us. Who can forget that for
      ten years, Ramon, in vain, sought to reach Mount Perdu though
      often within sight of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Great, <i>very great</i>, is the difference between the
      elements; the earth is mute and the ocean speaks. The ocean
      is a voice. It speaks to the distant stars; it answers to
      their movements in its deep and solemn language. It speaks to
      the earth on the shores, replying to the echoes that reply
      again; by turns wailing, soothing, threatening&mdash;its
      deepest roar is presently succeeded by a sad, pathetic
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. And it especially addresses itself to man. It is
      creation's living eloquence. It is Life speaking to Life. The
      millions, the countless myriads of beings to which it gives
      birth, are its words. All these, mingled together make the
      unity, the great and solemn voice of the ocean. And "what are
      those wild waves saying?" They are talking of
      <i>Life,&mdash;of Immortality.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      8. An indomitable strength is at the bottom of
      Nature&mdash;how much more so at Nature's summit, the Soul!
      And it speaks of partnership, of union. Let us accept the
      swift exchange which, in the individual, exists between the
      diverse elements; let us accept the superior Law which unites
      the living members of the same body&mdash;Humanity; and,
      still more, let us accept and respect the supreme Law which
      makes us co-operate with the great Soul, associated as we
      are&mdash;in proportion with our powers&mdash;with the loving
      harmony of the world&mdash;copartners in the life of God.

    <h4>
      THE WHALE AND THE WHALER.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      FROM THE FRENCH OF MICHELET.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Who opened up to men the great distant navigation? Who
      revealed the ocean, and marked out its zones and its liquid
      highways? Who discovered the secrets of the globe? <i>The
      Whale and the Whaler!</i> And all this before Columbus and
      the famous gold-seekers, who have monopolized all the glory,
      found again, with much outcry about their discovery, what had
      so long before been discovered by the whalers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That crossing of the ocean, which was so boastfully
      celebrated in the fifteenth century, had often been made, not
      only by the narrow passage between Iceland and Greenland,
      but, also, by the open sea; for the Basques[Headnote 1] went
      to Newfoundland. The smallest danger was the mere voyage; for
      these men, who went to the very end of the <i>then</i> known
      world, to challenge the whale to single combat, to steer
      right away into the Northern sea, to attack the mighty
      monster, amid darkness and storms, with the dense fog all
      around, and the foaming waves below,&mdash;those who could do
      this, were not the men to shrink from the ordinary dangers of
      the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Noble warfare! Great school of courage! That fishery was
      not <i>then</i>, as it is <i>now</i>, an easy war to wage,
      made from a distance, and with a potently murderous machine.
      No; the fisher then struck with his own strong hand, impelled
      and guided by his own fearless heart, and he risked life to
      take life. The men of that day killed but few whales; but
      they gained infinitely in maritime ability, in patience, in
      sagacity, and in intrepidity. They brought back <i>less</i>
      of oil; but <i>more, far more</i> of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Every nation has its own peculiar genius. We recognize
      each by its own style of procedure. There are a hundred forms
      of courage, and these graduated varieties formed, as it were,
      another heroic game. At the North, the Scandinavian, the rude
      race from Norway to Flanders, had their sanguine fury. At the
      South, the wild burst, the gay daring, the clear-headed
      excitement, that impelled, at once, and guided them over the
      world. In the center, the silent and patient firmness of the
      Breton[Headnote 2], who yet, in the hour of danger, could
      display a quite sublime eccentricity. And, lastly, the
      Norman[Headnote 3] wariness, considerately courageous; daring
      all, but daring all for success. Such was the beauty of man,
      in that sovereign manifestation of human courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. We owe a vast deal to the whale. But for it, the fishers
      would still have hugged the shore; for, almost every edible
      fish seeks the shore and the river. It was the whale that
      emancipated them, and led them afar. It led them onward, and
      onward still, until they found it, after having almost
      unconsciously passed from one world to the other. Greenland
      did not seduce them; it was not <i>the land</i> that they
      sought; but <i>the sea, and the tracks of the whale</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The ocean at large is its home, and <i>especially</i> the
      broad and open sea. Each species has its especial preference
      for this or that latitude,&mdash;for a certain zone of water,
      more or less cold. And it was <i>that</i> preference which
      traced out the great divisions of the Atlantic. The tribe of
      inferior whales, that have a dorsal fin, are to be found in
      the warmest and in the coldest seas,&mdash;under the line and
      in the polar seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. In the great intermediate region, the fierce Cachalot
      inclines toward the south, devastating the warm waters. On
      the contrary, the Free Whale fears the warm waters,&mdash;we
      should rather say, that they did, formerly, fear
      them,&mdash;they have become so scarce. They are never found
      in the warm southern current; it is <i>that</i> fact that led
      to the current being noticed, and thence to the discovery of
      the <i>true course from America to Europe</i>. From Europe to
      America, the trade winds will serve us.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. If the Free Whale has a perfect horror of the warm waters,
      and can not pass the equator, it is clear that he can not
      double the southern end of America. How happens it, then,
      that when he is wounded on one side of America, in the
      Atlantic, he is sometimes found on the other side of America,
      and in the Pacific? <i>It proves that there is a
      north-western passage</i>. Another discovery which we owe to
      the whale, and one which throws a broad light alike on the
      form of the globe, and the geography of the seas!
    </p>
    <p>
      9. By degrees, the whale has led us everywhere. Rare as he is
      at present, he has led us to both poles, from the uttermost
      recesses of the Pacific to Behring's Strait, and the infinite
      wastes of the Antarctic waters. There is even an enormous
      region that no vessel, whether war-ship or merchantman, ever
      traverses, at a few degrees beyond the southern points of
      America and Africa. No one visits that region but the whaler.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What has been done by the whaler? 2. By
      whom had Newfoundland been discovered? 3. What is said of the
      courage of the whaler? 4. What proof is given that there is a
      north-western passage, by water, from the Atlantic to the
      Pacific?

      [Footnote: RI EN' ZI, the last of the Roman Tribunes, was

      8th, 1354 He was a person of extraordinary eloquence. In his
      day, Rome was a prey to contending factions of nobles. This

1. Friends!
   I come not here to <i>talk</i>. You know too well
   The story of our thralldom. We are <i>slaves!</i>
   The bright sun rises to his course, and lights
   A race of <i>slaves!</i> He sets, and his last beam
   Falls on a <i>slave</i>: not such as, swept along
   By the full tide of power, the conqueror leads
   To crimson glory and undying fame;
<i>But base, ignoble slaves!</i> slaves to a horde
   Of petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords,
   Rich in some dozen paltry villages;
   Strong in some hundred spearmen; only great
   In that strange spell,&mdash;<i>a name</i>.
2. Each hour, dark fraud,
    Or open rapine, or protected murder,
    Cries out against them. But this very day,
    An honest man, my neighbor,&mdash;there he stands,
    Was struck, <i>struck</i> like a dog, by one who wore
    The badge of Ursini; because, forsooth,
    He tossed not high his ready cap in air,
    Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,
    At sight of that great ruffian!
3.                        (<i>f</i>.) Be we <i>men</i>,
    And suffer such dishonor'? MEN, and wash not
    The stain away in blood'? Such shames are common!
    I have known deeper wrongs. I, that speak to ye,
    I had a brother once, a gracious boy,
    Full of gentleness, of calmest hope,
    Of sweet and quiet joy; there was the look
    Of heaven upon his face, which limners give
    To the beloved disciple!
4.                             How I loved
    That gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years,
    Brother at once, and son! He left my side,
    A summer bloom on his fair cheek,&mdash;a smile
    Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour,
    That pretty, harmless boy was slain! (<i>p</i>.) I saw

    Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman,
    Was greater than a king! And once again,&mdash;

      SONG OF THE FORGE.
    </h4>
    <pre>
1. Clang! clang! the massive anvils ring,&mdash;
   Clang! clang! a hundred hammers swing,
   Like the thunder-rattle of a tropic sky,
   The mighty blows still multiply:
         Clang! clang!
   Say, brothers of the dusky brow,
   What are your strong arms forging now?
2. Clang! clang!&mdash;we forge the <i>colter</i> now&mdash;
   The colter of the kindly plow;
   Benignant Father, bless our toil;
     May its broad furrow still unbind
     To genial rains, to sun and wind,
   The most productive soil!
3. Clang! clang!&mdash;our colter's course shall be
   On many a sweet and sunny lea,
     By many a streamlet's silver tide,
   Amidst the song of morning birds,
   Amidst the low of sauntering herds,
   Amidst soft breezes which do stray
   Through woodbine-hedges and sweet May,
     Along the green hill's side.
4. When regal Autumn's bounteous hand,
   With wide-spread glory clothes the land,&mdash;
   When, to the valleys, from the brow
     Of each resplendent slope, is rolled
     A ruddy sea of living gold,
   We bless,&mdash;we bless the PLOW.
5. Clang! clang!&mdash;again, my mates, what glows
   Beneath the hammer's potent blows?
   Clink! clank!&mdash;we forge the <i>giant chain</i>,
   Which bears the gallant vessel's strain,
   'Midst stormy winds and adverse tides;
     Secured by this, the good ship braves
     The rocky roadstead and the waves
   Which thunder on her sides.
6. Anxious no more, the merchant sees
   The mist drive dark before the breeze.
   The storm-cloud on the hill;
     Calmly he rests, though, far away
     In boisterous climes, his vessel lay
   Reliant on our skill.
7. Say, on what sands these links shall sleep,
   Fathoms beneath the solemn deep`?
   By Afric's pestilential shore',&mdash;
   By many an iceberg, lone and hoar',&mdash;
     By many a palmy western isle,
     Basking in spring's perpetual smile',&mdash;
   By stormy Labrador'?
8. Say, shall they feel the vessel reel,
   When, to the battery's deadly peal,
   The crashing broadside makes reply'?
     Or else, as at the glorious Nile,
     Hold grappling ships, that strive the while,
   For death or victory'?
9. <i>Hurrah!</i>&mdash;cling! clang!&mdash;once more, what glows,
     Dark brothers of the forge, beneath
   The iron tempest of your blows
     The furnace's fiery breath?
10. Clang! clang!&mdash;a burning torrent, clear
      And brilliant, of bright sparks is poured
    Around and up in the dusky air,
      As our hammers forge the SWORD.
11.   The <i>sword!</i> a name of dread; yet when
    Upon the freeman's thigh 'tis bound,
      While for his altar and his hearth,&mdash;
      While for the land that gave him birth,
    The war-drums roll, the trumpets sound,
      How <i>sacred</i> is it then!
12. Whenever for the truth and right
    It flashes in the van of fight,
    Whether in some wild mountain pass
    As that where fell Leonidas[Headnote 1];
    Or on some sterile plain and stern,
    A Marston[Headnote 2] or a Bannockburn[Headnote 3];
    Or, mid fierce crags and bursting rills,
    The Switzer's Alps, gray Tyrol's hills,&mdash;
    Or, as when sunk the Armada's[Headnote 4] pride,
    It gleams above the stormy tide,&mdash;
    Still, still, whene'er the battle word
      Is LIBERTY, when men do stand
      For <i>justice</i> and their <i>native land</i>,
    Then Heaven bless THE SWORD!

We are not always equal to our fate,

  Beset the bravest, in their high career,
At moments when the soul, no more elate
With expectation, sinks beneath the time.
The masters have their weakness. "I would climb,"
  Said Raleigh, gazing on the highest hill,&mdash;
"But that I tremble with the fear to fall."
  Apt was the answer of the high-souled queen:
"If thy heart fail thee, never climb at all!"
The heart! if that be sound, confirms the rest,
  Crowns genius with his lion will and mien,
And, from the conscious virtue in the breast,
To trembling nature gives both strength and will.

      wheat-fields across the plain, in order to supply the wants

      2. What`! build factories, turn in rivers upon the
      water-wheels, unchain the imprisoned spirits of steam, to
      weave a garment for the body, and let the soul remain
      unadorned and naked'? What`! send out your vessels to the
      furthest ocean, and make battle with the monsters of the
      deep, in order to obtain the means of lighting up your
      dwellings and workshops, and prolonging the hours of labor
      for the meat that perisheth, and permit that vital spark,

      foundations of a building which will stand, when not merely
      temple and palace, but the perpetual hills and adamantine
      rocks on which they rest, have melted away`!&mdash;that a

      WE ALL DO FADE AS A LEAF.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      GAIL HAMILTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. "<i>We all do fade as a leaf</i>." Change is the essence
      of life. "Passing away," is written on all things; and
      passing away is passing on from strength to strength, from
      glory to glory. Spring has its growth, summer its fruitage,
      and autumn its festive in-gathering. The spring of eager
      preparation waxes into the summer of noble work; mellowing in
      its turn into the serene autumn, the golden-brown haze of
      October, when the soul may robe itself in jubilant drapery,
      awaiting the welcome command, "Come up higher," where
      mortality shall be swallowed up in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Why, then, should autumn tinge our thoughts with sadness.
      We fade as the leaf, and the leaf fades only to revivify.
      Though it fall, it shall rise again. Does the bud fear to
      become a blossom, or the blossom shudder as it swells into
      fruit; and shall the redeemed weep that they must become
      glorified'? Strange inconsistency`! We faint with the burden
      and the heat of the day. We bow down under the crosses that
      are laid upon our shoulders. We are bruised and torn by the
      snares and pitfalls which beset our way, and into which our
      unwary feet often fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We are famished, and foot-sore, and travel-stained, from
      our long journey, and yet we are saddened by tokens that we
      shall pass away from all these,&mdash;away from sin and
      sorrow, from temptation and fall, from disappointment, and
      weary waiting, and a fearful looking-for of evil, to purity
      and holiness, and the full fruition of every
      hope,&mdash;bliss which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor
      heart conceived,&mdash;to a world whence all that made this
      dreary is forever banished, and where all that made this
      delightful is forever renewed and increased,&mdash;a world
      where the activities and energies of the soul shall have full
      scope, and love and recognition wait upon its steps forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Let him alone fear, who does not fade as the
      leaf,&mdash;him whose sources are not in God, and who does
      not draw his life thence,&mdash;him whose spring is gathering
      no strength, whose summer is maturing no fruit, and whose
      autumn shall have no vintage. Is not this the real sorrow of
      us all? not a dread of change, but a secret consciousness of
      wasted power,&mdash;of disloyalty to God, as the supreme
      object of our love and service.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Yet even here the fading leaf brings hope. Our future is
      always before us. The past is fixed. No tears can wash away
      its facts. Let us waste no vain regrets upon it; but, from
      the wisdom which its very mistakes and sins have bequeathed
      us, start afresh on the race. Though yesterday we were weak,
      and selfish, and indolent, let us to-day&mdash;at this
      moment&mdash;begin to be strong, and brave, and helpful, and
      just, and generous, and considerate, and tender, and
      truthful, and pure, and patient, and forgiving. "Now" is a
      glorious word. "HENCEFORTH" is always within our grasp.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. To what are we compared? 2. What is said
      of change? 3. What change takes place in the leaf? 4. What,
      in man? 5. Who have reason to fear? 6. What is said of the
      past and the future?

1. The seasons came and went, and went and came,

   Gave warning of the lapse of time, that else

   Retired, and, stooping o'er the wilderness,

   The dews came down unseen at evening tide.
   And silently their bounties shed, to teach

2. With arm in arm the forest rose on high,
   And lesson gave of brotherly regard;
   And, on the rugged mountain brow exposed,
   Bearing the blast alone, the ancient oak
   Stood, lifting high his mighty arm, and still
   To courage in distress exhorted loud.
   The flocks, the herds, the birds, the streams, the breeze,
   Attuned the heart to melody and love.
3. Mercy stood in the cloud, with eye that wept
   Essential love; and, from her glorious brow,
   Bending to kiss the earth in token of peace,
   With her own lips, her gracious lips, which God
   Of sweetest accent made, she whispered still,
   She whispered to Revenge, Forgive! forgive!
4. The Sun, rejoicing round the earth, announced
   Daily the wisdom, power, and love of God.
   The Moon awoke, and, from her maiden face
   Shedding her cloudy locks, looked meekly forth,
   And, with her virgin stars, walked in the heavens,&mdash;
   Walked nightly there, conversing as she walked
   Of purity, and holiness, and God.
5. In dreams and visions, sleep instructed much.
   Day uttered speech to day, and night to night
   Taught knowledge: silence had a tongue: the grave,
   The darkness, and the lonely waste, had each
   A tongue, that ever said, Man! think of God!
   Think of thyself! think of eternity!
6. Fear God, the thunders said; Fear God, the waves;
   Fear God, the lightning of the storm replied;
   Fear God, deep loudly answered back to deep.
   And, in the temples of the Holy One,
   Messiah's messengers, the faithful few,
   Faithful 'mong many false, the Bible opened,
   And cried: Repent! repent, ye Sons of Men!
   Believe, be saved.

      PASSING UNDER THE ROD.

      [Footnote: These lines are founded on the following passage
      of Jewish history:&mdash;"It was the custom of the Jews to
      select the tenth of their sheep after this manner: The lambs
      were separated from their dams, and inclosed in a sheep-cot,
      with only one narrow way out; the lambs hastened to join the
      dams, and a man, placed at the entrance, with a rod dipped in
      ocher, touched every tenth lamb, and so marked it with his
      rod, saying, 'LET THIS BE HOLY.' Hence, God says by his
      prophet, '<i>I will cause you to pass under the rod</i>.'"]

1. I saw the young bride, in her beauty and pride,
     Bedecked in her snowy array;
   And the bright flush of joy mantled high on her cheek,
     And the future looked blooming and gay:
   And with a woman's devotion she laid her fond heart
     At the shrine of idolatrous love;
   And she anchored her hopes to this perishing earth,
     By the chain which her tenderness wove.
   But I saw, when those heartstrings were bleeding and torn,
     And the chain had been severed in two,
   She had changed her white robes for the sables of grief,
     And her bloom for the paleness of woe!
   But the Healer was there, pouring balm on her heart,
     And wiping the tears from her eyes;
   And He strengthened the chain He had broken in twain,
     And fastened it firm to the skies!
   There had whispered a voice,&mdash;'twas the voice of her God:
   "I love thee&mdash;I love thee&mdash;<i>pass under the rod!</i>"
2. I saw the young mother in tenderness bend
     O'er the couch of her slumbering boy;
   And she kissed the soft lips as they murmured her name,
     While the dreamer lay smiling in joy.
   Oh, sweet as the rose-bud encircled with dew,
     When its fragrance is flung on the air,
   So fresh and so bright to that mother he seemed,
     As he lay in his innocence there.
   But I saw when she gazed on the same lovely form,
     Pale as marble, and silent, and cold,
   But paler and colder her beautiful boy,
     And the tale of her sorrow was told!
   But the Healer was there, who had stricken her heart,
     And taken her treasure away;
   To allure her to heaven, He has placed it on high,
     And the mourner will sweetly obey.
   There had whispered a voice,&mdash;'twas the voice of her God:
   "I love thee&mdash;I love thee&mdash;<i>pass under the rod!</i>"
3. I saw, too, a father and mother who leaned
     On the arms of a dear gifted son;
   And the star in the future grew bright to their gaze,
     As they saw the proud place he had won;
   And the fast coming evening of life promised fair,
     And its pathway grew smooth to their feet,
   And the starlight of love glimmered bright at the end,
     And the whispers of fancy were sweet.
   And I saw them again, bending low o'er the grave,
     Where their hearts' dearest hope had been laid;
   And the star had gone down in the darkness of night,
     And the joy from their bosoms had fled.
   But the Healer was there, and His arms were around,
     And He led them with tenderest care;
   And He showed them a star in the bright upper world,
     'Twas their star shining brilliantly there!
   They had each heard a voice,&mdash;'twas the voice of their God:
   "I love thee&mdash;I love thee&mdash;<i>pass under the rod</i>!"

      MR. GRIM&mdash;MICHAEL&mdash;COUSIN MARY.
    </center>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin Mary</i>. More breezes? What terrible thing has
      happened now, Cousin Grim? What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Matter enough, I should think! I sent this
      stupid fellow to bring me a pair of boots from the closet;
      and he has brought me two rights, instead of a right and
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. What a serious calamity! But, perhaps, he
      thought it was but <i>right</i> to leave the <i>left</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. None of your jokes, if you please. This is
      nothing to laugh at.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. So it would seem, from the expression on your
      face,&mdash;rather something to storm at, roar at, and fall
      into a frenzy about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Michael</i>. That's right, Miss; give him a piece of your
      mind! He's the crossest little man I have met with in the new
      country. You might scrape old Ireland with a fine-tooth comb,
      and not find such another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. How dare you talk to me in that style? I'll
      discharge you this very day!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Michael</i>. I'm thinking of discharging <i>you</i>, if
      you don't take better care of that <i>sweet temper</i> of
      yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Leave the room, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Michael</i>. That I will, in search of better company,
      saving the lady's presence.
    </p>
    <p class="rauth">
      [<i>Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. There, cousin! there is a specimen of my
      provocations! Can you wonder at my losing my temper?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. Cousin Grim, that would be the most
      <i>fortunate</i> thing that could befall you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. I mean, if you could only <i>lose that
      temper</i> of yours, it would be a blessed thing for you;
      though I should pity the poor fellow who <i>found it.</i>
      <i>Grim</i>. You are growing satirical in your old age,
      Cousin Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. Cousin Grim, hear the plain truth; your ill
      temper makes you a nuisance to yourself and every body about
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Really, Miss Mary Somerville, you are getting to
      be complimentary!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. No; I am getting to be <i>candid</i>. I have
      passed a week in your house, on your invitation. I leave you
      this afternoon; but, before I go, I mean to speak my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. It seems to me that you have spoken it rather
      freely already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. What was there, in the circumstance of poor
      Michael's bringing you the wrong boots, to justify your
      flying into a rage, and bellowing as if your life had been
      threatened?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. That fellow is perpetually making just such
      provoking blunders!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. And do you never make provoking blunders'?
      Didn't you send me five pounds of Hyson tea, when I wrote for
      Souchong'? Didn't you send a carriage for me to the cars,
      half an hour too late, so that I had to hire one myself,
      after great trouble'? And did I roar at you, when we met,
      because you had done these things'?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. On the contrary, this is the first time you have
      alluded to them. I am sorry they should have happened. But
      surely you should make a <i>distinction</i> between any such
      little oversight of mine, and the stupidity of a servant,
      hired to attend to your orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. I do not admit that there should be a
      distinction. You are both human; only, as you have had the
      better education, and the greater advantages, stupidity or
      neglect on your part, is much the more culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Thank you! Go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. I mean to; so don't be impatient. If an
      uncooked potato, or a burnt mutton-chop, happens to fall to
      your lot at the dinner-table, what a tempest follows! One
      would think you had been wronged, insulted, trampled on,
      driven to despair. Your face is like a thunder-cloud, all the
      rest of the meal. Your poor wife endeavors to hide her tears.
      Your children feel timid and miserable. Your guest feels as
      if she would like to see you held under the nose of the pump,
      and thoroughly ducked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. The carriage is waiting for you, Miss
      Somerville, and the driver has put on your baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. I have hired that carriage by the hour, and so
      am in no hurry. Your excuse for your irritability will be, I
      suppose, that it is <i>constitutional</i>, and not to be
      controlled. A selfish, paltry, miserable excuse! I have
      turned down a leaf in Dr. Johnson's works, and will read what
      he says in regard to tempers like yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. You are always quoting Dr. Johnson! Cousin, I
      can not endure it! Dr. Johnson is a bore!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. Oh, yes! to <i>evil-doers</i>,&mdash;but to
      none else. Hear him: "There is in the world a class of
      mortals known, and contentedly known, by the appellation of
      <i>passionate men</i>, who imagine themselves entitled, by
      this distinction, to be provoked on every slight occasion,
      and to vent their rage in vehement and fierce vociferations,
      in furious menaces, and licentious reproaches."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. That will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. "Men of this kind," he tells us, "are often
      pitied rather than censured, and are not treated with the
      severity which their neglect of the ease of all about them,
      might justly provoke." But he adds: "It is surely not to be
      observed without indignation, that men may be found of minds
      mean enough to be satisfied with this treatment; wretches who
      are proud to obtain the privilege of madmen,
      and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. I will hear no more! Have done!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. So the shaft went home! I am not sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. No one but a meddlesome old maid would think of
      insulting a man in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. So, when, at a loss for a vindication, you
      reproach me with being an old maid! Cousin, it does not
      distress me, either to be an old maid, or to be called one. I
      must, however, remark, that the manhood that can charge
      against a woman her single state, either as a matter of
      ridicule or reproach, is not quite up to my standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Cousin Mary, I ask your pardon! But am I,
      indeed, the petulant, disagreeable fellow, you would make me
      out?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. My dear Caspar, you are generous enough in
      large things; but, oh! consider that <i>trifles make up a
      good portion of the sum of life</i>; and so "<i>a small
      unkindness is a great offense</i>." Why not be cheerful,
      sunny, genial, in little things? Why not look on the bright
      side? Why not present an unruffled front to petty annoyances?
      Why not labor,&mdash;ay, labor,&mdash;to have those around
      you happy and contented, by reflecting from yourself such a
      frame of mind upon them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is short, at the best; why not make it cheerful? Do you
      know that longevity is promoted by a tranquil, happy habit of
      thought and temper'? Do you know that cheerfulness, like
      mercy, is twice blessed; blessing "him that gives, and him
      that takes'?" Do you know that good manners, as well as good
      sense, demand that we should look at objects on their bright
      side'? Do you know that it is contemptible selfishness in you
      to shed gloom and sorrow over a whole family by your
      moroseness and ill-humor'?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Cousin Mary, the patience with which I have
      listened to your cutting remarks, will prove to you, I hope,
      that, notwithstanding my angry retorts, I am convinced there
      is much truth in what you have said of me. I have a favor to
      ask. Send away your carriage; stay a week longer,&mdash;a
      month,&mdash;a year, if you will. Hold the lash over this
      ugly temper of mine,&mdash;and I give you my word that I will
      set about the cure of it in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cousin</i>. You should have begun earlier,&mdash;in youth,
      when the temper is pliable, and strong impressions can work
      great changes. But we will not despair. I will tarry with you
      a while, just to see if you are serious in your wish for a
      reformation, and to help you bring it about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grim</i>. Thank you. We hear of reformed drunkards, and
      reformed thieves; and <i>why may not a petulant temper be
      reformed</i>, but a system of total abstinence from all
      harsh, unkind moods and expressions? Come, we will try.

      did Cousin Mary say would be fortunate for him? 3. What

      table? 5. What does Dr. Johnson say of such men? 6. What did

      THE BRAHMIN AND THE ROGUES.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The fable, here thrown into verse, is related in
      English prose by Macaulay, who says:&mdash;"Thus, or nearly
      thus, if we remember rightly, runs the story of the Sanscrit
      Aesop."]
    </p>
    <h4>
      AN EASTERN FABLE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      VERSIFIED BY J.N. McELLIGOTT.
    </p>
    <pre>
 1. A Brahmin went out, the legends say,
    To buy him a sheep a certain day;
    For he had solemnly vowed to slay,
    In sacrifice, a sheep that day,
    And wanted a sheep his vow to pay.
        Three neighboring rogues
        (The cunning dogs!)
        Finding this out,
        Went straight about
    (Moved, I ween, by the very Old Nick,)
    To play the Brahmin a scurvy trick.
 2. So one of them met him with the cry:&mdash;
    "O Brahmin! O Brahmin! won't you buy
    A beautiful sheep? for here have I
    A beautiful sheep for sacrifice,
    As ever was seen by mortal eyes."
 3. "Where is your sheep?" replied the Brahmin;
    "Bring him out here, and let me examine."
        With that the wag
        Opened a bag,
        And out he drew
        To public view
    An ugly, dirty, horrible dog!
    Blind as a bat, and lame as a frog;
    With a broken leg, climbing a log.
    Or limping slowly over a bog.
 4. "Wretch!" said the Brahmin indignant, "who
    Shamelessly utterest things untrue,
    And dost without a scruple endure
    To handle creatures the most impure,
    How darest thou call that cur a sheep?
    Do you think, foul knave, that I'm asleep?"
 5. "<i>Cur'!</i>" said the fellow with steady tone;
    "A <i>sheep</i> it is, and a sheep alone;
    A sheep (see here, what a splendid fleece!)
    With flesh the sweetest, and fat as grease;
        And such a prize
        For sacrifice,
    As neither gods nor men can despise,
    Unless they both have dust in their eyes!"
    "Sir," said the Brahmin, surprised to find
    A person so utterly out of his mind,
    "'Tis certain that <i>you</i> or <i>I</i> am blind."
 6.     Then stepping up,
        Patting the pup,
    Rogue the second, as if amazed,
    While on the dog he steadily gazed,
    Exclaims aloud:&mdash;"The gods be praised!
    Since I've no need to market to go
    To buy me a sheep; for here's one so
    From spot and blemish perfectly free,
    That better could not possibly be.
        Isn't it nice?
        What's your price?"
 7. The Brahmin, seeing this singular thing,
    Wavered in mind, like one in a swing;
    Yet answered the stranger, firmly,&mdash;"Sir,
    This isn't a sheep, but only a cur."
    "<i>Cur</i>?" with disdain, the new-comer said;
    "Why, man, you're surely out of your head!"
 8.     As this occurred,
        Came rogue the third,
    To whom, as being a witness new,
    And likely to take impartial view,
    Brahmin proposed at once to refer,
    Whether the creature was <i>sheep</i> or <i>cur</i>.
    All being agreed, the eager priest
    Said:&mdash;"Stranger, what do you call this beast?"
    "A <i>sheep</i>, to be sure!" the knave replied;
    "As fine a sheep as ever you spied."
 9. "Well," said the Brahmin, "the gods this day
    Have surely taken my senses away!"
        Then begging the rogue
        That carried the dog,
    To pardon him for doubting his word,
    He, with a readiness most absurd,
    Purchased the creature with rice and ghee,
    Which went, of course, to the worthless three,
    And which they shared with wonderful glee.
10.     Thus taken in,
        The poor Brahmin
        Offered it up,
        The filthy pup,
    Which so offended the gods, that they
    Sent sore disease his folly to pay:
    Thinking it right the man to chastise
    For so distrusting his natural eyes,
    And being led by palpable lies
    To offer a dog as a sacrifice.
MORAL.
    Look out for the arts of the puffing tribe,&mdash;
    People that praise for the sake of a bribe;
    Lavishly lauding a book or a pill,
    Or any thing else the pocket to fill;
    Singing Simplicity fast asleep,
    And making her dream a dog's a sheep.

      QUESTIONS.&mdash;1. What trick did the three rogues play off
      on the Brahmin? 2. In what way did they do this? 3. What
      moral is taught in this fable?

    <pre>
1.                   <i>Oh, beware of debt</i>!
   It crushes out the manhood of a man,
   Robs his bright eye of boldness, cheats his limbs
   Of elasticity, unnerves his hand,
   Beclouds his judgment, dulls his intellect,
   Perils his uprightness, and stains his name,
   And minifies him to his fellow-men;
   Yea, far worse degradation, to himself.
2. Who hath the hurried step, the anxious eye,
   Avoids the public haunt and open street,
   And anxious waits for evening? Restlessly
   Tosses upon his bed, and dreads the approach
   Of the tell-tale morning sunlight? Who, unmanned,
   Starts at the sudden knock, and shrinks with dread
   E'en at his own shadow; shuns with care
   The stranger's look, skulks from his fellow's glance,
   And sees in every man a creditor?
3. The <i>debtor</i>;&mdash;he is only half a man;
   He saddens and estranges his chief friends,
   Burdens his dearest relatives; he hears
   In vain the stranger's tale, the widow's prayer,
   And sends away the orphan all unalmsed.
   None dare to place him in a post of trust,
   And business men regard him with a shrug.
4. "Owe no man aught." Stand in the world erect,
   And lean alone upon thyself and God.
   The habitual borrower will be ever found
   Wicked, or weak, or both. Sweat, study, stint,
   Yea, rather <i>any thing</i> than meanly owe.
   Let thine own honest hands feed thee and thine,
   And, if not thy friend's purse, at least, respect
   Thine own sweet independence.
5. Have fewest wants: the book, however good,
   Thou shouldst not purchase, let it go unbought;
   And fashion's vests by thee be all unworn.
   Soon luxuries become necessities,
   But self-denying thrift more joy affords
   Than all the pleasures of extravagance.
   A cottage, free from clamorous creditors,
   Is better than a mansion dunned; a coat,
   However darned, if paid for, hath an ease,
   And a respectability beside:
   Gay, ill-afforded vests can never boast.
6.                           However cheap,
   Whatever thou want'st not, buy not. That is dear,
   A mere extravagant impertinence,
   For which thou hast no need. Feel first the want
   Ere it be satisfied; bargains full oft
   Are money-wasting things, that prudent men
   Will keep afar from with suspicious eye;
   Perchance to any but of little use,
   And to themselves, most likely, none at all.
7. The habit of economy once formed,
   'Tis easy to attain to prosperous things.
   Thou then shalt lend, not borrow: shalt not want
   A helping trifle when thy friend hath need,
   Or means to seize an opportunity,&mdash;
   Seed-coin, to ensure a harvest. Thou shalt then
   Want not an alms for pinching poverty;
   And, though a sudden sickness dam the stream,
   And cut off thy supplies, thou shalt lie down
   And view thy morrows with a tranquil eye;
   Even benumbing age shall scare thee not,
   But find thee unindebted, and secure
   From all the penury and wretchedness
   That dog the footsteps of improvidence.

      GRANDEUR OF THE UNIVERSE.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      O.M. MITCHEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. If you would know the <i>glory</i> of the Omnipotent Ruler
      of the universe, examine the interminable range of suns and
      systems which crowd the Milky-Way. Multiply the hundred
      millions of stars which belong to our own "island universe"
      by the thousands of these astral systems that exist in space,
      within the range of human vision, and <i>then</i> you may
      form some idea of the <i>infinitude</i> of His kingdom; for
      lo! these are but a part of His ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Examine the scale on which the universe is built.
      Comprehend, if you can, the vast dimensions of our sun.
      Stretch outward through his system, from planet to planet,
      and circumscribe the whole within the immense circumference
      of Neptune's orbit. This is but a single unit out of the
      myriads of similar systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Take the wings of light, and flash with impetuous speed,
      day and night, and month, and year, till youth shall wear
      away, and middle age is gone, and the extremest limit of
      human life has been attained;&mdash;count every pulse, and,
      at each, speed on your way a hundred thousand miles; and when
      a hundred years have rolled by, look out, and behold! the
      thronging millions of blazing suns are still around you, each
      separated from the other by such a distance, that, in this
      journey of a century, you have only left half a score behind
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Would you gather some idea of the <i>eternity</i> past of
      God's existence,&mdash;go to the astronomer, and bid him lead
      you in one of his walks through space; and, as he sweeps
      outward from object to object, from universe to universe,
      remember that the light from those filmy stains on the deep
      pure blue of heaven, now falling on your eye, has been
      traversing space for a million of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Would you gather some knowledge of the <i>omnipotence</i>
      of God,&mdash;weigh the earth on which we dwell, then count
      the millions of its inhabitants that have come and gone for
      the last six thousand years. Unite their strength into one
      arm, and test its power in an effort to move this earth. It
      could not stir it a single foot in a thousand years; and yet
      under the omnipotent hand of God, not a minute passes that it
      does not fly more than a thousand miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. But this is a mere atom,&mdash;the most insignificant
      point among his innumerable worlds. At his bidding, every
      planet, and satellite, and comet, and the sun himself, fly
      onward in their appointed courses. His single arm guides the
      millions of sweeping suns, and around His throne circles the
      great constellation of unnumbered universes.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Would you comprehend the idea of the <i>omniscience</i> of
      God,&mdash;remember that the highest pinnacle of knowledge
      reached by the whole human race, by the combined efforts of
      its brightest intellects, has enabled the astronomer to
      compute approximately the perturbations of the planetary
      worlds. He has predicted roughly the return of half a score
      of comets. But God has computed the mutual perturbations of
      millions of suns, and planets, and comets, and worlds,
      without number, through the ages that are passed, and
      throughout the ages which are yet to come, not approximately,
      but with perfect and absolute precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The universe is in motion,&mdash;system rising above
      system, cluster above cluster, nebula above nebula,&mdash;all
      majestically sweeping around under the providence of God, who
      alone knows the end from the beginning, and before whose
      glory and power all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or
      on earth, should bow with humility and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Would you gain some idea of the <i>wisdom</i> of
      God,&mdash;look to the admirable adjustments of the
      magnificent retinue of planets and satellites which sweep
      around the sun. Every globe has been weighed and poised,
      every orbit has been measured and bent to its beautiful form.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. All is changing; but the laws fixed by the wisdom of God,
      though they permit the rocking to and fro of the system,
      never introduce disorder, or lead to destruction. All is
      perfect and harmonious, and the music of the spheres that
      burn and roll around our sun, is echoed by that of ten
      millions of moving worlds, that sing and shine around the
      bright suns that reign above.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. If, overwhelmed with the grandeur and majesty of the
      universe of God, we are led to exclaim with the Hebrew
      poet-king,&mdash;"When I consider Thy heavens, the work of
      Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast
      ordained, what is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the
      son of man, that Thou visitest him?"&mdash;If fearful that
      the eye of God may overlook us in the immensity of His
      kingdom, we have only to call to mind that other passage,
      "Yet Thou hast made him but a little lower than the angels,
      and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to
      have dominion over all the works of Thy hand; Thou hast put
      all things under his feet." Such are the teachings of the
      word, and such are the lessons of the works of God.

      THE MEMORY OF WASHINGTON.
    </h4>
    <p class="rauth">
      KOSSUTH.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Mr. President: I consider it a particular favor of
      Providence that I am permitted to partake, on the present
      solemn occasion, in paying the tribute of honor and gratitude
      to the memory of your immortal Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An architect having raised a proud and noble building to
      the service of the Almighty, his admirers desired to erect a
      monument to his memory. How was it done? His name was
      inscribed upon the wall, with these additional words: "You
      seek his monument&mdash;look around."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Let him who looks for a monument of Washington look around
      the United States. The whole country is a monument to him.
      Your freedom, your independence, your national power, your
      prosperity, and your prodigious growth, is a monument to
      Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. There is no room left for panegyric, none especially to a
      stranger whom you had full reason to charge with arrogance,
      were he able to believe that his feeble voice could claim to
      be noticed in the mighty harmony of a nation's praise. Let
      me, therefore, instead of such an arrogant attempt, pray that
      that God, to whose providential intentions Washington was a
      glorious instrument, may impart to the people of the United
      States the same wisdom for the conservation of the present
      prosperity of the land and for its future security, which he
      gave to Washington for the foundation of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. I yield to nobody in the world in reverence and respect to
      the immortal memory of Washington. His life and his
      principles were the guiding star of my life; to that star I
      looked up for inspiration and advice, during the vicissitudes
      of my stormy life. Hence I drew that devotion to my country
      and to the cause of national freedom, which you, gentlemen,
      and millions of your fellow-citizens, and your national
      government, are so kind as to honor by unexampled
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Sir, I have studied the history of your immortal
      Washington, and have, from my early youth, considered his
      principles as a living source of instruction to statesmen and
      to patriots.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in that very year in which Washington issued his
      Farewell Address, M. Adet, the French Minister, presented to
      him the flag of the French Republic, Washington, as President
      of the United States, answered officially, with these
      memorable words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Born in a land of liberty, having early learned its value,
      having engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it, having
      devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent
      establishment in my country, my anxious recollections, my
      sympathetic feelings, and my best wishes, are irresistibly
      attracted, whensoever in any country I see an oppressed
      nation unfurl the banner of freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Thus spoke Washington. Have I not then full reason to say,
      that if he were alive his generous sympathy would be with me;
      and the sympathy of a Washington never was, and never would
      be, a barren word. Washington, who raised the word "honesty"
      as a rule of policy, never would have professed a sentiment
      which his wisdom as a statesman would not have approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Sir! here let me end. I consider it already as an immense
      benefit that your generous attention connected the cause of
      Hungary with the celebration of the memory of Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Spirit of the departed! smile down from heaven upon this
      appreciation of my country's cause; watch over those
      principles which thou hast taken for the guiding star of thy
      noble life, and the time will yet come when not only thine
      own country, but liberated Europe, also, will be a living
      monument to thy immortal name.

1. Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,
   Filling the sky and earth below;
   Over the housetops, over the street,
   Over the heads of the people you meet,
       Dancing,
           Flirting,
               Skimming along!
   Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong.
   Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek,
   Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,
   Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,
   Pure as an angel, gentle as love!
2. Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,
   How the flakes gather and laugh as they go?
   Whirling about in its maddening fun,
   It plays in its glee with every one;
       Chasing,
           Laughing,
               Hurrying by,
   It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye!
   And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,
   Snap at the crystals that eddy around.
   The town is alive, and its heart in a glow
   To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.
3. How wild the crowd goes swaying along,
   Hailing each other with humor and song!
   How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by,
   Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye!
       Ringing,
           Swinging,
               Dashing they go
   Over the crust of the beautiful snow;
   Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,
   To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,
   To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,
   Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street
4. How strange it should be that this beautiful snow,
   Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!
   How strange it should be, when the night comes again
   If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!
       Fainting,
           Freezing,
               Dying alone,
   Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan
   To be heard in the crazy town,
   Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down;
   To lie and so die, in my terrible woe,
   With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
