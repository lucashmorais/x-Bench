<h1>
Malachi
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> An oracle: the word of
Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.
<p> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> &quot;I have loved
you,&quot; says Yahweh.
<p>Yet you say, &quot;How have you loved us?&quot;
<p>&quot;Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?&quot; says Yahweh, &quot;Yet I loved
Jacob;  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> but Esau I hated,
and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals
of the wilderness.&quot;  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Whereas Edom says, &quot;We are
beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;&quot; thus
says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;They shall build, but I will throw down; and
men will call them 'The Wicked Land,' even the people against whom Yahweh
shows wrath forever.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Your eyes will see, and
you will say, &quot;Yahweh is great--even beyond the border of
Israel!&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> &quot;A son honors his
father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my
honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of
Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, 'How have we
despised your name?'  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> You
offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, 'How have we polluted you?' In
that you say, 'Yahweh's table contemptible.'  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> When you offer the blind for
sacrifice, isn't that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn't
that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you?
Or will he accept your person?&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> &quot;Now, please
entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will
he accept any of you?&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> &quot;Oh that there
were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle
fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,&quot; says Yahweh of
Armies, &quot;neither will I accept an offering at your hand.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> For from the rising of the sun
even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations,
and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure
offering: for my name is great among the nations,&quot; says Yahweh of
Armies.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> &quot;But you
profane it, in that you say, 'Yahweh's table is polluted, and its fruit,
even its food, is contemptible.'  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> You say also, 'Behold, what a
weariness it is!' and you have sniffed at it,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies;
&quot;and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and
the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your
hand?&quot; says Yahweh.
<p> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> &quot;But the deceiver
is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the
Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,&quot; says Yahweh of
Armies, &quot;and my name is awesome among the nations.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> &quot;Now, you priests,
this commandment is for you.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> If you will not listen, and if you
will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,&quot; says Yahweh of
Armies, &quot;then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your
blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it
to heart.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Behold, I will
rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of
your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> You will know that I have sent
this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,&quot; says
Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> &quot;My
covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him who he
might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in
awe of my name.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The law of
truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He
walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from
iniquity.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> For the priest's
lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for
he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> But you have turned aside out of
the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted
the covenant of Levi,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> &quot;Therefore I have also made
you contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you
have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Don't we all have one
father? Hasn't one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man
against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Judah has dealt treacherously,
and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has
profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the
daughter of a foreign god.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Yahweh will cut off, to the man
who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of
Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> This again you do: you cover the
altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he
doesn't regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will
at your hand.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Yet you
say, 'Why?' Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of
your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your
companion, and the wife of your covenant.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Did he not make one, although he
had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore
take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife
of his youth.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> For I hate
divorce,&quot; says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &quot;and him who covers
his garment with violence!&quot; says Yahweh of Armies. &quot;Therefore
take heed to your spirit, that you don't deal treacherously.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> You have wearied Yahweh with your
words. Yet you say, 'How have we wearied him?' In that you say, 'Everyone
who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;' or
'Where is the God of justice?'
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> &quot;Behold, I send my
messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you
seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant,
whom you desire, behold, he comes!&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> &quot;But who can endure the day
of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a
refiner's fire, and like launderer's soap;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> and he will sit as a refiner and
purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them
as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in
righteousness.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Then the
offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days
of old, and as in ancient years.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> I will come near to you to
judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against
the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress
the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive
the foreigner of justice, and don't fear me,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
 <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> &quot;For I, Yahweh, don't
change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> From the days of your fathers you
have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to
me, and I will return to you,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies. &quot;But you
say, 'How shall we return?'  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Will a man rob God? Yet you rob
me! But you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In tithes and offerings.
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> You are cursed with the
curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Bring the whole tithe into the
storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in
this,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;if I will not open you the
windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be
room enough for.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> I will
rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of
your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the
field,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> &quot;All nations shall call you
blessed, for you will be a delightful land,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> &quot;Your words have
been stout against me,&quot; says Yahweh. &quot;Yet you say, 'What have we
spoken against you?'  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> You
have said, 'It is vain to serve God;' and 'What profit is it that we have
followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before
Yahweh of Armies?  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Now we
call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes,
they tempt God, and escape.'  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Then those who feared Yahweh
spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of
memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who
honored his name.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> They
shall be mine,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;my own possession in the
day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who
serves him.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Then you
shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him
who serves God and him who doesn't serve him.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> &quot;For, behold, the
day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work
wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them
up,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies, &quot;that it shall leave them neither
root nor branch.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> But to
you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in
its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> You shall tread down the wicked;
for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I
make,&quot; says Yahweh of Armies.
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> &quot;Remember the law
of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel,
even statutes and ordinances.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Behold, I will send you Elijah the
prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> He will turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers,
lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.&quot;

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>
