 <b>THE SPECIES OF MELITA</b></center>

<br>
 

<p class="one">A false supposition, when the consequences
proceeding from it are followed further and further, will sooner or
later lead to absurdities and palpable contradictions. During the
period of tormenting doubt&mdash;and this was by no means a short
one&mdash;when the pointer of the scales oscillated before me in
perfect uncertainty between the <i>pro</i> and the <i>con</i>, and
when any fact leading to a quick decision would have been most
welcome to me, I took no small pains to detect some such
contradictions among the inferences as to the class of Crustacea
furnished by the Darwinian theory. But I found none, either then,
or subsequently. Those which I thought I had found were dispelled
on closer consideration, or actually became converted into supports
for Darwin&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p>Nor, so far as I am aware, have any of the <i>necessary</i>
consequences of Darwin&rsquo;s hypotheses been proved by any one
else, to stand in clear and irreconcilable contradiction. And yet,
as the most profound students of the animal kingdom are amongst
Darwin&rsquo;s opponents, it would seem that it ought to have been
an easy matter for them to crush him long since beneath a mass of
absurd and contradictory inferences, if any such were to be drawn
from his theory. To this want of demonstrated contradictions I
think we may ascribe just the same importance in Darwin&rsquo;s
favour, that his opponents have attributed to the absence of
demonstrated intermediate forms between the species of the various
strata of the earth. Independently of the reasons which Darwin
gives for the preservation of such intermediate forms being only
exceptional, this last mentioned circumstance will not be regarded
as of very great significance by any one who has traced the
development of an animal upon larvae fished from the sea, and had
to seek in vain for months, and even years, for those transitional
forms, which he nevertheless knew to be swarming around him in
thousands.</p>

<p>A few examples may show how contradictions might come forth as
necessary results of the Darwinian hypotheses.</p>

<p>It seems to be a necessity for all crabs which remain for a long
time out of the water (but why is of no consequence to us here),
that air shall penetrate from behind into the branchial cavity. Now
these crabs, which have become more or less estranged from the
water, belong to the most different families&mdash;the
Raninid&aelig; (<i>Ranina</i>), Eriphin&aelig; (<i>Eriphia
gonagra</i>), Grapsoid&aelig; (<i>Aratus, Sesarma,</i> etc.),
Ocypodid&aelig; (<i>Gelasimus, Ocypoda</i>), etc., and the
separation of these families must doubtless be referred to a much
earlier period than the habit of leaving the water displayed by
some of their members. The arrangements connected with aerial
respiration, therefore, could not be inherited from a common
ancestor, and could scarcely be accordant in their construction. If
there were any such accordance not referable to accidental
resemblance among them, it would have to be laid in the scale as
evidence against the correctness of Darwin&rsquo;s views. I shall
show hereafter how in this case the result, far from presenting
such contradictions, was rather in the most complete harmony with
what might be predicted from Darwin&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<br>
<p>A second example.&mdash;We are already acquainted with four
species of <i>Melita</i> (<i>M. valida, setipes, anisochir,</i> and
<i>Fresnelii</i>), and I can add a fifth (Fig. 1), in which the
second pair of feet bears upon one side a small hand of the usual
structure, and on the other an enormous clasp-forceps. This want of
symmetry is something so unusual among the Amphipoda, and the
structure of the clasp-forceps differs so much from what is seen
elsewhere in this order, and agrees so closely in the five species,
that one must unhesitatingly regard them as having sprung from
common ancestors belonging to them alone among known species. But
one of these species, <i>M. Fresnelii,</i> discovered by Savigny,
in Egypt, is said to want the secondary flagellum of the anterior
antennae, which occurs in the others. From the trustworthiness of
all Savigny&rsquo;s works there can scarcely be a doubt as to the
correctness of this statement. Now, if the presence or absence of
the secondary flagellum possessed the significance of a distinctive
generic character, which is usually ascribed to it, or if there
were other important differences between <i>Melita Fresnelii</i>
and the other species above-mentioned, which would make it seem
natural to separate <i>M. Fresnelii</i> as a distinct genus, and to
leave the others united with the rest of the species of <i>
Melita</i>&mdash;that is to say, in the sense of the Darwinian
theory, if we assume that all the other <i>Melit&aelig;</i>
possessed common ancestors, which were not at the same time the
ancestors of <i>M. Fresnelii</i>&mdash;this would stand in
contradiction to the conclusion, derived from the structure of the
clasp-forceps, that <i>M. Fresnelii</i> and the four other species
above-mentioned possessed common ancestors, which were not also the
ancestors of the remaining species of <i>Melita.</i> It would
follow&mdash;</p>

<p>As, in the first case, among the Crabs, a typical agreement of
arrangements produced independently of each other would have been a
very suspicious circumstance for Darwin&rsquo;s theory, so also, in
the second, would any difference more profound than that of very
nearly allied species. Now it seems to me that the secondary
flagellum can by no means furnish a reason for doubting the close
relationship of <i>M. Fresnelii</i> to <i>M. exilii,</i> etc.,
which is indicated by the peculiar structure of the unpaired
clasp-forceps. In the first place we must consider the possibility
that the secondary flagellum, which is not always easy to detect,
may only have been overlooked by Savigny, as indeed Spence Bate
supposes to have been the case. If it is really deficient it must
be remarked that I have found it in species of the genera <i>
Leucotho&euml;, Cyrtophium</i> and <i>Amphilochus,</i> in which
genera it was missed by Savigny, Dana and Spence Bate&mdash;that a
species proved by the form of the Epimera (<i>cox&aelig;</i> Sp.
B.) of the caudal feet (<i>uropoda</i> Westw.), etc., to be a true
<i>Amphitho&euml;</i><a href="#1."><sup>1</sup></a> possesses it&mdash;that in many
species of <i>Cerapus</i> it is reduced to a scarcely perceptible
rudiment&mdash;nay, that it is sometimes present in youth and
disappears (although perhaps not without leaving some trace) at
maturity, as was found by Spence Bate to be the case in <i>
Acanthonotus Owenii</i> and <i>Atylus carinatus,</i> and I can
affirm with regard to an <i>Atylus</i> of these seas, remarkable
for its plumose branchi&aelig;&mdash;and that from all this, at the
present day when the increasing number of known Amphipoda and the
splitting of them into numerous genera thereby induced, compels us
to descend to very minute distinctive characters, we must
nevertheless hesitate before employing the secondary flagellum as a
generic character. The case of <i>Melita Fresnelii</i> therefore
cannot excite any doubts as to Darwin&rsquo;s theory.</p>
