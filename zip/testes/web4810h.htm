<h1>
Paul's Letter to the Galatians
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle (not from
men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father,
who raised him from the dead),  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> and all the <a
href="#N1">brothers</a> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
 <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Grace to you and peace
from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> who gave himself for our sins,
that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the
will of our God and Father-- <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> to whom be the glory forever and
ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> I marvel that you are
so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a
different &quot;good news&quot;;  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> and there isn't another &quot;good
news.&quot; Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the
Good News of Christ.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> But
even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any
&quot;good news&quot; other than that which we preached to you, let him be
cursed.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> As we have said
before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any &quot;good
news&quot; other than that which you received, let him be cursed.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> For am I now seeking the favor of
men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still
pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> But I make known to you,
brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is
not according to man.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> For
neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me
through revelation of Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> For you have heard of my way of
living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I
persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> I advanced in the Jews' religion
beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly
zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> But when it was the good pleasure
of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his
grace,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> to reveal his Son
in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately
confer with flesh and blood,  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to
those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I
returned to Damascus.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Then after three years I went up
to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> But of the other apostles I saw
no one, except James, the Lord's brother.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Now about the things which I
write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Then I came to the regions of
Syria and Cilicia.  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> I was
still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,
 <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> but they only heard:
&quot;He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried
to destroy.&quot;  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> And
they glorified God in me.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Then after a period of
fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus
also with me.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> I went up by
revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the
Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I
might be running, or had run, in vain.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> But not even Titus, who was with
me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> This was because of the false
brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we
have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> to whom we gave no place in the
way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might
continue with you.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But
from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes
no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who
were respected imparted nothing to me,  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> but to the contrary, when they saw
that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even
as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> (for he who appointed Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> and when they perceived
the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were
reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of
fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the
circumcision.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> They only
asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.
<p> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> But when Peter came to
Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> For before some people came from
James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and
separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> And the rest of the Jews joined
him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their
hypocrisy.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> But when I saw
that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I
said to Peter before them all, &quot;If you, being a Jew, live as the
Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to
live as the Jews do?
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> &quot;We, being Jews
by nature, and not Gentile sinners,  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> yet knowing that a man is not
justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even
we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in
Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be
justified by the works of the law.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> But if, while we sought to be
justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a
servant of sin? Certainly not!  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> For if I build up again those
things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> For I, through the law, died to
the law, that I might live to God.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> I have been crucified with
Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That
life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who
loved me, and gave himself up for me.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> I don't make void the grace of
God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for
nothing!&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Foolish Galatians, who
has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ
was openly set forth among you as crucified?  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> I just want to learn this from
you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of
faith?  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Are you so foolish?
Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Did you suffer so many things in
vain, if it is indeed in vain?  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> He therefore who supplies the
Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of
the law, or by hearing of faith?  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Even as Abraham &quot;believed
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.&quot;  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Know therefore that those who are
of faith, the same are children of Abraham.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> The Scripture, foreseeing that God
would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to
Abraham, saying, &quot;In you all the nations will be blessed.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> So then, those who are of faith
are blessed with the faithful Abraham.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> For as many as are of the works
of the law are under a curse. For it is written, &quot;Cursed is everyone
who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the
law, to do them.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Now that no man is justified by
the law before God is evident, for, &quot;The righteous will live by
faith.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> The law is not of faith, but,
&quot;The man who does them will live by them.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Christ redeemed us
from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is
written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> that the blessing of Abraham
might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the
promise of the Spirit through faith.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Brothers, speaking of human
terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed,
no one makes it void, or adds to it.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Now the promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, &quot;To seeds,&quot; as of many,
but as of one, &quot;To your seed,&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font> which is Christ.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Now I say this. A covenant
confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred
thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no
effect.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> For if the
inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted
it to Abraham by promise.
<p> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> What then is the law?
It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom
the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a
mediator.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> Now a mediator
is not between one, but God is one.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Is the law then against the
promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which
could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.
 <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> But the Scriptures
imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ
might be given to those who believe.  <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> But before faith came, we were
kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should
afterwards be revealed.  <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> So that the law has become our
tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> But now that faith has come, we
are no longer under a tutor.  <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> For you are all children of God,
through faith in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C3V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:27</font></a> For as many of you as were
baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <a name="C3V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:28</font></a> There is neither Jew nor Greek,
there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C3V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:29</font></a> If you are Christ's, then you are
Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> But I say that so long
as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he
is lord of all;  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> but is
under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.
 <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> So we also, when we were
children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the
world.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> But when the
fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born
under the law,  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> that he
might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of children.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> And
because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your
hearts, crying, &quot;<a href="#N8">Abba,</a> Father!&quot;  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> So you are no longer a
bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
 <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> However at that time, not
knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.
 <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> But now that you have come
to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to
the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in
bondage all over again?  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> You observe days, months,
seasons, and years.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> I am
afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> I beg you, brothers, become as I
am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> but you know that because of
weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.
 <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> That which was a
temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you
received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
<p> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> What was the blessing
you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have
plucked out your eyes and given them to me.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> So then, have I become your enemy
by telling you the truth?  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> They zealously seek you in no
good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> But it is always good to be
zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.
<p> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> My little children, of
whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you-- <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> but I could wish to be present
with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Tell me, you that desire to be
under the law, don't you listen to the law?  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> For it is written that Abraham
had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> However, the son by the handmaid
was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born
through promise.  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> These
things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount
Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in
Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in
bondage with her children.  <a name="C4V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:26</font></a> But the Jerusalem that is above
is free, which is the mother of us all.  <a name="C4V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:27</font></a> For it is written,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Rejoice, you barren who don't bear.
<dd>Break forth and shout, you that don't travail.
<dd>For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a
husband.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N9">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:28</font></a> Now we, brothers, as
Isaac was, are children of promise.  <a name="C4V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:29</font></a> But as then, he who was born
according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the
Spirit, so also it is now.  <a name="C4V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:30</font></a> However what does the Scripture
say? &quot;Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid
will not inherit with the son of the free woman.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N10">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:31</font></a> So then, brothers, we are not
children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Stand firm therefore in
the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again
with a yoke of bondage.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if
you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Yes, I testify again to every man
who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
 <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> You are alienated from
Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away
from grace.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> For we,
through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working
through love.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> You were
running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
 <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> This persuasion is not
from him who calls you.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> A
little yeast grows through the whole lump.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> I have confidence toward you in
the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will
bear his judgment, whoever he is.
<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> But I, brothers, if I
still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling
block of the cross has been removed.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> I wish that those who disturb you
would cut themselves off.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> For you, brothers, were called
for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but
through love be servants to one another.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> For the whole law is fulfilled in
one word, in this: &quot;You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> But if you bite and devour one
another, be careful that you don't consume one another.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> But I say, walk by the Spirit,
and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.  <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> For the flesh lusts against the
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one
another, that you may not do the things that you desire.  <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> But if you are led by the Spirit,
you are not under the law.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Now the works of the flesh are
obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
 <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> idolatry, sorcery,
hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions,
heresies,  <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> envyings,
murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn
you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things
will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
<p> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> But the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, <a
href="#N12">faith,</a>  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> gentleness, and self-control.
Against such things there is no law.  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> Those who belong to Christ have
crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> If we live by the Spirit, let's
also walk by the Spirit.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Let's not become conceited,
provoking one another, and envying one another.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Brothers, even if a man
is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in
a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't
tempted.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Bear one
another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> For if a man thinks himself to be
something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> But let each man test his own
work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.
 <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> For each man will bear his
own burden.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> But let him
who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.
 <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> Don't be deceived. God is
not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> For he who sows to his own flesh
will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will
from the Spirit reap eternal life.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Let us not be weary in doing good,
for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> So then, as we have opportunity,
let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are
of the household of the faith.
<p> <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> See with what large
letters I write to you with my own hand.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> As many as desire to look good in
the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be
persecuted for the cross of Christ.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> For even they who receive
circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you
circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> But far be it from me to boast,
except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has
been crucified to me, and I to the world.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> For in Christ Jesus neither is
circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> As many as walk by this rule,
peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> From now on, let no one cause me
any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
<p> <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
