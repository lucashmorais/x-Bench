<h1>
Joel
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The Word of Yahweh that
came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Hear this, you elders,
<dd>And listen, all you inhabitants of the land.
<dt>Has this ever happened in your days,
<dd>or in the days of your fathers?
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Tell your children
about it,
<dd>and have your children tell their children,
<dd>and their children, another generation.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> What the swarming
locust has left, the great locust has eaten.
<dd>What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.
<dd>What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Wake up, you
drunkards, and weep!
<dd>Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine;
<dd>for it is cut off from your mouth.
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> For a nation has come
up on my land, strong, and without number.
<dd>His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
<dd>and he has the fangs of a lioness.
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> He has laid my vine
waste,
<dd>and stripped my fig tree.
<dd>He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.
<dd>Its branches are made white.
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Mourn like a virgin
dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth!  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> The meal offering and the drink
offering are cut off from Yahweh's house.
<dd>The priests, Yahweh's ministers, mourn.
<dt> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> The field is laid
waste.
<dd>The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,
<dd>The new wine has dried up,
<dd>and the oil languishes.
<dt> <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Be confounded, you
farmers!
<dd>Wail, you vineyard keepers;
<dd>for the wheat and for the barley;
<dd>for the harvest of the field has perished.
<dt> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> The vine has dried
up, and the fig tree withered;
<dd>the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,
<dd>even all of the trees of the field are withered;
<dd>for joy has withered away from the sons of men.
<dt> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Put on sackcloth and
mourn, you priests!
<dd>Wail, you ministers of the altar.
<dt>Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,
<dd>for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your
God's house.
<dt> <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Sanctify a fast.
<dd>Call a solemn assembly.
<dd>Gather the elders,
<dd>and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Yahweh, your God,
<dd>and cry to Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Alas for the day!
<dd>For the day of Yahweh is at hand,
<dd>and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
<dt> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Isn't the food cut
off before our eyes;
<dd>joy and gladness from the house of our God?
<dt> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> The seeds rot under
their clods.
<dd>The granaries are laid desolate.
<dd>The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.
<dt> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> How the animals groan!
<dd>The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.
<dd>Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
<dt> <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> Yahweh, I cry to you,
<dd>For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,
<dd>and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.
<dt> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Yes, the animals of
the field pant to you,
<dd>for the water brooks have dried up,
<dd>And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Blow the trumpet in
Zion,
<dd>and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
<dt>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
<dd>for the day of Yahweh comes,
<dd>for it is close at hand:
<dt> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> A day of darkness and
gloominess,
<dd>a day of clouds and thick darkness.
<dt>As the dawn spreading on the mountains,
<dd>a great and strong people;
<dd>there has never been the like,
<dd>neither will there be any more after them,
<dd>even to the years of many generations.
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> A fire devours before
them,
<dd>and behind them, a flame burns.
<dt>The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
<dd>and behind them, a desolate wilderness.
<dt>Yes, and no one has escaped them.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> The appearance of them
is as the appearance of horses,
<dd>and as horsemen, so do they run.
<dt> <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Like the noise of
chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap,
<dd>like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,
<dd>as a strong people set in battle array.
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> At their presence the
peoples are in anguish.
<dd>All faces have grown pale.
<dt> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> They run like mighty
men.
<dd>They climb the wall like warriors.
<dd>They each march in his line, and they don't swerve off course.
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Neither does one
jostle another;
<dd>they march everyone in his path,
<dd>and they burst through the defenses,
<dd>and don't break ranks.
<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> They rush on the city.
<dd>They run on the wall.
<dd>They climb up into the houses.
<dd>They enter in at the windows like thieves.
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> The earth quakes
before them.
<dd>The heavens tremble.
<dd>The sun and the moon are darkened,
<dd>and the stars withdraw their shining.
<dt> <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Yahweh thunders his
voice before his army;
<dd>for his forces are very great;
<dd>for he is strong who obeys his command;
<dd>for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,
<dd>and who can endure it?
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> &quot;Yet even
now,&quot; says Yahweh, &quot;turn to me with all your heart,
<dd>and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Tear your heart, and
not your garments,
<dd>and turn to Yahweh, your God;
<dd>for he is gracious and merciful,
<dd>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
<dd>and relents from sending calamity.
<dt> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Who knows? He may
turn and relent,
<dd>and leave a blessing behind him,
<dd>even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.
<dt> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Blow the trumpet in
Zion!
<dd>Sanctify a fast.
<dd>Call a solemn assembly.
<dt> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Gather the people.
<dd>Sanctify the assembly.
<dd>Assemble the elders.
<dd>Gather the children, and those who suck the breasts.
<dt>Let the bridegroom go forth from his room,
<dd>and the bride out of her chamber.
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Let the priests, the
ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,
<dd>and let them say, &quot;Spare your people, Yahweh,
<dd>and don't give your heritage to reproach,
<dd>that the nations should rule over them.
<dt>Why should they say among the peoples,
<dd>'Where is their God?'&quot;
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Then Yahweh was
jealous for his land,
<dd>And had pity on his people.
<dt> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> Yahweh answered his
people,
<dd>&quot;Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,
<dd>and you will be satisfied with them;
<dd>and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
<dt> <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> But I will remove the
northern army far away from you,
<dd>and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,
<dd>its front into the eastern sea,
<dd>and its back into the western sea;
<dd>and its stench will come up,
<dd>and its bad smell will rise.&quot;
<dt>Surely he has done great things.
<dt> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> Land, don't be afraid.
<dd>Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.
<dt> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Don't be afraid, you
animals of the field;
<dd>for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,
<dd>for the tree bears its fruit.
<dd>The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> &quot;Be glad then,
you children of Zion,
<dd>and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;
<dd>for he gives you the former rain in just measure,
<dd>and he causes the rain to come down for you,
<dd>the former rain and the latter rain,
<dd>as before.
<dt> <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> The threshing floors
will be full of wheat,
<dd>and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
<dt> <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> I will restore to you
the years that the swarming locust has eaten,
<dd>the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,
<dd>my great army, which I sent among you.
<dt> <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> You will have plenty
to eat, and be satisfied,
<dd>and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,
<dd>who has dealt wondrously with you;
<dd>and my people will never again be disappointed.
<dt> <a name="C2V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:27</font></a> You will know that I
am in the midst of Israel,
<dd>and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;
<dd>and my people will never again be disappointed.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:28</font></a> &quot;It will happen
afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
<dd>and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
<dd>Your old men will dream dreams.
<dd>Your young men will see visions.
<dt> <a name="C2V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:29</font></a> And also on the
servants and on the handmaids in those days,
<dd>I will pour out my Spirit.
<dt> <a name="C2V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:30</font></a> I will show wonders
in the heavens and in the earth:
<dd>blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.
<dt> <a name="C2V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:31</font></a> The sun will be
turned into darkness,
<dd>and the moon into blood,
<dd>before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
<dt> <a name="C2V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:32</font></a> It will happen that
whoever will call on the name of Yahweh shall be saved;
<dd>for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
<dd>as Yahweh has said,
<dd>and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> &quot;For, behold, in
those days,
<dd>and in that time,
<dd>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> I will gather all
nations,
<dd>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;
<dd>and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,
<dd>and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the
nations.
<dd>They have divided my land,
<dd> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> and have cast lots for
my people,
<dd>and have given a boy for a prostitute,
<dd>and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> &quot;Yes, and what
are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,
<dd>and all the regions of Philistia?
<dt>Will you repay me?
<dd>And if you repay me,
<dd>I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Because you have taken
my silver and my gold,
<dd>and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,
<dd> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> and have sold the
children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,
<dd>that you may remove them far from their border.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Behold, I will stir
them up out of the place where you have sold them,
<dd>and will return your repayment on your own head;
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> and I will sell your
sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,
<dd>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,
<dd>to a faraway nation,
<dd>for Yahweh has spoken it.&quot;
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Proclaim this among
the nations:
<dd>&quot;Prepare for war!
<dd>Stir up the mighty men.
<dt>Let all the warriors draw near.
<dd>Let them come up.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Beat your plowshares into swords,
<dd>and your pruning hooks into spears.
<dd>Let the weak say, 'I am strong.'
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Hurry and come, all
you surrounding nations,
<dd>and gather yourselves together.&quot;
<dt>Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> &quot;Let the nations
arouse themselves,
<dd>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;
<dd>for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Put in the sickle;
<dd>for the harvest is ripe.
<dd>Come, tread, for the winepress is full,
<dd>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.&quot;
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Multitudes,
multitudes in the valley of decision!
<dd>For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.
<dt> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> The sun and the moon
are darkened,
<dd>and the stars withdraw their shining.
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Yahweh will roar from
Zion,
<dd>and thunder from Jerusalem;
<dd>and the heavens and the earth will shake;
<dd>but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,
<dd>and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> &quot;So you will
know that I am Yahweh, your God,
<dd>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.
<dt>Then Jerusalem will be holy,
<dd>and no strangers will pass through her any more.
<dt> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> It will happen in
that day,
<dd>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,
<dd>the hills will flow with milk,
<dd>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters,
<dd>and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh,
<dd>and will water the valley of Shittim.
<dt> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Egypt will be a
desolation,
<dd>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
<dd>for the violence done to the children of Judah,
<dd>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
<dt> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> But Judah will be
inhabited forever,
<dd>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
<dt> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> I will cleanse their
blood,
<dd>that I have not cleansed:
<dd>for Yahweh dwells in Zion.&quot;

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Joel ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web2910h.htm or web2910h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web2911h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web2910ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>
Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>


<p>Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment<br>
method other than by check or money order.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by<br>
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be<br>
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

receive it electronically.</p>
