<h1>Book 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psalms</h1>
<br><br>




<p>THE BOOK OF PSALMS</p>

<p>The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM, that is, Hymns of Praise.<br>
The author, of a great part of them at least, was king David: but many<br>
are of opinion that some of them were made by Asaph, and others whose<br>
names are prefixed in the titles.</p>

<p>
Psalms Chapter 1</p>

<p>Beatus vir.</p>

<p>The happiness of the just and the evil state of the wicked.</p>

<p>1:1. Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the<br>
ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of<br>
pestilence:</p>

<p>1:2. But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall<br>
meditate day and night.</p>

<p>1:3. And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running<br>
waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf<br>
shall not fall off: and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.</p>

<p>1:4. Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind<br>
driveth from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>1:5. Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners<br>
in the council of the just.</p>

<p>1:6. For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked<br>
shall perish.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 2</p>

<p>Quare fremuerunt.</p>

<p>The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church.</p>

<p>2:1. Why have the Gentiles raged, and the prople devised vain things?</p>

<p>2:2. The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together,<br>
against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>

<p>2:3. Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke<br>
from us.</p>

<p>2:4. He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall<br>
deride them.</p>

<p>2:5. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his<br>
rage.</p>

<p>2:6. But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain,<br>
preahing his comandment.</p>

<p>2:7. The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten<br>
thee.</p>

<p>2:8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance,<br>
and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>

<p>2:9. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in<br>
pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>

<p>2:10. And now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you that<br>
judge the earth.</p>

<p>2:11. Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling.</p>

<p>2:12. Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you<br>
perish from the just way.</p>

<p>2:13. When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all<br>
they that trust in him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 3</p>

<p>Domine, quid multiplicati.</p>

<p>The prophet's danger and delivery from his son Absalom: mystically, the<br>
passion and resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>3:1. The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.</p>

<p>3:2 Why, O Lord, are they multipied that affict me? many are they who 
rise up against me.</p>

<p>3:3 Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.</p>

<p>3:4. But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of<br>
my head.</p>

<p>3:5. I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from<br>
his holy hill.</p>

<p>3:6. I have slept and have taken my rest: and I have risen up, because<br>
the Lord hath protected me.</p>

<p>3:7. I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me: arise, O<br>
Lord; save me, O my God.</p>

<p>3:8. For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause:<br>
thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.</p>

<p>3:9. Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 4</p>

<p>Cum invocarem.</p>

<p>The prophet teacheth us to flee to God in tribulation, with confidence<br>
in him.</p>

<p>4:1. Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>Unto the end... Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that<br>
overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they<br>
suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we<br>
rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is<br>
the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to<br>
the New Testament.-Ibid. In verses, in carminibus... In the Hebrew, it<br>
is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which<br>
this psalm was to be sung.-Ibid. For David, or to David... That is,<br>
inspired to David himself, or to be sung.</p>

<p>4:2. When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was<br>
in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my<br>
prayer.</p>

<p>4:3. O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you<br>
love vanity, and seek after lying?</p>

<p>4:4. Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the<br>
Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.</p>

<p>4:5. Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be<br>
sorry for them upon your beds.</p>

<p>4:6. Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say,<br>
Who sheweth us good things?</p>

<p>4:7. The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast<br>
given gladness in my heart.</p>

<p>4:8. By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:</p>

<p>4:9. In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:</p>

<p>4:10. For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 5</p>

<p>Verba mea auribul.</p>

<p>A prayer to God against the iniquities of men.</p>

<p>5:1. Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. A psalm for<br>
David.</p>

<p>For her that obtaineth the inheritance... That is, for the church of<br>
Christ.</p>

<p>5:2. Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.</p>

<p>5:3. Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.</p>

<p>5:4. For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my<br>
voice.</p>

<p>5:5. In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see: because<br>
thou art not a God that willest iniquity.</p>

<p>5:6. Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust<br>
abide before thy eyes.</p>

<p>5:7. Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: thou wilt destroy all that<br>
speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.</p>

<p>5:8. But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy<br>
house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.</p>

<p>5:9. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct<br>
my way in thy sight.</p>

<p>5:10. For there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain.</p>

<p>5:11. Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with<br>
their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices:<br>
according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: for they<br>
have provoked thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>5:12. But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for<br>
ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name<br>
shall glory in thee.</p>

<p>5:13. For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as<br>
with a shield of thy good will.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 6</p>

<p>Domine, ne in furore.</p>

<p>A prayer of a penitent sinner, under the scourge of God. The first<br>
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>6:1. Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave.</p>

<p>For the octave... That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings.<br>
St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and<br>
the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day,<br>
after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners<br>
must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst<br>
they are here upon earth.</p>

<p>6:2. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy<br>
wrath.</p>

<p>6:3. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my<br>
bones are troubled.</p>

<p>6:4. And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord, how long?</p>

<p>6:5. Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's<br>
sake.</p>

<p>5:5. For there is no one indeath, that is mindful of thee: and who shall<br>
confess to thee in hell?</p>

<p>6:7. I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I<br>
will water my couch with my tears.</p>

<p>6:8. My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst<br>
all my enemies.</p>

<p>6:9. Depart from em, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard<br>
the voice of my weeping.</p>

<p>6:10. The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my<br>
prayer.</p>

<p>6:11. Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: let them<br>
be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 7</p>

<p>Domine, Deus meus.</p>

<p>David, trusting in the justice of his cause, prayeth for God's help<br>
against his enemies.</p>

<p>7:1. The psalm of David, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of<br>
Chusi, the son of Jemini.</p>

<p>7:2. O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; same me from all them<br>
that persecute me, and deliver me.</p>

<p>7:3. Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is<br>
no one to redeem me, nor to save.</p>

<p>7:4. O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in<br>
my hands:</p>

<p>7:5. If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly<br>
fall empty before my enemies.</p>

<p>7:6. Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life,<br>
on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.</p>

<p>7:7. Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders<br>
of my enemies. And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast<br>
commanded:</p>

<p>7:8. And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their<br>
sakes return thou on high.</p>

<p>7:9. The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my<br>
justice, and according to my innocence in me.</p>

<p>7:10. The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou<br>
shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God.</p>

<p>7:11. Just is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.</p>

<p>7:12. God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?</p>

<p>7:13. Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath<br>
bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>

<p>7:14. And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made<br>
ready his arrows for them that burn.</p>

<p>For them that burn... That is, against the persecutors of his saints.</p>

<p>7:15. Behold he hath been in labour iwht injustice: he hath conceived<br>
sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</p>

<p>7:16. He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into the hole he<br>
made.</p>

<p>7:17. His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall<br>
come down upon his crown.</p>

<p>7:18. I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: and will<br>
sing to the name of the Lord the most high.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 8</p>

<p>Domine, Dominus noster.</p>

<p>God is wonderful in his works; especially in mankind, singularly exalted<br>
by the incarnation of Christ.</p>

<p>8:1. Unto the end, for the presses: a psalm for David.</p>

<p>The presses... In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.</p>

<p>8:2. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth! For<br>
thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens.</p>

<p>8:3. Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected<br>
praise, because of thy enemies, that thou mayst destroy the enemy and<br>
the avenger.</p>

<p>8:4. For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon<br>
and the stars which thou hast founded.</p>

<p>8:5. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that<br>
thou visitest him?</p>

<p>8:6. Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned<br>
him with glory and honour:</p>

<p>8:7. And hast set him over the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>8:8. Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen:<br>
moreover, the beasts also of the fields.</p>

<p>8:9. The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, that pass through<br>
the paths of the sea.</p>

<p>8:10. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth!</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 9</p>

<p>Confitebor tibi, Domine. The church praiseth God for his protection<br>
against her enemies.</p>

<p>9:1. Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>The hidden things of the Son... The humility and sufferings of Christ,<br>
the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption;<br>
are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who<br>
know not the value and merit of them.</p>

<p>9:2. I will give lpraise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will<br>
relate all thy wonders.</p>

<p>9:3. I will be glad, and rejoice inthee: I will sing to thy name, O thou<br>
most high.</p>

<p>9:4. When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and<br>
perish before thy face.</p>

<p>9:5. For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on<br>
the throne, who judgest justice.</p>

<p>9:6. Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished;<br>
thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p>

<p>9:7. The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities<br>
thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:</p>

<p>9:8. But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in<br>
judgment:</p>

<p>9:9. And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the lpeople<br>
in justice.</p>

<p>9:10. And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time<br>
in tribulation.</p>

<p>9:11. And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not<br>
forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>9:12. Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among<br>
the Gentiles:</p>

<p>9:13. For requiring their blood, he hath remembered them: he hath not<br>
forgotten the cry of the poor.</p>

<p>9:14. Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humiliation which I suffer from<br>
my enemies.</p>

<p>9:15. Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may<br>
declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>

<p>9:16. I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in<br>
the destruction which they prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the<br>
very snare which they hid.</p>

<p>9:17. The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner<br>
hath been caught in the works of his own hands.</p>

<p>9:18. The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget<br>
God.</p>

<p>9:19. For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience<br>
of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>

<p>9:20. Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be<br>
judged in thy sight.</p>

<p>9:21. Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know<br>
themselves to be but men.</p>

<p>Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22<br>
the beginning of psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into<br>
one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And<br>
in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible.</p>

<p>(Psalm Chapter 10 according to the Hebrews.)</p>

<p>9:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in<br>
our wants, in the time of trouble?</p>

<p>9:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are<br>
caught in the counsels which they devise.</p>

<p>9:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the<br>
unjust man is blessed.</p>

<p>9:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of<br>
his wrath, he will not seek him:</p>

<p>9:5. God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy<br>
judgments are removed form his sight: he shall rule over all his<br>
enemies.</p>

<p>9:6. For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation<br>
to generation, and shall be without evil.</p>

<p>9:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deciet:<br>
under his tongue are labour and sorrow.</p>

<p>9:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may<br>
kill the innocent.</p>

<p>9:9. His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a<br>
lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so<br>
catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.</p>

<p>9:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when<br>
he shall have power over the poor.</p>

<p>9:11. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned<br>
away his face, not to see to the end.</p>

<p>9:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</p>

<p>9:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his<br>
heart: He will not require it.</p>

<p>9:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou<br>
mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou<br>
wilt be a helper to the orphan.</p>

<p>9:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin<br>
shall be sought, and shall not be found.</p>

<p>9:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye<br>
Gentiles shall perish from his land.</p>

<p>9:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the<br>
preparatgion of their heart.</p>

<p>9:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no<br>
more presume to magnify himself upon earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 10</p>

<p>In Domino confido.</p>

<p>The just man's confidence in God in the midst of persecutions.</p>

<p>10:1. Unto the end. A psalm to David.</p>

<p>10:2. In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get<br>
thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.</p>

<p>10:3. For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their<br>
arows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.</p>

<p>10:4. For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what<br>
has the just man done?</p>

<p>10:5. The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven.<br>
His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.</p>

<p>10:6. The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth<br>
iniquity, hateth his own soul.</p>

<p>10:7. He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and storms<br>
of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.</p>

<p>10:8. For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath<br>
beheld righteousness.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 11</p>

<p>Salvum me fac.</p>

<p>The prophet calls for God's help against the wicked.</p>

<p>11:1. Unto the end: for the octave, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>11:2. Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed<br>
from among the children of men.</p>

<p>11:3. They have spoken vain things, every one to his neighbour: with<br>
deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken.</p>

<p>11:4. May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that<br>
speaketh proud things.</p>

<p>11:5. Who have said: We will magnify our tongue: our lips are our own:<br>
who is Lord over us?</p>

<p>11:6. By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor,<br>
now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety: I will deal<br>
confidently in his regard.</p>

<p>11:7. The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire,<br>
purged from the earth, refined seven times.</p>

<p>11:8. Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us: and keep us from this generation<br>
for ever.</p>

<p>11:9. The wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou hast<br>
multiplied the children of men.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 12</p>

<p>Usquequo, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer in tribulation.</p>

<p>12:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou<br>
forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?</p>

<p>12:2. How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all<br>
the day?</p>

<p>12:3. How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?</p>

<p>12:4. Consider, and hear me, O Lord, my God. Enlighten my eyes, that I<br>
never sleep in death:</p>

<p>12:5. Lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They<br>
that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved:</p>

<p>12:6. But I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy<br>
salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea, I<br>
will sing to the name of the Lord, the most high.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 13</p>

<p>Dixit insipiens. 1.</p>

<p>The general corruption of man before our redemption by Christ.</p>

<p>13:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart:<br>
There is no God. They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their<br>
ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.</p>

<p>13:2. The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to<br>
see if there be any that understand and seek God.</p>

<p>13:3. They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together:<br>
there is none that doth good: no not one. Their throat is an open<br>
sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps<br>
is under their lips. &nbsp;Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;<br>
their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their<br>
ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God<br>
before their eyes.</p>

<p>13:4. Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people<br>
as they eat bread?</p>

<p>13:5. They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for<br>
fear, where there was no fear.</p>

<p>13:6. For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the<br>
counsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.</p>

<p>13:7. Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord<br>
shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,<br>
and Israel shall be glad.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 14</p>

<p>Domine, quis habitabit.</p>

<p>What kind of men shall dwell in the heavenly Sion.</p>

<p>14:1. A psalm for David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who<br>
shall rest in thy holy hill?</p>

<p>14:2. He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:</p>

<p>14:3. He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in<br>
his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach<br>
against his neighbours.</p>

<p>14:4. In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he<br>
glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour,<br>
and deceiveth not;</p>

<p>14:5. He that hath not put out his money to usury, nortaken bribes<br>
against the innocent: He that doth these things, chall not be moved for<br>
ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 15</p>

<p>Conserva me, Domine.</p>

<p>Christ's future victory and triumph over the world and death.</p>

<p>15:1. The inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord,<br>
for I have put my trust in thee.</p>

<p>The inscription of a title... That is, of a pillar or monument,<br>
staylographia: which is as much as to say, that this psalm is most<br>
worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument.</p>

<p>15:2. I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of<br>
my goods.</p>

<p>15:3. To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my<br>
desires in them.</p>

<p>15:4. Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I<br>
will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings: nor will I<br>
be mindful of their names by my lips.</p>

<p>15:5. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is<br>
thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.</p>

<p>15:6. The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance<br>
is goodly to me.</p>

<p>15:7. I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover,<br>
my reins also have corrected me even till night.</p>

<p>15:8. I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand,<br>
that I be not moved.</p>

<p>15:9. Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced:<br>
moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>

<p>15:10. Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give<br>
thy holy one to see corruption.</p>

<p>15:11. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me<br>
with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to<br>
the end.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 16</p>

<p>Exaudi, Domine, justitiam.</p>

<p>A just man's prayer in tribulation against the malice of his enemy.</p>

<p>16:1. The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my<br>
supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from<br>
deceitful lips.</p>

<p>16:2. Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes<br>
behold the things that are equitable.</p>

<p>16:3. Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast<br>
tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.</p>

<p>16:4. That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the<br>
words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</p>

<p>16:5. Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not<br>
moved.</p>

<p>16:6. I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline<br>
thy ear unto me, and hear my words.</p>

<p>16:7. Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust<br>
in thee.</p>

<p>16:8. From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy<br>
eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.</p>

<p>16:9. From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have<br>
surrounded my soul:</p>

<p>16:10. They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.</p>

<p>Their fat... That is, their bowels of compassion: for they have none for<br>
me.</p>

<p>16:11. They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they<br>
have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.</p>

<p>16:12. They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a<br>
young lion dwelling in secret places.</p>

<p>16:13. Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul<br>
from the wicked one; thy sword</p>

<p>16:14. From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of<br>
the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br>
They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the<br>
rest of their substance.</p>

<p>Divide them from the few, etc... That is, cut them off from the earth,<br>
and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so proud of, or<br>
divide them from the few; that is, from thy elect, who are but few; that<br>
they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them. It is not<br>
meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but, as many other the like<br>
passages in the psalms, by way of a prediction, or prophecy of what<br>
should come upon them, in punishment of their wickedness. Ibid. Thy<br>
hidden stores... Thy secret treasures, out of which thou furnishest<br>
those earthly goods, which, with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed<br>
both to the good and the bad.</p>

<p>16:15. But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall<br>
be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 17</p>

<p>Diligam te, Domine.</p>

<p>David's thanks to God for his delivery from all his enemies.</p>

<p>17:1. Unto the end, for David, the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the<br>
Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him<br>
from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he<br>
said:</p>

<p>17:2. I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:</p>

<p>17:3. The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is<br>
my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector, and the horn of<br>
my salvation, and my support.</p>

<p>17:4. Praising, I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my<br>
enemies.</p>

<p>17:5. The sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity<br>
troubled me.</p>

<p>17:6. The sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death<br>
prevented me.</p>

<p>17:7. In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God:<br>
And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came<br>
into his ears.</p>

<p>17:8. The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains<br>
were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.</p>

<p>17:9. There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his<br>
face: coals were kindled by it.</p>

<p>17:10. He bowed the heavens, and came down, and darkness was under his<br>
feet.</p>

<p>17:11. And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the<br>
wings of the winds.</p>

<p>17:12. And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him:<br>
dark waters in the clouds of the air.</p>

<p>17:13. At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and<br>
coals of fire.</p>

<p>17:14. And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Highest gave his<br>
voice: hail and coals of fire.</p>

<p>17:15. And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he<br>
multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.</p>

<p>17:16. Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the<br>
world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the spirit<br>
of thy wrath.</p>

<p>17:17. He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many<br>
waters.</p>

<p>17:18. He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that<br>
hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p>17:19. They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the Lord<br>
became my rotector.</p>

<p>17:20. And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because<br>
he was well pleased with me.</p>

<p>17:21. And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will<br>
repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:</p>

<p>17:22. Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done<br>
wickedly against my God.</p>

<p>17:23. For all his judgments are in my sight: and his justices I have<br>
not put away from me.</p>

<p>17:24. And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself from my<br>
iniquity.</p>

<p>17:25. And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: and<br>
according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.</p>

<p>17:26. With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou<br>
wilt be innocent:</p>

<p>17:27. And withe the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse<br>
thou wilt be perverted.</p>

<p>17:28. For thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down the<br>
eyes of the proud.</p>

<p>17:29. For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my<br>
darkness.</p>

<p>17:30. For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; and through my<br>
God I shall go over a wall.</p>

<p>17:31. As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are<br>
fire-tried: he is the protector of all that trust in him.</p>

<p>17:32. For who is God but the Lord? or who is God but our God?</p>

<p>17:33. God, who hath girt me with strength; and made my way blameless.</p>

<p>17:34. Who hath made my feet like the feet of harts: and who setteth me<br>
upon high places.</p>

<p>17:35. Who teacheth my hands to war: and thou hast made my arms like a<br>
brazen bow.</p>

<p>17:36. And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation: and thy<br>
right hand hath held me up: And thy discipline hath corrected me unto<br>
the end: and thy discipline, the same shall teach me.</p>

<p>17:37. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; and my feet are not<br>
weakened.</p>

<p>17:38. I will pursue after my enemies, and overtake them: and I will not<br>
turn again till they are consumed.</p>

<p>17:39. I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: they<br>
shall fall under my feet.</p>

<p>17:40. And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; and hast<br>
subdued under me them that rose up against me.</p>

<p>17:41. And thou hast made my enemies furn their back upon me, and hast<br>
destroyed them that hated me.</p>

<p>17:42. They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord: but he<br>
heard them not.</p>

<p>17:43. And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind; I<br>
shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the streets.</p>

<p>17:44. Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; thou<br>
wilt make me head of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>17:45. A people which I knew not, hath seerved me: at the hearing of the<br>
ear they have obeyed me.</p>

<p>17:46. The children that are strangers have lied to me, strange children<br>
have faded away, and have halted from their paths.</p>

<p>17:47. The Lord liveth, and blessed by my God, and let the God of my<br>
salvation be exalted.</p>

<p>17:48. O God, who avengest me, and subduest the people under me, my<br>
deliverer from my enraged enemies.</p>

<p>17:49. And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me: from<br>
the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.</p>

<p>17:50. Therefore will I give glory to thee, O Lord, among the nations,<br>
and I will sing a psalm to thy name.</p>

<p>17:51. Giving great deliverance to his king, and shewing mercy to David,<br>
his anointed: and to his seed for ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 18</p>

<p>Coeli enarrant.</p>

<p>The works of God shew forth his glory: his law is greatly to be esteemed<br>
and loved.</p>

<p>18:1. Unto the end. APsalm Chapter for David.</p>

<p>18:2. The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament<br>
declareth the work of his hands.</p>

<p>18:3. Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge.</p>

<p>18:4. There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not<br>
heard.</p>

<p>18:5. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words<br>
unto the ends of the world.</p>

<p>18:6. He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: and he as a bridegroom<br>
coming out of his bridechamber, Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way:</p>

<p>18:7. His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to<br>
the end thereof: and ther is no one that can hide himself from his heat.</p>

<p>18:8. The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: the testimony<br>
of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.</p>

<p>18:9. The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the<br>
commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.</p>

<p>18:10. The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the<br>
judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.</p>

<p>18:11. More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and<br>
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</p>

<p>18:12. For thy servant keepeth them, and in keeping them there is a<br>
great reward.</p>

<p>18:13. Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord:</p>

<p>18:14. And from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no<br>
dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed<br>
form the greatest sin.</p>

<p>18:15. And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the<br>
meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper and my<br>
Redeemer.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 19</p>

<p>Exaudiat te Dominus.</p>

<p>A prayer for the king.</p>

<p>19:1. Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>19:2. May the Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation: may the name of<br>
the God of Jacob protect thee.</p>

<p>19:3. May he send thee help from the sanctuary: and defend thee outof<br>
Sion.</p>

<p>19:4. May he be mindful of all thy sacrifices: and may thy whole<br>
burntoffering be made fat.</p>

<p>19:5. May he give thee according to thy own heart; and confirm all thy<br>
counsels.</p>

<p>19:6. We will rejoice in thy salvation; and in the name of our God we<br>
shall be exalted.</p>

<p>19:7. The Lord fulfil all thy petitions: now have I known that the Lord<br>
hath saved his anointed. He will hear him from his holy heaven: the<br>
salvation of his right hand is in powers.</p>

<p>The salvation of his right hand is in powers... That is, in strength.<br>
His right hand is strong and mighty to save them that trust in him.</p>

<p>19:8. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will call upon<br>
the name of the Lord, our God.</p>

<p>19:9. They are bound, and have fallen: but we are risen, and are set<br>
upright. O Lord, save the king: and hear us in the day that we shall<br>
call upon thee.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 20</p>

<p>Domine, in virtute.</p>

<p>Praise to God for Christ's exaltation after his passion.</p>

<p>20:1. Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>20:2. In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation<br>
he shall rejoice exceedingly.</p>

<p>20:3. Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not withholden<br>
from him the will of his lips.</p>

<p>20:4. For thou hast prevented him with belssings of sweetness: thou hast<br>
set on his head a crown of precious stones.</p>

<p>20:5. He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for<br>
ever and ever.</p>

<p>20:6. His glory is great in thy salvation: glory and great beauty shalt<br>
thou lay upon hom.</p>

<p>20:7. For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou<br>
shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.</p>

<p>20:8. For the king hopeth in the Lord: andthrough the mercy of the most<br>
High he whall not be moved.</p>

<p>20:9. Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: let thy right hand find<br>
out all them that hate thee.</p>

<p>20:10. Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy<br>
anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour<br>
them.</p>

<p>20:11. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: and their seed<br>
from among the children of men.</p>

<p>20:12. For they have intended evils against thee: they have devised<br>
counsels which they have not been able to establish.</p>

<p>20:13. For thou shalt make them turn their back: in thy remnants thou<br>
shalt prepare their face.</p>

<p>In thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face... Or thou shalt set thy<br>
remnants against their faces. That is, thou shalt make them see what<br>
punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice. Instead of<br>
remnants, St. Jerome renders it funes, that is, cords or strings, viz.,<br>
of the bow of divine justice, from which God directs his arrows against<br>
the faces of his enemies.</p>

<p>20:14. Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: we will sing and<br>
praise thy power.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 21</p>

<p>Deus Deus meus.</p>

<p>Christ's passion: and the conversion of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>21:1. Unto the end, for the morning protection, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>21:2. O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my<br>
salvation are the words of my sins.</p>

<p>The words of my sins... That is, the sins of the world, which I have<br>
taken upon myself, cry out against me, and are the cause of all my<br>
sufferings.</p>

<p>21:3. O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by<br>
night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.</p>

<p>21:4. But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.</p>

<p>21:5. In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast<br>
delivered them.</p>

<p>21:6. They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and<br>
were not confounded.</p>

<p>21:7. Bukt I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast<br>
of the prople.</p>

<p>21:8. All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken<br>
with the lips, and wagged the head.</p>

<p>21:9. He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him,<br>
seeing he delighteth in him.</p>

<p>21:10. For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from<br>
the breasts of my mother.</p>

<p>21:11. I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother's womb thou<br>
art my God,</p>

<p>21:12. Depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is<br>
none to help me.</p>

<p>21:13. Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.</p>

<p>21:14. They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and<br>
roaring.</p>

<p>21:15. I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My<br>
heart is become like wax melting in the midast of my bowels.</p>

<p>21:16. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath<br>
cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of<br>
death.</p>

<p>21:17. For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant<br>
hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet.</p>

<p>21:18. They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared<br>
upon me.</p>

<p>21:19. They lparted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they<br>
cast lots.</p>

<p>21:20. But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look<br>
towards my defence.</p>

<p>21:21. Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand<br>
of the dog.</p>

<p>21:22. Save me from the lion's mouth; and my lowness from the horns of<br>
the unicorns.</p>

<p>21:23. I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the<br>
church will I praise thee.</p>

<p>21:24. Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob,<br>
glorify him.</p>

<p>21:25. Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted<br>
nor despised the supplication of the poor man. Neither hath he turned<br>
away his face form me: and when I cried to him he heard me.</p>

<p>21:26. With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in<br>
the sight of them that fear him.</p>

<p>21:27. The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the<br>
Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.</p>

<p>21:28. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted<br>
to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his<br>
sight.</p>

<p>21:29. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he shall have dominion over<br>
the nations.</p>

<p>21:30. All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all<br>
they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.</p>

Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebreateth<br>
me, how goodly is it!</p>

Glory.</p>

may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may<br>
see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</p>

hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</p>

<p>26:6. He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head<br>

unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to<br>
itself.</p>

living.</p>

them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>27:2. Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee;<br>
when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.</p>

<p>27:3. Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of<br>
iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils<br>
are in their hearts.</p>

<p>27:4. Give them according to their works, and according to the<br>
wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands<br>
give thou to them: render to them their reward.</p>

<p>27:5. Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the<br>
operations of his hands: thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build<br>
them up.</p>

supplication.</p>

magnificence.</p>

<p>28:5. The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord shall<br>
break the cedars of Libanus.</p>

<p>28:6. And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of Libanus, and as the<br>
beloved son of unicorns.</p>

<p>Shall reduce them to pieces, etc... In Hebrew, shall make them to skip<br>
like a calf. The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder (which<br>
he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest<br>
and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip, etc. All this<br>
is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of God's word in<br>
his church; which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world,<br>
and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to<br>
the sweet yoke of Christ.</p>

<p>28:7. The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire:</p>

the desert of Cades.</p>

the thick woods: and in his temple all shall speak his glory.</p>

<p>28:10. The Lord maketh the flood to dwell: and the Lord shall sit king<br>
for ever. The Lord will give strength to his people: the Lord will bless<br>
his people with peace.</p>

<p>29:4. Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast<br>
saved me from them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>29:5. Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory<br>
of his holiness.</p>

<p>29:6. For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the<br>
evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.</p>

<p>29:7. And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.</p>

<p>29:8. O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou<br>
turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.</p>

<p>29:9. To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my<br>
God.</p>

<p>29:10. What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption?<br>

helper.</p>

sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness:</p>

O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.</p>

<p>30:2. In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver<br>
me in thy justice.</p>

a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.</p>

<p>30:4. For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake<br>
thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.</p>

me: for thou art my protector.</p>

<p>30:6. Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord,<br>
the God of truth.</p>

<p>30:7. Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I<br>
have hoped in the Lord:</p>

<p>30:8. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou hast regarded my<br>
humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.</p>

<p>30:9. And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast<br>
set my feet in a spacious place.</p>

<p>30:10. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled<br>
with wrath, my soul, and my belly:</p>

<p>30:11. For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My<br>
strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.</p>

<p>30:12. I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my<br>
neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled<br>
from me.</p>

<p>30:13. I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a<br>
vessel that is destroyed.</p>

<p>30:14. For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While<br>
they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.</p>

<p>30:15. But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.</p>

<p>30:16. My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my<br>
enemies; and from them that persecute me.</p>

just, with pride and abuse.</p>

<p>30:20. O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou<br>
hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrougth for them<br>
that hope inthee, in the sight of the sons of men.</p>

<p>30:21. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the<br>
disturbance of men. Thoushalt protect them in thy tabernacle form the<br>
contradiction of tongues.</p>

<p>30:22. Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me<br>
in a fortified city.</p>

<p>30:23. But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before<br>
thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried<br>
to thee.</p>

<p>30:24. O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require<br>
truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.</p>

<p>30:25. Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that<br>
hope in the Lord.</p>

day long.</p>

concealing, or refusing to confess my sins, thy hand was heavy upon me,<br>
etc.</p>

<p>31:4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my<br>
anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.</p>

<p>I am turned, etc... That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for<br>
ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and<br>
sticks fast in me. Or, I am turned: that is, I am converted to thee, my<br>
God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In<br>
the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer.</p>

<p>31:5. I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not<br>
concealed. I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the<br>
Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.</p>

<p>31:6. For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable<br>
time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto<br>
him.</p>

<p>31:7. Thou art my fefuge from the trouble which hath eencompassed me: my<br>
joy, deliver me from them that surround me.</p>

<p>31:8. I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this<br>
way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee.</p>

understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not<br>

him that hopeth in the Lord.</p>

his heart to all generations.</p>

hath chosen for his inheritance.</p>

seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.</p>

<p>33:12. Come, children, hearken to me: I will teach you the fear of the<br>
Lord.</p>

<p>33:13. Who is the man that desireth life: who liveth to see good days?</p>

<p>33:14. Keep thy tongue form evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>

<p>33:15. Tkurn away from evil and do good: seek after peace and pursue it.</p>

<p>33:16. The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: and his ears unto their<br>
prayers.</p>

<p>33:17. But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil<br>
things: to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

<p>33:18. The just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out<br>
of all their troubles.</p>

<p>33:19. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he<br>
will save the humble of spirit.</p>

<p>33:20. Many are the afflictions of the just; but out of them all will<br>
the Lord deliver them.</p>

<p>33:21. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he<br>
will save the humble of spirit.</p>

<p>33:22. The death of the wicked is very evil: and they that hate the just<br>
shall be guilty.</p>

<p>33:23. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of them<br>
that trust in him shall offend.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 34</p>

<p>Judica, Domine, nocentes me.</p>

<p>David, in the person of Christ, prayeth against his persecutors:<br>
prophetecally foreshewing the punishments that shall fall upon them.</p>

<p>34:1. For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me:<br>
overthrow them that fight against me.</p>

<p>34:2. Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me.</p>

<p>34:3. Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that<br>
persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation.</p>

<p>34:4. Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let<br>
them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me.</p>

<p>34:5. Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the<br>
Lord straiten them.</p>

<p>34:6. Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the<br>
Lord pursue them.</p>

<p>34:7. For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto<br>
destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul.</p>

<p>34:8. Let the snae which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net<br>
which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall.</p>

<p>34:9. But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in<br>
his salvation.</p>

<p>34:10. All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest<br>
the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and<br>
the poor from them that strip him.</p>

<p>34:11. Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.</p>

<p>34:12. They repaid me evil for good: to the depriving me of my soul.</p>

<p>34:13. But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed<br>
with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be<br>
turned into my bosom.</p>

<p>34:14. As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one<br>
mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.</p>

<p>34:15. But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were<br>
gathered together upon me, and I knew not.</p>

<p>34:16. They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they<br>
scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed ukpon me with their teeth.</p>

<p>34:17. Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their<br>
malice: my only one from the lions.</p>

<p>34:18. I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee<br>
in a strong people.</p>

<p>34:19. Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: who<br>
have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.</p>

<p>34:20. For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger<br>
of the earth they devised guile.</p>

<p>34:21. And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well<br>
done, well done, our eyes have seen it.</p>

<p>34:22. Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not<br>
from me.</p>

<p>34:23. Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and<br>
my Lord.</p>

<p>34:24. Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them<br>
not rejoice over me.</p>

<p>34:25. Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our<br>
mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.</p>

<p>34:26. Let them blush: and be ashamed to gether, who rejoice at my<br>
evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great<br>
things against me.</p>

<p>34:27. Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my<br>
justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in<br>
the peace of his servant.</p>

<p>34:28. And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day<br>
long.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 35</p>

<p>Dixit injustus.</p>

<p>The malice of sinners, and the goodness of God.</p>

<p>35:1. Unto the end, for the servant of God, David himself.</p>

<p>35:2. The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is<br>
no fear of God before his eyes.</p>

<p>35:3. For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may<br>
be found unto hatred.</p>

<p>Unto hatred... That is, hateful to God.</p>

<p>35:4. The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: he would not<br>
understand that he might do well.</p>

<p>35:5. He hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every<br>
way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.</p>

<p>35:6. O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the<br>
clouds.</p>

<p>35:7. Thy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great<br>
deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord:</p>

<p>35:8. O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of<br>
men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.</p>

<p>35:9. They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou<br>
shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.</p>

<p>35:10. For with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall<br>
see light.</p>

<p>35:11. Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them<br>
that are right in heart.</p>

<p>35:12. Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the<br>
sinner move me.</p>

<p>35:13. There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and<br>
could not stand.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 36</p>

<p>Noli aemulari.</p>

<p>An exhortation to despise this world; and the short prosperity of the<br>
wicked; and to trust in Providence.</p>

<p>36:1. Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>36:2. For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green<br>
herbs shall quickly fall.</p>

<p>36:3. Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou<br>
shalt be fed with its riches.</p>

<p>36:4. Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy<br>
heart.</p>

<p>36:5. Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.</p>

<p>36:6. And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment<br>
as the noonday.</p>

<p>36:7. Be subject to the Lord and pray to him. Envy not the man who<br>
prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.</p>

<p>36:8. Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.</p>

<p>36:9. For evildoers shall be cut off: but they that wait upon the Lord,<br>
they shall inherit the land.</p>

<p>36:10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: and thou<br>
shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.</p>

<p>36:11. But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in<br>
abundance of peace.</p>

<p>36:12. The sinner shall watch the just man: and shall gnash upon him<br>
with his teeth.</p>

<p>36:13. But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foreseeth that his day<br>
shall come.</p>

<p>36:14. The wicked have drawn out the sword: they have bent their bow. To<br>
cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.</p>

<p>36:15. Let their sword enter into their own hearts, andlet their bow be<br>
broken.</p>

<p>36:16. Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the<br>
wicked.</p>

<p>36:17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the<br>
Lord strengtheneth the just.</p>

<p>36:18. The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; and their inheritance<br>
shall be for ever.</p>

<p>36:19. They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of<br>
famine they shall be filled:</p>

<p>36:20. Because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord,<br>
presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to<br>
nothing and vanish like smoke.</p>

<p>36:21. The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth<br>
mercy and shall give.</p>

<p>36:22. For such as bless him shall inherit the land: but such as curse<br>
him shall perish.</p>

<p>36:23. With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall<br>
like well his way.</p>

<p>36:24. When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth<br>
his hand under him.</p>

<p>36:25. I have been young and now am old; and I have not seen the just<br>
forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.</p>

<p>36:26. He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed<br>
shall be in blessing.</p>

<p>36:27. Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.</p>

<p>36:28. For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints:<br>
they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the<br>
seed of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>36:29. But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for<br>
evermore.</p>

<p>36:30. The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: and his tongue shall<br>
speak judgment.</p>

<p>36:31. The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be<br>
supplanted.</p>

<p>36:32. The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to<br>
death,</p>

<p>36:33. But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; nor condemn him<br>
when he shall be judged.</p>

<p>36:34. Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to<br>
inherit the land: when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.</p>

<p>36:35. I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted ukp like the<br>
cedars of Libanus.</p>

<p>36:36. And I passed by, and lo, he was not: and I sought him and his<br>
place was not found.</p>

<p>36:37. Keep innocence, and behold justice: for there are remnants for<br>
the peaceable man.</p>

<p>36:38. But the unjust shall be destroyed to gether: the remnants of the<br>
wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>36:39. But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their<br>
protector in the time of trouble.</p>

<p>36:40. And the Lord will help them and deliver them: and he will rescue<br>
them from the wicked, and save them because they have hoped in him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 37</p>

<p>Domine, ne in furore.</p>

<p>A prayer of a penitent for the remission of his sins. The third<br>
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>37:1. A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.</p>

<p>For a remembrance... Viz., of our miseries and sins: and to be sung on<br>
the sabbath day.</p>

<p>37:2. Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy<br>
wrath.</p>

<p>37:3. For thy arrows are fastened in me: and thy hand hath been strong<br>
upon me.</p>

<p>37:4. There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: there is no<br>
peace for my bones, because of my sins.</p>

<p>37:5. For my iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are<br>
become heavy upon me.</p>

<p>37:6. My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.</p>

<p>37:7. I am bcome miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: I walked<br>
sorrowfull all the day long.</p>

<p>37:8. For my loins are filled with illusions; and there isno health in<br>
my flesh.</p>

<p>37:9. I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning<br>
of my heart.</p>

<p>37:10. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden<br>
from thee.</p>

<p>37:11. My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of<br>
my eyes itself is not with me.</p>

<p>37:12. My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against<br>
me. And they that were near me stood afar off:</p>

<p>37:13. And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought<br>
evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.</p>

<p>37:14. But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening<br>
his mouth.</p>

<p>37:15. And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs<br>
in his mouth.</p>

<p>37:16. For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my<br>
God.</p>

<p>37:17. For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and<br>
whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.</p>

<p>37:18. For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before<br>
me.</p>

<p>37:19. For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think formy sin.</p>

<p>37:20. But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate<br>
me wrongfully are ultiplied.</p>

<p>37:21. They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I<br>
followed goodness.</p>

<p>37:22. For sake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me.</p>

<p>37:23. Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 38</p>

<p>Dixi custodiam.</p>

<p>A just man's peace and patience in his sufferings; considering the<br>
vanity of the world, and the providence of God.</p>

<p>38:1. Unto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David.</p>

<p>38:2. I said: I will take heed to my ways: that I sin not with my<br>
tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against<br>
me.</p>

<p>38:3. I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things:<br>
and my sorrow was renewed.</p>

<p>38:4. My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditqation a fire shall<br>
flame out.</p>

<p>38:5. I spoke with my tongue: O Lord, make me know my end. And what is<br>
the number of my days: that I may know what is wanting to me.</p>

<p>38:6. Behold thou hast made my days measurable and my substance is as<br>
nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vantiy: every man living.</p>

<p>38:7. Surely man passeth as an image: yea, and he is disquieted in vain.<br>
He storeth up: and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.</p>

<p>38:8. And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is<br>
with thee.</p>

<p>38:9. Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: thou hast made me a<br>
reproach to the fool.</p>

<p>38:10. I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.</p>

<p>38:11. Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made<br>
me faint in rebukes:</p>

<p>38:12. Thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul<br>
to waste away like a spider: surely in vain is any man disquieted.</p>

<p>38:13. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication: give ear to my<br>
tears. Be no silent: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as<br>
all my fathers were.</p>

<p>38:14. O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be<br>
no more.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 39</p>

<p>Expectans expectavi.</p>

<p>Christ's coming, and redeeming mankind.</p>

<p>39:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>39:2. With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive<br>
to me.</p>

<p>39:3. And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery<br>
and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my<br>
steps.</p>

<p>39:4. And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many<br>
shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.</p>

<p>39:5. Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who<br>
hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.</p>

<p>39:6. Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: and in<br>
thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have<br>
spoken they are multiplied above number.</p>

<p>39:7. Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast<br>
pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not<br>
require:</p>

<p>39:8. Then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written<br>
of me</p>

<p>39:9. That I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired it, and thy<br>
law in the midst of my heart.</p>

<p>39:10. I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not<br>
restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.</p>

<p>39:11. I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy<br>
truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth<br>
from a great council.</p>

<p>39:12. Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: thy mercy<br>
and thy truth have always upheld me.</p>

<p>39:13. For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have<br>
overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the<br>
hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me.</p>

<p>My iniquities... That is, the sins of all mankind, which I have taken<br>
upon me.</p>

<p>39:14. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me. Look down, O Lord, to help me.</p>

<p>39:15. Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my<br>
soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that<br>
desire evils to me.</p>

<p>39:16. Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: 'T is<br>
well, t' is well.</p>

<p>'T is well... The Hebrew here is an interjection of insult and derision,<br>
like the Vah. Matt. 27.49.</p>

<p>39:17. Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such<br>
as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.</p>

<p>39:18. But I am a beggar and poor: the Lord is careful for me. Thou art<br>
my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 40</p>

<p>Beatus qui intelligit.</p>

<p>The happiness of him that shall believe in Christ; notwithstanding the<br>
humility and poverty in which he shall come: the malice of his enemies,<br>
especially of the traitor Judas.</p>

<p>40:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>40:2. Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the<br>
poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.</p>

<p>40:3. The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon<br>
the earth: and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.</p>

<p>40:4. The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his<br>
couch in his sickness.</p>

<p>40:5. I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: heal my soul, for I have<br>
sinned against thee.</p>

<p>40:6. My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his<br>
name perish?</p>

<p>40:7. And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: his heart<br>
gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same<br>
purpose.</p>

<p>40:8. All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils<br>
to me.</p>

<p>40:9. They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth<br>
rise again no more?</p>

<p>40:10. For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my<br>
bread, hath greatly supplanted me.</p>

<p>40:11. But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise my up again: and I<br>
will requite them.</p>

<p>40:12. By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my<br>
enemy shall not rejoice over me.</p>

<p>40:13. But thou hast upheldme by reason of my innocence: and hast<br>
established me in thy sight for ever.</p>

<p>40:14. Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity.<br>
So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 41</p>

<p>Quemadmodum desiderat.</p>

<p>The fervent desire of the just after God: hope in afflictions.</p>

<p>41:1. Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>41:2. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul<br>
panteth after thee, O God.</p>

<p>41:3. My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I<br>
come and appear before the face of God?</p>

<p>41:4. My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me<br>
daily: Where is thy God?</p>

<p>41:5. These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: for I<br>
shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the<br>
house of God: With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one<br>
feasting.</p>

<p>41:6. Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in<br>
God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my<br>
countenance,</p>

<p>41:7. And my God. My soul is troubled within my self: therefore will I<br>
remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little<br>
hill.</p>

<p>41:8. Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy<br>
heights and thy billows have passed over me.</p>

<p>41:9. In the daytime the Lord hath commanded hismercy; and a canticle to<br>
him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life.</p>

<p>41:10. I will say to God: Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten<br>
me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?</p>

<p>41:11. Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who troubleme have<br>
reproached me; Whilst they say to me day be day: Where is thy God?</p>

<p>41:12. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?<br>
Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of<br>
my countenance, and my God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 42</p>

<p>Judica me, Deus.</p>

<p>The prophet aspireth after the temple and altar of God.</p>

<p>42:1. A psalm for David. Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from<br>
the nation that is not holy: deliver me from the unjust and deceitful<br>
man.</p>

<p>42:2. For thou art God my strrength: why hast thou cast me off? and why<br>
do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?</p>

<p>42:3. Sent forth thy light and thy truth: they have conducted me, and<br>
brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.</p>

<p>42:4. And I will go in to the altar of God: to God who giveth joy to my<br>
youth.</p>

<p>42:5. To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp: why art<br>
thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?</p>

<p>42:6. Hope in God, for I will still give pralise to him: the salvation<br>
of my countenance, and my God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 43</p>

<p>Deus auribus nostris.</p>

<p>The church commemorates former favours, and present afflictions; under<br>
which she prays for succour.</p>

<p>43:1. Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding.</p>

<p>43:2. We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to<br>
us, The work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.</p>

<p>43:3. Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou<br>
didst aflict the people and cast them out.</p>

<p>43:4. For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword:<br>
neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and<br>
the light of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased with them.</p>

<p>43:5. Thou art thyself my king andmy God, who commandest the saving of<br>
Jacob.</p>

<p>43:6. Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: and<br>
through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.</p>

<p>43:7. For I will not trust in my bow: neither shall my sword save me.</p>

<p>43:8. But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put<br>
them to shame that hate us.</p>

<p>43:9. In God shall we glory all the day long: and in thy name we will<br>
give praise for ever.</p>

<p>43:10. But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: and thou,<br>
O God, wilt not go out with our armies.</p>

<p>43:11. Thou hast made kus turn our back to our enemies: and they that<br>
hated us plundered for themselves.</p>

<p>43:12. Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: thou hast scattered<br>
us among the nations.</p>

<p>43:13. Thou hast sold thy people for no price: and there was no<br>
reckoning in the exchange of them.</p>

<p>43:14. Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and<br>
derision to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>43:15. Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: a shaking of the<br>
head among the people.</p>

<p>43:16. All the day long my shame is before me: and the confusion of my<br>
face hath covered me,</p>

<p>43:17. At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: at the<br>
face of the enemy and persecutor.</p>

<p>43:18. All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten<br>
thee: and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.</p>

<p>43:19. And our heart hath not turned back: neither hast thou turned<br>
aside our steps from thy way.</p>

<p>43:20. For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the<br>
shadow of death hath covered us.</p>

<p>43:21. If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread<br>
forth our hands to a strange god:</p>

<p>43:22. Shall not God search out thesethings: for he knoweth the secrets<br>
of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: we<br>
are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>

<p>43:23. Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to<br>
the end.</p>

<p>43:24. Why turnest thou thy face away? and forgettest our want and our<br>
trouble?</p>

<p>43:25. For our soul is humbled down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to<br>
the earth.</p>

<p>43:26. Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name's sake.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 44</p>

<p>Eructavit cor meum.</p>

in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.</p>

<p>44:4. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty.</p>

<p>44:5. With thy comeliness and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously,<br>
and reign. Because of truth and meekness and justice: and thy right hand<br>
shall conduct thee wonderfully.</p>

<p>44:6. Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, into the<br>
hearts of the king's enemies.</p>

<p>44:7. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom<br>
is a sceptre of uprightness.</p>

<p>44:8. Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy<br>
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>

<p>44:9. Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory<br>
houses: out of which</p>

<p>44:10. The daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory. The<br>
queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with<br>
variety.</p>

<p>44:11. Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: and forget thy<br>
people and thy father's house.</p>

<p>44:12. And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; for he is the Lord<br>
thy God, and him they shall adore.</p>

<p>44:13. And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, yea, all the rich among the<br>
people, shall entreat thy countenance.</p>

<p>44:14. All the glory of the king's daughter is within in golden borders,</p>

<p>44:15. Clothed round about with varieties. After her shall virgins be<br>
brought to the king: her neighbours shall be brought to thee.</p>

<p>44:16. They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: they shall be<br>
brought into the temple of the king.</p>

<p>44:17. Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: thou shalt make<br>
them princes over all the earth.</p>

<p>44:18. They shall remember thy name throughout all generations.<br>
Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 45</p>

<p>Deus noster refugium.</p>

<p>The church in persecution trusteth in the protection of God.</p>

<p>45:1. Unto the end, for the sons of Core, for the hidden.</p>

<p>45:2. Our God is our refuge and strength: a helper in troubles, which<br>
have found us exceedingly.</p>

<p>45:3. Therefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; and<br>
the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea.</p>

<p>45:4. Their waters roared and were troubled: the mountains were troubled<br>
with his strength.</p>

High hath sanctified his own tabernacle.</p>

it in the lmorning early.</p>

his voice, the earth trembled.</p>

done upon earth,</p>

destroy the bow, and break the weapons: and the shield he shall burn in<br>

the week.</p>

<p>47:2. Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of<br>
our God, in his holy mountain.</p>

<p>47:3. With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the<br>
sides of the north, the city of the great king.</p>

<p>47:4. In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.</p>

<p>47:5. For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they<br>
gathered together.</p>

<p>47:6. So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were<br>
moved:</p>

<p>47:7. Trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in<br>
labour.</p>

<p>47:8. With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of<br>
Tharsis.</p>

<p>47:9. As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of<br>
hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.</p>

<p>47:10. We have received thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>

<p>47:11. According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise kunto the<br>
ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of justice.</p>

<p>47:12. Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad;<br>
because of thy judgments, O Lord.</p>

<p>47:13. Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell lye in her towers.</p>

ye may relate it in another generation.</p>

<p>47:15. For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he<br>
shall rule us for evermore.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 48</p>

<p>Audite haec, omnes gentes.</p>

<p>The folly of worldlings, who live on in sin, without thinking of death<br>
or hell.</p>

<p>48:1. Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>48:2. Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of<br>
the world.</p>

<p>48:3. All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and<br>
poor together.</p>

<p>48:4. My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart<br>
understanding.</p>

<p>48:5. I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on<br>
the psaltery.</p>

<p>48:6. Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall<br>
encompass me.</p>

<p>The iniquity of my heel... That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or<br>
the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned<br>
and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the<br>
iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse<br>
is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or<br>
commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in<br>
the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils<br>
of hell shall find me?</p>

<p>48:7. They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude<br>
of their riches,</p>

<p>They that trust, etc... As much as to say, let them fear that trust in<br>
their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no<br>
brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or<br>
labour rescue them from death.</p>

<p>48:8. No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to<br>
God his ransom,</p>

<p>48:9. Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for<br>
ever,</p>

<p>And shall labour for ever, etc... This seems to be a continuation of the<br>
foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom<br>
prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live<br>
to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows,<br>
and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in<br>
sin.</p>

<p>48:10. And shall still live unto the end.</p>

<p>48:11. He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying:<br>
the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave<br>
their riches to strangers:</p>

<p>He shall not see destruction, etc... Or, shall he not see destruction?<br>
As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must<br>
not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt<br>
from dying.</p>

<p>48:12. And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their<br>
dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by<br>
their names.</p>

<p>They have called, etc... That is, they have left their names on their<br>
graves, which alone remain of their lands.</p>

<p>48:13. And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared<br>
to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.</p>

<p>48:14. This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards<br>
they shall delight in their mouth.</p>

<p>They shall delight in their mouth... Notwithstanding the wretched way in<br>
which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and<br>
glory in their doings.</p>

<p>48:15. They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And<br>
the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help<br>
shall decay in hell from their glory.</p>

<p>In the morning... That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the<br>
just shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid. From their glory... That<br>
is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no<br>
more.</p>

<p>48:16. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall<br>
receive me.</p>

<p>48:17. Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rick, and when the<br>
glory of his house shall be increased.</p>

<p>48:18. For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his<br>
glory descend with him.</p>

<p>48:19. For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise<br>
thee when thou shalt do well to him.</p>

<p>48:20. He shall g in to the gneerations of his fathers: and he shall<br>
never see light.</p>

<p>48:21. Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been<br>
compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 49</p>

<p>Deus deorum.</p>

<p>The coming of Christ: who prefers virtue and inward purity before the<br>
blood of victims.</p>

<p>49:1. A psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: and he<br>
hath called the earth. From the rising of the sun, to the going down<br>
thereof:</p>

<p>49:2. Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.</p>

<p>49:3. God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, and shall not keep<br>
silence. A fire shall burn before him: and a mighty tempest shall be<br>
round about him.</p>

<p>49:4. He shall call heraven from above, and the earth, to judge his<br>
people.</p>

<p>49:5. Gather ye together his saints to him: who set his covenant before<br>
sacrifices.</p>

<p>49:6. And the heavens shall declare his justice: for God is judge.</p>

<p>49:7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify<br>
to thee: I am God, thy God.</p>

<p>49:8. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: and thy burnt<br>
offerings are always in my sight.</p>

<p>49:9. I will not take calves out of thy house: nor he goats out of thy<br>
flocks.</p>

<p>49:10. For all the beasts of the woods are mine: the cattle on the<br>
hills, and the oxen.</p>

<p>49:11. I know all the fowls of the air: and with me is the beauty of the<br>
field.</p>

<p>49:12. If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is<br>
mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>

<p>49:13. Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of<br>
goats?</p>

<p>49:14. Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the<br>
most High.</p>

<p>49:15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and<br>
thou shalt glorify me.</p>

<p>49:16. But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my<br>
justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>

<p>49:17. Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind<br>
thee.</p>

<p>49:18. If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with<br>
adulterers thou hast been a partaker.</p>

<p>49:19. Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.</p>

<p>49:20. Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a<br>
scandal against thy mother's son:</p>

<p>49:21. These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest<br>
unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set<br>
before thy face.</p>

<p>49:22. Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you<br>
away, and there be none to deliver you.</p>

<p>49:23. The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way by<br>
which I will shew him the salvation of God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 50</p>

<p>Miserere.</p>

<p>The repentance and confession of David after his sin. The fourth<br>
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>50:1. Unto the end, a psalm of David,</p>

<p>50:2. When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had sinned with<br>
Bethsabee. [2 Kings 12.]</p>

<p>50:3. Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And<br>
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.</p>

<p>50:4. Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

<p>50:5. For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.</p>

<p>50:6. To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil befoer thee: that<br>
thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art<br>
judged.</p>

<p>50:7. For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my<br>
mother conceive me.</p>

<p>50:8. For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things<br>
of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.</p>

<p>50:9. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou<br>
shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.</p>

<p>50:10. To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: and the bones<br>
that have been humbled shall rejoice.</p>

<p>50:11. Tukrn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

<p>50:12. Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit<br>
within my bowels.</p>

<p>50:13. Cast me not away from thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from<br>
me.</p>

<p>50:14. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with<br>
a perfect spirit.</p>

<p>50:15. I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be<br>
converted to thee.</p>

<p>50:16. Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my<br>
tongue shall extol thy justice.</p>

<p>50:17. O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy<br>
praise.</p>

<p>50:18. For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given<br>
it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.</p>

<p>50:19. A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled<br>
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>

<p>50:20. Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; that the<br>
walls of Jerusalem may be built up.</p>

<p>50:21. Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and<br>
whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 51</p>

<p>Quid gloriaris.</p>

<p>David condemneth the wickedness of Doeg, and foretelleth his<br>
destruction.</p>

<p>51:1. Unto the end, understanding for David,</p>

<p>51:2. When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul: David went to the house<br>
of Achimelech.</p>

<p>51:3. Why dost thou glory in malice, thou that art mighty in iniquity?</p>

<p>51:4. All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: as a sharp<br>
razor, thou hast wrought deceit.</p>

<p>51:5. Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: and iniquity rather<br>
than to speak righteousness.</p>

<p>51:6. Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, O deceitful tongue.</p>

<p>51:7. Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: he will pluck thee out,<br>
and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of<br>
the living.</p>

<p>51:8. The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say:</p>

<p>51:9. Behold the man that made not God his helper: But trusted in the<br>
abundance of his riches: and prevailed in his vanity.</p>

<p>51:10. But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped<br>
in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.</p>

<p>51:11. I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I<br>
will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 52</p>

<p>Dixit insipiens.</p>

<p>The general corruption of man before the coming of Christ.</p>

<p>52:1. Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David. The fool said<br>
in his heart: There is no God.</p>

<p>Maeleth... Or Machalath. A musical instrument, or a chorus of musicians,<br>
for St. Jerome renders it, per chorum.</p>

<p>52:2. They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is<br>
none that doth good.</p>

<p>52:3. God looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if<br>
there were any that did understand, or did seek God.</p>

<p>52:4. All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable toegther, there<br>
is none that doth good, no not one.</p>

<p>52:5. Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people<br>
as they eat bread?</p>

<p>52:6. They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear,<br>
where there was no fear. For God hath scattered the bones of them that<br>
please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.</p>

<p>God hath scattered the bones, etc... That is, God has brought to nothing<br>
the strength of all those that seek to please men, to the prejudice of<br>
their duty to their Maker.</p>

<p>52:7. Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall<br>
bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel<br>
shall be glad.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 53</p>

<p>Deus, in nomine tuo.</p>

<p>A prayer for help in destress.</p>

<p>53:1. Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>

<p>
53:2. When the en of Ziph had come and said to Saul: Is not David hidden<br>
with us? [1 Kings 23.19]</p>

<p>53:3. Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.</p>

<p>53:4. O God, hear my lprayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>53:5. For strangers have rrisen up against me; and the mighty have<br>
sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.</p>

<p>53:6. For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my<br>
soul.</p>

<p>53:7. Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy<br>
truth.</p>

<p>53:8. I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to<br>
thy name: because it is good:</p>

<p>53:9. For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath<br>
looked down upon my enemies.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 54</p>

<p>Exaudi, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of a just man under persecution from the wicked. It agrees to<br>
Christ persecuted by the Jews, and betrayed by Judas.</p>

<p>54:1. Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>

<p>54:2. Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not lmy supplication:</p>

<p>54:3. Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and<br>
am troubled,</p>

<p>54:4. At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.<br>
For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were<br>
troublesome to me.</p>

<p>54:5. My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen<br>
upon me.</p>

<p>54:6. Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</p>

<p>54:7. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and<br>
be at rest?</p>

<p>54:8. Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the<br>
wilderness.</p>

<p>54:9. I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit,<br>
and a storm.</p>

<p>54:10. Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen<br>
iniquity and contradiction in the city.</p>

<p>54:11. Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in<br>
the midst thereof arelabour,</p>

<p>54:12. And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its<br>
streets.</p>

<p>54:13. For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with<br>
it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would<br>
perhaps have hidden my self from him.</p>

<p>54:14. But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,</p>

<p>54:15. Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God<br>
we walked with consent.</p>

<p>54:16. Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell.<br>
For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</p>

<p>Let death, etc... This, and such like imprecations which occur in the<br>
psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the<br>
punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and<br>
approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill will, or<br>
uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.</p>

<p>54:17. But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</p>

<p>54:18. Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he<br>
shall hear my voice.</p>

<p>54:19. He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me:<br>
for among many they were with me.</p>

<p>Among many, etc... That is, they that drew near to attack me were many<br>
in company all combined to fight against me.</p>

<p>54:20. God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is<br>
no change with them, and they have not feared God:</p>

<p>54:21. He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his<br>
covenant,</p>

<p>54:22. They are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart<br>
hath drawn near. His words are smoother tha oil, and the same are darts.</p>

<p>They are divided, etc... Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing,<br>
by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and<br>
deceitful ways.</p>

<p>54:23. Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall<br>
not suffer the just to waver for ever.</p>

<p>54:24. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of<br>
destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their<br>
days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 55</p>

<p>Miserere mei, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of David in danger and distress.</p>

<p>55:1. Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance form the<br>
sanctuary: for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when the<br>
Philistines held him in Geth.</p>

<p>55:2. Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all<br>
the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.</p>

<p>55:3. My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many<br>
that make war against me.</p>

<p>55:4. From the height of the day I shall fear: but I will trust in thee.</p>

<p>The height of the day... That is, even at noonday, when the sun is the<br>
highest, I am still in danger.</p>

<p>55:5. In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: I will<br>
not fear what flesh can do against me.</p>

<p>My words... The words or promises God has made in my favour.</p>

<p>55:6. All the day long they detested my words: all their thoughts were<br>
against me unto evil.</p>

<p>55:7. They will dwell and hide themselves: they will watch my heel. As<br>
they have waited for my soul,</p>

<p>55:8. For nothing shalt thou save them: in thy anger thou shalt break<br>
the people in pieces. O God,</p>

<p>For nothing shalt thou save them... That is, since they lie in wait to<br>
ruin my soul, thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them, but<br>
execute thy justice upon them.</p>

<p>55:9. I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set me tears in thy<br>
sight, As also in thy promise.</p>

<p>55:10. Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall<br>
call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.</p>

<p>55:11. In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his<br>
speech. In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.</p>

<p>55:12. In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will lpay, praises to<br>
thee:</p>

<p>55:13. Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from<br>
falling: that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the<br>
living.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 56</p>

<p>Miserere mei, Deus. The prophet prays in his affliction, and praises God<br>
for his delivery.</p>

<p>56:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a<br>
title, when he fled from Saul into the cave. [1 Kings 24.]</p>

<p>Destroy not... Suffer me not to be destroyed.</p>

<p>56:2. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in<br>
thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass<br>
away.</p>

<p>56:3. I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.</p>

<p>56:4. He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a<br>
reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,</p>

<p>56:5. And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I<br>
slept troubled. The sons ofmen, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and<br>
their tongue a sharp sword.</p>

<p>56:6. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all<br>
the earth.</p>

<p>56:7. They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul.<br>
They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.</p>

<p>56:8. My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and<br>
rehearse a psalm.</p>

<p>56:9. Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: I will arise early.</p>

<p>56:10. I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing<br>
a psalm to thee among the nations.</p>

<p>56:11. For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: and thy truth<br>
unto the clouds.</p>

<p>56:12. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above<br>
all the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 57</p>

<p>Si vere utique.</p>

<p>David reproveth the wicked, and foretelleth their punishment.</p>

<p>57:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a<br>
title.</p>

<p>57:2. If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of<br>
men.</p>

<p>57:3. For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in<br>
the earth.</p>

<p>57:4. The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from<br>
the womb: they have spoken false things.</p>

<p>57:5. Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the<br>
deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:</p>

<p>57:6. Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard<br>
that charmeth wisely.</p>

<p>57:7. God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord<br>
shall break the grinders of the lions.</p>

<p>57:8. They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent<br>
his bow till they be weakened.</p>

<p>57:9. Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: fire hath fallen<br>
on them, and they shall not see the sun.</p>

<p>57:10. Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up,<br>
as alive, in his wrath.</p>

<p>Before your thorns, etc... That is, before your thorns grow up, so as to<br>
become strong briers, they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine<br>
justice, swallowing them up, as it were, alive in his wrath.</p>

<p>57:11. The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: he shall<br>
wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.</p>

<p>Shall wash his hands, etc... Shall applaud the justice of God, and take<br>
occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash<br>
and cleanse his hands from sin.</p>

<p>57:12. And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: there is<br>
indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 58</p>

<p>Eripe me.</p>

<p>A prayer to be delivered from the wicked, with confidence in God's help<br>
and protection. It agrees to Christ and his enemies the Jews.</p>

<p>58:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David for an inscription of a<br>
title, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him. [1 Kings 19.]</p>

<p>58:2. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; and defend me from them that<br>
rise up against me.</p>

<p>58:3. Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody<br>
men.</p>

<p>58:4. For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in<br>
upon me:</p>

<p>58:5. Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity<br>
have I ren, and directed my steps.</p>

<p>58:6. Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of<br>
hosts, the God of Israel. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy<br>
on all them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>58:7. They shall return at everning, and shall suffer hunger like dogs:<br>
and shall go round about the city.</p>

<p>58:8. Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their<br>
lips: for who, say they, hath heard us?</p>

<p>58:9. But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: thou shalt bring all the<br>
nations to nothing.</p>

<p>58:10. I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector:</p>

<p>58:11. My God, his mercy shall prevent me.</p>

<p>58:12. God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, lest at any<br>
time my people forget. Scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O<br>
Lord, my protector:</p>

<p>58:13. For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: and let<br>
them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall<br>
be talked of,</p>

<p>58:14. When they are consumed: when they are consumed by thy wrath, and<br>
they shall be no more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and<br>
all the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>58:15. They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs:<br>
and shall go round about the city.</p>

<p>58:16. They shall be scattered abroad to eat, and shall murmur if they<br>
be not filled.</p>

<p>58:17. But I will sing thy strength: and will extol thy mercy in the<br>
morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my<br>
trouble.</p>

<p>58:18. Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence:<br>
my God my mercy.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 59</p>

<p>Deus, repulisti nos.</p>

<p>After many afflictions, the church of Christ shall prevail.</p>

<p>59:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the inscription<br>
of a title, to David himself, for doctrine,</p>

<p>59:2. When he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal: and Joab<br>
returned and slew of Edom, in the vale of the saltpits, twelve thousand<br>
men.</p>

<p>59:3. O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; thou hast<br>
been angry, and hast had mercy on us.</p>

<p>59:4. Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it: heal thou the<br>
breaches thereof, for it has been moved.</p>

<p>59:5. Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us drink<br>
the wine of sorrow.</p>

<p>59:6. Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: that they may<br>
flee from before the bow: That thy beloved may be delivered.</p>

<p>59:7. Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>

<p>59:8. God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will<br>
divide Sichem; and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.</p>

<p>59:9. Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength<br>
of my head. Juda is my king:</p>

<p>59:10. Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe:<br>
to me the foreigners are made subject.</p>

<p>The pot of my hope... Or my watering pot. That is, a vessel for meaner<br>
uses, by being reduced to serve me, even in the meanest employments.<br>
Ibid. Foreigners... So the Philistines are called, who had no kindred<br>
with the Israelites; whereas the Edomites, Moabites, etc., were<br>
originally of the same family.</p>

<p>59:11. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into<br>
Edom?</p>

<p>59:12. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O<br>
God, go out with our armies?</p>

<p>59:13. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the salvation of man.</p>

<p>59:14. Through God we shall do mightily: and he shall bring to nothing<br>
them that afflict us.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 60</p>

<p>Exaudi, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer for the coming of the kingdom of Christ, which shall have no<br>
end.</p>

<p>60:1. Unto the end, in hymns, for David.</p>

<p>60:2. Hear, O God, my supplication: be attentive to my prayer.</p>

<p>60:3. To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth: when my heart was<br>
in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me;</p>

<p>60:4. For thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face<br>
of the enemy.</p>

<p>60:5. In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever: I shall be protected<br>
under the covert of thy wings.</p>

<p>60:6. For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer: thou hast given an<br>
inheritance to them that fear thy name.</p>

<p>60:7. Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years even to<br>
generation and generation.</p>

<p>60:8. He abideth for ever in the sight of God: his mercy and truth who<br>
shall search?</p>

<p>60:9. So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever: that I may<br>
pay my vows from day to day.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 61</p>

<p>Nonne Deo.</p>

<p>The prophet encourageth himself and all others to trust in God, and<br>
serve him.</p>

<p>61:1. Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>61:2. Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.</p>

<p>61:3. For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be<br>
moved no more.</p>

<p>61:4. How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were<br>
thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.</p>

<p>61:5. But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they<br>
blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.</p>

<p>61:6. But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my<br>
patience.</p>

<p>61:7. For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be<br>
moved.</p>

<p>61:8. In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and<br>
my hope is in God.</p>

<p>61:9. Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts<br>
before him. God is our helper for ever.</p>

<p>61:10. But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the<br>
balances: that by vanity they may together deceive.</p>

<p>Are liars in the balances, etc... They are so vain and light, that if<br>
they are put into the scales, they will be found to be of no weight; and<br>
to be mere lies, deceit, and vanity. Or, They are liars in their<br>
balances, by weighing things by false weights, and preferring the<br>
temporal before the eternal.</p>

<p>61:11. Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies: if riches abound,<br>
set not your heart upon them.</p>

<p>61:12. God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power<br>
belongeth to God,</p>

<p>61:13. And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man<br>
according to his works.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 62</p>

<p>Deus Deus meus, ad te.</p>

<p>The prophet aspireth after God.</p>

<p>62:1. A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.</p>

<p>62:2. O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my<br>
soul hath thirsted; for thee my flesh, O how many ways!</p>

<p>62:3. In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in<br>
the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.</p>

<p>62:4. For thy mercy is better than lives: thee my lips will praise.</p>

<p>62:5. Thus will I bless thee all my life long: and in thy name I will<br>
lift up my hands.</p>

<p>62:6. Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth<br>
shall praise thee with joyful lips.</p>

<p>62:7. If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in<br>
the morning:</p>

<p>62:8. Because thou hast been my helper. And I will rejoice under the<br>
covert of thy wings:</p>

<p>62:9. My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me.</p>

<p>62:10. But they have fought my soul in vain, they shall go into the<br>
lower parts of the earth:</p>

<p>62:11. They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall<br>
be the portions of foxes.</p>

<p>62:12. But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that<br>
swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked<br>
things.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 63</p>

<p>Exaudi Deus orationem.</p>

<p>A prayer in affliction, with confidence in God that he will bring to<br>
nought the machinations of persecutors.</p>

<p>63:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>63:2. Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver<br>
my soul from the fear of the enemy.</p>

<p>63:3. Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from<br>
the multitude of the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>63:4. For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent<br>
their bow a bitter thing,</p>

<p>63:5. To shoot in secret the undefiled.</p>

<p>63:6. They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are<br>
resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have<br>
said: Who shall see them?</p>

<p>63:7. They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their<br>
search. Man shall come to a deep heart:</p>

<p>A deep heart... That is, crafty, subtle, deep projects and designs;<br>
which nevertheless shall not succeed; for God shall be exalted in<br>
bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power.</p>

<p>63:8. And God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:</p>

<p>The arrows of children are their wounds... That is, the wounds, stripes,<br>
or blows, they seek to inflict upon the just, are but like the weak<br>
efforts of children's arrows, which can do no execution: and their<br>
tongues, that is, their speeches against them come to nothing.</p>

<p>63:9. And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them<br>
were troubled;</p>

<p>63:10. And every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God, and<br>
understood his doings.</p>

<p>63:11. The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and<br>
all the upright in heart shall be praised.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 64</p>

<p>Te decet.</p>

<p>God is to be praised in his church, to which all nations shall be<br>
called.</p>

<p>
64:1. To the end, a psalm of David. The canticle of Jeremias and<br>
Ezechiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go out.</p>

<p>Of the captivity... That is, the people of the captivity of Babylon.<br>
This is not in the Hebrew, but is found in the ancient translation of<br>
the Septuagint.</p>

<p>64:2. A hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be paid to<br>
thee in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>64:3. O hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.</p>

<p>64:4. The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: and thou wilt<br>
pardon our transgressions.</p>

<p>64:5. Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: he shall<br>
dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy<br>
house; holy is thy temple,</p>

<p>64:6. Wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the hope<br>
of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.</p>

<p>64:7. Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded<br>
with power:</p>

<p>64:8. Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The<br>
Gentiles shall be troubled,</p>

<p>64:9. And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at<br>
thy signs: thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the<br>
evening to be joyful.</p>

<p>64:10. Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it;<br>
thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water,<br>
thou hast prepared their food: for so is its preparation.</p>

<p>64:11. Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, multiply its fruits; it<br>
shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.</p>

<p>64:12. Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness: and thy<br>
fields shall be filled with plenty.</p>

<p>64:13. The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat: and the<br>
hills shall be girded about with joy,</p>

<p>64:14. The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound<br>
with corn: they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 65</p>

<p>Jubilate Deo.</p>

<p>An invitation to praise God.</p>

<p>65:1. Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection. Shout<br>
with joy to God, all the earth,</p>

<p>65:2. Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.</p>

<p>65:3. Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude<br>
of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.</p>

<p>65:4. Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a<br>
psalm to thy name.</p>

<p>65:5. Come and see the works of God; who is terrible in his counsels<br>
over the sons of men.</p>

<p>65:6. Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on<br>
foot: there shall we rejoice in him.</p>

<p>65:7. Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let<br>
not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.</p>

<p>65:8. O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to<br>
be heard.</p>

<p>65:9. Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be<br>
moved:</p>

<p>65:10. For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as<br>
silver is tried.</p>

<p>65:11. Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on<br>
our back:</p>

<p>65:12. Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and<br>
water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.</p>

<p>65:13. I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my<br>
vows,</p>

<p>65:14. Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was<br>
in trouble.</p>

<p>65:15. I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt<br>
offerings of rams: I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.</p>

<p>65:16. Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what<br>
great things he hath done for my soul.</p>

<p>65:17. I cried to him with my mouth: and I extolled him with my tongue.</p>

<p>65:18. If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear<br>
me.</p>

<p>65:19. Therefore hath God heard me, and hath attended to the voice of my<br>
supplication.</p>

<p>65:20. Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy<br>
from me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 66</p>

<p>Deus misereatur.</p>

<p>A prayer for the propagation of the church.</p>

<p>66:1. Unto the end, in hymns, a psalm of a canticle for David.</p>

<p>66:2. May God have mercy on us, and bless us: may he cause the light of<br>
his countenance to shine upon us, and may he have mercy on us.</p>

<p>66:3. That we may know thy way upon earth: thy salvation in all nations.</p>

<p>66:4. Let people confess to thee, O God: let all people give praise to<br>
thee.</p>

<p>66:5. Let the nations be glad and rejoice: for thou judgest the people<br>
with justice, and directest the nations upon earth.</p>

<p>66:6. Let the people, O God, confess to thee: let all the people give<br>
praise to thee:</p>

<p>66:7. The earth hath yielded her fruit. May God, our God bless us,</p>

<p>66:8. May God bless us: and all the ends of the earth fear him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 67</p>

<p>Exurgat Deus.</p>

<p>The glorious establishment of the church of the New Testament,<br>
prefigured by the benefits bestowed on the people of Israel.</p>

<p>67:1. Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself.</p>

<p>67:2. Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: and let them that<br>
hate him flee from before his face.</p>

<p>67:3. As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before<br>
the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>

<p>67:4. And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted<br>
with gladness.</p>

<p>67:5. Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who<br>
ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him:<br>
but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence,</p>

<p>Who ascendeth upon the west... Super occasum. St. Gregory understands it<br>
of Christ, who after his going down, like the sun, in the west, by his<br>
passion and death, ascended more glorious, and carried all before him.<br>
St. Jerome renders it, who ascendeth, or cometh up, through the deserts.</p>

<p>67:6. Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his<br>
holy place:</p>

<p>67:7. God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth<br>
out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke,<br>
that dwell in sepulchres.</p>

<p>Of one manner... That is, agreeing in faith, unanimous in love, and<br>
following the same manner of discipline. It is verified in the servants<br>
of God, living together in his house, which is the church. 1 Tim. 3.15.<br>
Ibid. Them that were bound, etc... The power and mercy of God appears in<br>
his bringing out of their captivity those that were strongly bound in<br>
their sins: and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been<br>
most provoking; and who by their evil habits were not only dead, but<br>
buried in their sepulchres.</p>

<p>67:8. O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when<br>
thou didst pass through the desert:</p>

<p>67:9. The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of<br>
the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.</p>

<p>67:10. Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and<br>
it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.</p>

<p>A free rain... the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in<br>
favour of God's inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was<br>
weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by<br>
God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on<br>
to the promised land. It agrees particularly to the church of Christ his<br>
true inheritance, which is plentifully watered with the free rain of<br>
heavenly grace; and through many infirmities, that is, crosses and<br>
tribulations, is made perfect, and fitted for eternal glory.</p>

<p>67:11. In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast<br>
provided for the poor.</p>

<p>In it, etc... That is, in this church, which is thy fold and thy<br>
inheritance, shall thy animals, thy sheep, dwell: where thou hast<br>
plentifully provided for them.</p>

<p>67:12. The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings<br>
with great power.</p>

<p>To them that preach good tidings... Evangelizantibus. That is, to the<br>
preachers of the gospel; who receiving the word from the Lord, shall<br>
with great power and efficacy preach throughout the world the glad<br>
tidings of a Saviour, and of eternal salvation through him.</p>

<p>67:13. The king of powers is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the<br>
beauty of the house shall divide spoils.</p>

<p>The king of powers... That is, the mighty King, the Lord of hosts, is of<br>
the beloved, of the beloved; that is, is on the side of Christ, his most<br>
beloved son: and his beautiful house, viz., the church, in which God<br>
dwells forever, shall by her spiritual conquests divide the spoils of<br>
many nations. The Hebrew (as it now stands pointed) is thus rendered,<br>
The kings of armies have fled, they have fled, and she that dwells at<br>
home (or the beauty of the house) shall divide the spoils.</p>

<p>67:14. If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings<br>
of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the<br>
paleness of gold.</p>

<p>If you sleep among the midst of lots (intermedios cleros, etc.)... Viz.,<br>
in such dangers and persecutions, as if your enemies were casting lots<br>
for your goods and persons: or in the midst of the lots, (intermedios<br>
terminos, as St. Jerome renders it,) that is, upon the very bounds or<br>
borders of the dominions of your enemies: you shall be secure<br>
nevertheless under the divine protection; and shall be enabled to fly<br>
away, like a dove, with glittering wings and feathers shining like the<br>
palest and most precious gold; that is, with great increase of virtue,<br>
and glowing with the fervour of charity.</p>

<p>67:15. When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall<br>
be whited with snow in Selmon.</p>

<p>Kings over her... That is, pastors and rulers over his church, viz., the<br>
apostles and their successors. Then by their ministry shall men be made<br>
whiter than the snow which lies on the top of the high mountain Selmon.</p>

<p>67:16. The mountain of God is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat<br>
mountain.</p>

<p>The mountain of God... The church, which, Isa. 2.2, is called The<br>
mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains. It is here<br>
called a fat and a curdled mountain; that is to say, most fruitful, and<br>
enriched by the spiritual gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>67:17. Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is<br>
well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.</p>

<p>Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?... Why do you suppose or imagine<br>
there may be any other such curdled mountains? You are mistaken: the<br>
mountain thus favoured by God is but one; and this same he has chosen<br>
for his dwelling for ever.</p>

<p>67:18. The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of<br>
them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place.</p>

<p>The chariot of God... Descending to give his law on mount Sina: as also<br>
of Jesus Christ his Son, ascending into heaven, to send from thence the<br>
Holy Ghost, to publish his new law, is attended with ten thousands, that<br>
is, with an innumerable multitude of joyful angels.</p>

<p>67:19. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou<br>
hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the<br>
dwelling of the Lord God.</p>

<p>Led captivity captive... Carrying away with thee to heaven those who<br>
before had been the captives of Satan; and receiving from God the Father<br>
gifts to be distributed to men; even to those who were before<br>
unbelievers.</p>

<p>67:20. Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will<br>
make our journey prosperous to us.</p>

<p>67:21. Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are<br>
the issues from death.</p>

<p>The issues from death... The Lord alone is master of the issues, by<br>
which we may escape from death.</p>

<p>67:22. But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of<br>
them that walk on in their sins.</p>

<p>67:23. The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, I will turn them into<br>
the depth of the sea:</p>

<p>I will turn them from Basan, etc... I will cast out my enemies from<br>
their rich possessions, signified by Basan, a fruitful country; and I<br>
will drive them into the depth of the sea: and make such a slaughter of<br>
them, that the feet of my servants may be dyed in their blood, etc.</p>

<p>67:24. That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the<br>
tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.</p>

<p>67:25. They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my<br>
king who is in his sanctuary.</p>

<p>Thy goings... Thy ways, thy proceedings, by which thou didst formerly<br>
take possession of the promised land in favour of thy people; and shalt<br>
afterwards of the whole world, which thou shalt subdue to thy Son.</p>

<p>67:26. Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young<br>
damsels playing on timbrels.</p>

<p>Princes... The apostles, the first converters of nations; attended by<br>
numbers of perfect souls, singing the divine praises, and virgins<br>
consecrated to God.</p>

<p>67:27. In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of<br>
Israel.</p>

<p>From the fountains of Israel... From whom both Christ and his apostles<br>
sprung. By Benjamin, the holy fathers on this place understand St. Paul,<br>
who was of that tribe, named here a youth, because he was the last<br>
called to the apostleship. By the princes of Juda, Zabulon, and<br>
Nephthali, we may understand the other apostles, who were of the tribe<br>
of Juda; or of the tribes of Zabulon, and Nephthali, where our Lord<br>
began to preach, Matt. 4.13, etc.</p>

<p>67:28. There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of<br>
Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of<br>
Nephthali.</p>

<p>67:29. Command thy strength, O God confirm, O God, what thou hast<br>
wrought in us.</p>

<p>Command thy strength.. Give orders that thy strength may be always with<br>
us.</p>

<p>67:30. From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.</p>

<p>67:31. Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls<br>
with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with<br>
silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars:</p>

<p>Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds... or the wild beasts, which lie hid<br>
in the reeds. That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to<br>
surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors,<br>
who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds,<br>
which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of<br>
the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from<br>
their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine,<br>
that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ<br>
and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried<br>
by fire.</p>

<p>67:32. Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch<br>
out her hands to God.</p>

<p>Ambassadors shall come, etc... It is a prophecy of the conversion of the<br>
Gentiles, and by name of the Egyptians and Ethiopians.</p>

<p>67:33. Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing ye to the Lord: Sing<br>
ye to God,</p>

<p>67:34. Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east. Behold he<br>
will give to his voice the voice of power:</p>

<p>To the east... From mount Olivet, which is on the east side of<br>
Jerusalem.-Ibid. The voice of power... That is, he will make his voice<br>
to be a powerful voice: by calling from death to life, such as were dead<br>
in mortal sin: as at the last day he will by the power of his voice call<br>
all the dead from their graves.</p>

<p>67:35. Give ye glory to God for Israel, his magnificence, and his power<br>
is in the clouds.</p>

<p>67:36. God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will<br>
give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 68</p>

<p>Salvum me fac, Deus.</p>

<p>Christ in his passion declareth the greatness of his sufferings, and the<br>
malice of his persecutors the Jews; and foretelleth their reprobation.</p>

<p>68:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David.</p>

<p>For them that shall be changed... A psalm for Christian converts, to<br>
remember the passion of Christ.</p>

<p>68:2. Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.</p>

<p>The waters... Of afflictions and sorrows. My soul is sorrowful even unto<br>
death. Matt. 26.38.</p>

<p>68:3. I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure<br>
standing. I am come into the depth of the sea, and a tempest hath<br>
overwhelmed me.</p>

<p>68:4. I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse, my eyes<br>
have failed, whilst I hope in my God.</p>

<p>68:5. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me<br>
without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully<br>
persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.</p>

<p>I pay that which I took not away... Christ in his passion made<br>
restitution of what he had not taken away, by suffering the punishment<br>
due to our sins, and so repairing the injury we had done to God.</p>

<p>68:6. O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden<br>
from thee:</p>

<p>My foolishness and my offences... which my enemies impute to me: or the<br>
follies and sins of men, which I have taken upon myself.</p>

<p>68:7. Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the<br>
Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee,<br>
O God of Israel.</p>

<p>68:8. Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my<br>
face.</p>

<p>68:9. I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of<br>
my mother.</p>

<p>68:10. For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of<br>
them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>68:11. And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to<br>
me.</p>

<p>68:12. And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.</p>

<p>68:13. They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank<br>
wine made me their song.</p>

<p>68:14. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy<br>
good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the<br>
truth of thy salvation.</p>

<p>68:15. Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me<br>
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

<p>68:16. Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep water swallow<br>
me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>

<p>68:17. Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to<br>
the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>

<p>68:18. And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble,<br>
hear me speedily.</p>

<p>68:19. Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.</p>

<p>68:20. Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.</p>

<p>68:21. In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected<br>
reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together<br>
with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I<br>
found none.</p>

<p>68:22. And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me<br>
vinegar to drink.</p>

<p>68:23. Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense,<br>
and a stumblingblock.</p>

<p>Let their table, etc... What here follows in the style of an<br>
imprecation, is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the Jews<br>
should be reduced in punishment of their wilful obstinacy.</p>

<p>68:24. Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend<br>
thou down always.</p>

<p>68:25. Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger<br>
take hold of them.</p>

<p>68:26. Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to<br>
dwell in their tabernacles.</p>

<p>68:27. Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they<br>
have added to the grief of my wounds.</p>

<p>68:28. Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into<br>
thy justice.</p>

<p>68:29. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the<br>
just let them not be written.</p>

<p>68:30. But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me<br>
up.</p>

<p>68:31. I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify<br>
him with praise.</p>

<p>68:32. And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth<br>
forth horns and hoofs.</p>

<p>68:33. Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall<br>
live.</p>

<p>68:34. For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his<br>
prisoners.</p>

<p>68:35. Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every<br>
thing that creepeth therein.</p>

<p>68:36. For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up.<br>
And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.</p>

<p>Sion... The catholic church. The cities of Juda, etc., her places of<br>
worship, which shall be established throughout the world. And there,<br>
viz., in this church of Christ, shall his servants dwell, etc.</p>

<p>68:37. And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love<br>
his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 69</p>

<p>Deus in adjutorium.</p>

<p>A prayer in persecution.</p>

<p>69:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the<br>
Lord saved him.</p>

<p>69:2. O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.</p>

<p>69:3. Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:</p>

<p>69:4. Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils<br>
to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to<br>
me: 'Tis well, 'tis well.</p>

<p>'T is well, 't is well... Euge, euge. St. Jerome renders it, vah, vah!<br>
which is the voice of one insulting and deriding. Some understand it as<br>
a detestation of deceitful flatterers.</p>

<p>69:5. Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such<br>
as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.</p>

<p>69:6. But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my<br>
deliverer: O lord, make no delay.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 70</p>

<p>In te, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer for perseverance.</p>

<p>70:1. A psalm for David. Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former<br>
captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to<br>
confusion:</p>

<p>Of the sons of Jonadab... The Rechabites, of whom see Jer. 35. By this<br>
addition of the seventy-two interpreters, we gather that this psalm was<br>
usually sung in the synagogue, in the person of the Rechabites, and of<br>
those who were first carried away into captivity.</p>

<p>70:2. Deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me. Incline thy ear unto me,<br>
and save me.</p>

<p>70:3. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: that<br>
thou mayst make me safe. For thou art my firmament and my refuge.</p>

<p>70:4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of<br>
the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.</p>

<p>70:5. For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth.</p>

<p>70:6. By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother's womb<br>
thou art my protector. Of thee I shall continually sing:</p>

<p>70:7. I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.</p>

<p>70:8. Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy<br>
greatness all the day long.</p>

<p>70:9. Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall<br>
fail, do not thou forsake me.</p>

<p>70:10. For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my<br>
soul have consulted together,</p>

<p>70:11. Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is<br>
none to deliver him.</p>

<p>70:12. O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help.</p>

<p>70:13. Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul;<br>
let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt.</p>

<p>70:14. But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.</p>

<p>70:15. My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day<br>
long. Because I have not known learning,</p>

<p>Learning... As much as to say, I build not upon human learning, but only<br>
on the power and justice of God.</p>

<p>70:16. I will enter into the powers of the Lord: O Lord, I will be<br>
mindful of thy justice alone.</p>

<p>70:17. Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: and till now I will<br>
declare thy wonderful works.</p>

<p>70:18. And unto old age and grey hairs: O God, forsake me not, Until I<br>
shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come: Thy power,</p>

<p>70:19. And thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou<br>
hast done: O God, who is like to thee?</p>

<p>70:20. How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and<br>
turning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again<br>
from the depths of the earth:</p>

<p>70:21. Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou<br>
hast comforted me.</p>

<p>70:22. For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of<br>
psaltery: O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of<br>
Israel.</p>

<p>70:23. My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my<br>
soul which thou hast redeemed.</p>

<p>70:24. Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; when<br>
they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 71</p>

<p>Deus, judicium tuum.</p>

<p>A prophecy of the coming of Christ, and of his kingdom: prefigured by<br>
Solomon and his happy reign.</p>

<p>71:1. A psalm on Solomon.</p>

<p>71:2. Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king's son thy<br>
justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.</p>

<p>71:3. Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the hills<br>
justice.</p>

<p>71:4. He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the<br>
children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.</p>

<p>71:5. And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon, throughout<br>
all generations.</p>

<p>71:6. He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers<br>
falling gently upon the earth.</p>

<p>71:7. In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, till<br>
the moon be taken away.</p>

<p>71:8. And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the<br>
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>71:9. Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall<br>
lick the ground.</p>

<p>71:10. The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the<br>
kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:</p>

<p>71:11. And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall<br>
serve him.</p>

<p>71:12. For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that<br>
had no helper.</p>

<p>71:13. He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of<br>
the poor.</p>

<p>71:14. He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their<br>
names shall be honourable in his sight.</p>

<p>71:15. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of<br>
Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the<br>
day.</p>

<p>71:16. And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of<br>
mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of<br>
the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.</p>

<p>A firmament on the earth, etc... This may be understood of the church of<br>
Christ, ever firm and visible: and of the flourishing condition of its<br>
congregation.</p>

<p>71:17. Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before<br>
the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all<br>
nations shall magnify him.</p>

<p>71:18. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful<br>
things.</p>

<p>71:19. And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole<br>
earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>71:20. The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.</p>

<p>Are ended... By this it appears that this psalm, though placed here, was<br>
in order of time the last of those which David composed.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 72</p>

<p>Quam bonus Israel Deus.</p>

<p>The temptation of the weak, upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked, is<br>
overcome by the consideration of the justice of God, who will quickly<br>
render to every one according to his works.</p>

<p>72:1. A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of<br>
a right heart!</p>

<p>72:2. But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>

<p>72:3. Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the<br>
prosperity of sinners.</p>

<p>72:4. For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in<br>
their stripes.</p>

<p>72:5. They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged<br>
like other men.</p>

<p>72:6. Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their<br>
iniquity and their wickedness.</p>

<p>72:7. Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have<br>
passed into the affection of the heart.</p>

<p>Fatness... Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them<br>
in their iniquity: and made them give themselves up to their irregular<br>
affections.</p>

<p>72:8. They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity<br>
on high.</p>

<p>72:9. They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath<br>
passed through the earth.</p>

<p>72:10. Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found<br>
in them.</p>

<p>Return here... or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be<br>
apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they<br>
consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the<br>
wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence<br>
which are set down in the following verses.</p>

<p>72:11. And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the<br>
most High?</p>

<p>72:12. Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they<br>
have obtained riches.</p>

<p>72:13. And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my<br>
hands among the innocent.</p>

<p>72:14. And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath<br>
been in the mornings.</p>

<p>72:15. If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the<br>
generation of thy children.</p>

<p>If I said, etc... That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.</p>

<p>72:16. I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my<br>
sight:</p>

<p>72:17. Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning<br>
their last ends.</p>

<p>72:18. But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were<br>
lifted up thou hast cast them down.</p>

<p>Thou hast put it to them... In punishment of their deceits, or for<br>
deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end,<br>
which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.</p>

<p>72:19. How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to<br>
be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.</p>

<p>72:20. As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou<br>
shalt bring their image to nothing.</p>

<p>72:21. For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:</p>

<p>72:22. And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.</p>

<p>72:23. I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.</p>

<p>72:24. Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast<br>
conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.</p>

<p>72:25. For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon<br>
earth?</p>

<p>72:26. For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the<br>
God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.</p>

<p>72:27. For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast<br>
destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.</p>

<p>72:28. But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the<br>
Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the<br>
daughter of Sion.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 73</p>

<p>Ut quid, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions.</p>

<p>73:1. Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the<br>
end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>

<p>73:2. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the<br>
beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed:<br>
mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.</p>

<p>73:3. Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what<br>
things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>73:4. And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of<br>
thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs,</p>

<p>Their ensigns, etc... They have fixed their colours for signs and<br>
trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple: and<br>
they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place.<br>
This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the<br>
profanation of the temple by Antiochus.</p>

<p>73:5. And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As<br>
with axes in a wood of trees,</p>

<p>73:6. They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet<br>
they have brought it down.</p>

<p>73:7. They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the<br>
dwelling place of thy name on the earth.</p>

<p>73:8. They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let<br>
us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.</p>

<p>73:9. Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will<br>
know us no more.</p>

<p>73:10. How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to<br>
provoke thy name for ever?</p>

<p>73:11. Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the<br>
midst of thy bosom for ever?</p>

<p>73:12. But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the<br>
midst of the earth.</p>

<p>73:13. Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush<br>
the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

<p>The sea firm... By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm<br>
walls, whilst Israel passed through: and destroying the Egyptians called<br>
here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king:<br>
casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians<br>
inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.</p>

<p>73:14. Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to<br>
be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.</p>

<p>73:15. Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast<br>
dried up the Ethan rivers.</p>

<p>Ethan rivers... That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was<br>
verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21.14.</p>

<p>73:16. Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the<br>
morning light and the sun.</p>

<p>73:17. Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the<br>
spring were formed by thee.</p>

<p>73:18. Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish<br>
people hath provoked thy name.</p>

<p>73:19. Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and<br>
forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.</p>

<p>73:20. Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the<br>
earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.</p>

<p>The obscure of the earth... Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled,<br>
that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates<br>
and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.</p>

<p>73:21. Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and<br>
needy shall praise thy name.</p>

<p>73:22. Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with<br>
which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.</p>

<p>73:23. Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate<br>
thee ascendeth continually.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 74</p>

<p>Confitebimur tibi.</p>

<p>There is a just judgment to come: therefore let the wicked take care.</p>

<p>74:1. Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph.</p>

<p>Corrupt not... It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or<br>
hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung. St. Augustine and<br>
other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to<br>
faint or fail in our hope: but to persevere with constancy in good:<br>
because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man<br>
according to his works.</p>

<p>74:2. We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon<br>
thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:</p>

<p>74:3. When I shall take a time, I will judge justices.</p>

<p>When I shall take a time... In proper times: particularly at the last<br>
day, when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge:<br>
the same who originally laid the foundations of it, and as it were<br>
established its pillars.</p>

<p>74:4. The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have<br>
established the pillars thereof.</p>

<p>74:5. I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners:<br>
Lift not up the horn.</p>

<p>74:6. Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.</p>

<p>74:7. For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert<br>
hills:</p>

<p>74:8. For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth<br>
up:</p>

<p>74:9. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of<br>
mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs<br>
thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.</p>

<p>74:10. But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>74:11. And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the<br>
just shall be exalted.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 75</p>

<p>Notus in Judaea.</p>

<p>God is known in his church: and exerts his power in protecting it. It<br>
alludes to the slaughter of the Assyrians, in the days of king Ezechias.</p>

<p>75:1. Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the<br>
Assyrians.</p>

<p>75:2. In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.</p>

<p>75:3. And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:</p>

<p>75:4. There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword,<br>
and the battle.</p>

<p>75:5. Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.</p>

<p>75:6. All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their<br>
sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.</p>

<p>75:7. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that<br>
mounted on horseback.</p>

<p>75:8. Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy<br>
wrath.</p>

<p>From that time, etc... From the time that thy wrath shall break out.</p>

<p>75:9. Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth<br>
trembled and was still,</p>

<p>75:10. When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.</p>

<p>75:11. For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the<br>
remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.</p>

<p>75:12. Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round<br>
about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,</p>

<p>75:13. Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the<br>
terrible with the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 76</p>

<p>Voce mea.</p>

<p>The faithful have recourse to God in trouble of mind, with confidence in<br>
his mercy and power.</p>

<p>76:1. Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>76:2. I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he<br>
gave ear to me.</p>

<p>76:3. In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to<br>
him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be<br>
comforted:</p>

<p>76:4. I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my<br>
spirit swooned away.</p>

<p>76:5. My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.</p>

<p>76:6. I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal<br>
years.</p>

<p>76:7. And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was<br>
exercised and I swept my spirit.</p>

<p>76:8. Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more<br>
favourable again?</p>

<p>76:9. Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to<br>
generation?</p>

<p>76:10. Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up<br>
his mercies?</p>

<p>76:11. And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right<br>
hand of the most High.</p>

<p>76:12. I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy<br>
wonders from the beginning.</p>

<p>76:13. And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy<br>
inventions.</p>

<p>76:14. Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like<br>
our God?</p>

<p>76:15. Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power<br>
known among the nations:</p>

<p>76:16. With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob<br>
and of Joseph.</p>

<p>76:17. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were<br>
afraid, and the depths were troubled.</p>

<p>76:18. Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound.<br>
For thy arrows pass:</p>

<p>76:19. The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened<br>
the world: the earth shook and trembled.</p>

<p>76:20. Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy<br>
footsteps shall not be known.</p>

<p>76:21. Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses<br>
and Aaron.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 77</p>

<p>Attendite.</p>

<p>God's great benefits to the people of Israel, notwithstanding their<br>
ingratitude.</p>

<p>77:1. Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline<br>
your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>77:2. I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from<br>
the beginning.</p>

<p>Propositions... Deep and mysterious sayings. By this it appears that the<br>
historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep<br>
and mysterious: as being figures of great truths appertaining to the<br>
time of the New Testament.</p>

<p>77:3. How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have<br>
told us.</p>

<p>77:4. They have not been hidden from their children, in another<br>
generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his<br>
wonders which he hath done.</p>

<p>77:5. And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How<br>
great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same<br>
known to their children:</p>

<p>77:6. That another generation might know them. The children that should<br>
be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.</p>

<p>77:7. That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works<br>
of God: and may seek his commandments.</p>

<p>77:8. That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and<br>
exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright:<br>
and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>

<p>77:9. The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have<br>
turned back in the day of battle.</p>

<p>77:10. They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not<br>
walk.</p>

<p>77:11. And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn<br>
them.</p>

<p>77:12. Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the<br>
land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</p>

<p>77:13. He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the<br>
waters to stand as in a vessel.</p>

<p>77:14. And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with<br>
a light of fire.</p>

<p>77:15. He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as<br>
out of the great deep.</p>

<p>77:16. He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down<br>
as rivers.</p>

<p>77:17. And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most<br>
High to wrath in the place without water.</p>

<p>77:18. And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their<br>
desires.</p>

<p>77:19. And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in<br>
the wilderness?</p>

<p>77:20. Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the<br>
streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his<br>
people?</p>

<p>77:21. Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled<br>
against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.</p>

<p>77:22. Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his<br>
salvation.</p>

<p>77:23. And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the<br>
doors of heaven.</p>

<p>77:24. And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them<br>
the bread of heaven.</p>

<p>77:25. Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in<br>
abundance.</p>

<p>77:26. He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought<br>
in the southwest wind.</p>

<p>77:27. And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like<br>
as the sand of the sea.</p>

<p>77:28. And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their<br>
pavilions.</p>

<p>77:29. So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them<br>
their desire:</p>

<p>77:30. they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their<br>
meat was in their mouth:</p>

<p>77:31. And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones<br>
amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.</p>

<p>77:32. In all these things they sinned still: and they behaved not for<br>
his wondrous works.</p>

<p>77:33. And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.</p>

<p>77:34. When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and<br>
came to him early in the morning.</p>

<p>77:35. And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high<br>
God their redeemer.</p>

<p>77:36. And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they<br>
lied unto him:</p>

<p>77:37. But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted<br>
faithful in his covenant.</p>

<p>77:38. But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not<br>
destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not<br>
kindle all his wrath.</p>

<p>77:39. And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and<br>
returneth not.</p>

<p>77:40. How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to<br>
wrath in the place without water?</p>

<p>77:41. And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of<br>
Israel.</p>

<p>77:42. They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them<br>
from the hand of him that afflicted them:</p>

<p>77:43. How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field<br>
of Tanis.</p>

<p>77:44. And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that<br>
they might not drink.</p>

<p>77:45. He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them:<br>
and frogs which destroyed them.</p>

<p>77:46. And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to<br>
the locust.</p>

<p>77:47. And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry<br>
trees with hoarfrost.</p>

<p>77:48. And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the<br>
fire.</p>

<p>77:49. And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation<br>
and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.</p>

<p>77:50. He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls<br>
from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</p>

<p>77:51. And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the<br>
firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.</p>

<p>77:52. And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the<br>
wilderness like a flock.</p>

<p>77:53. And he brought them out in hope and they feared not: and the sea<br>
overwhelmed their enemies.</p>

<p>77:54. And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the<br>
mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the<br>
Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of<br>
distribution.</p>

<p>77:55. And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.</p>

<p>77:56. Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept<br>
not his testimonies.</p>

<p>77:57. And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their<br>
fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</p>

<p>77:58. They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to<br>
jealousy with their graven things.</p>

<p>77:59. God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly<br>
as it were to nothing.</p>

<p>77:60. And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he<br>
dwelt among men.</p>

<p>77:61. And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty<br>
into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>77:62. And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his<br>
inheritance.</p>

<p>77:63. Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not<br>
lamented.</p>

<p>77:64. Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.</p>

<p>77:65. And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty<br>
man that hath been surfeited with wine.</p>

<p>77:66. And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an<br>
everlasting reproach.</p>

<p>77:67. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe<br>
of Ephraim:</p>

<p>77:68. But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.</p>

<p>77:69. And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he<br>
founded for ever.</p>

<p>As of unicorns... That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn.<br>
This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm,<br>
foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting<br>
sanctuary of God, in his church.</p>

<p>77:70. And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of<br>
sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,</p>

<p>77:71. To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.</p>

<p>77:72. And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them<br>
by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 78</p>

<p>Deus, venerunt gentes.</p>

<p>The church in time of persecution prayeth for relief. It seems to belong<br>
to the time of the Machabees.</p>

<p>78:1. A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy<br>
inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem<br>
as a place to keep fruit.</p>

<p>78:2. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the<br>
fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>78:3. They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem<br>
and there was none to bury them.</p>

<p>78:4. We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision<br>
to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>78:5. How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be<br>
kindled like a fire?</p>

<p>78:6. Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and<br>
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>

<p>78:7. Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place.</p>

<p>78:8. Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily<br>
prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.</p>

<p>78:9. Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O<br>
Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name's sake:</p>

<p>78:10. Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And<br>
let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the<br>
revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:</p>

<p>78:11. Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According<br>
to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them<br>
that have been put to death.</p>

<p>78:12. And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the<br>
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>78:13. But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks<br>
to thee for ever. We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and<br>
generation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 79</p>

<p>Qui regis Israel.</p>

<p>A prayer for the church in tribulation, commemorating God's former<br>
favours.</p>

<p>79:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, a testimony for<br>
Asaph, a psalm.</p>

<p>79:2. Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like<br>
a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth</p>

<p>79:3. Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses. Stir up thy might, and<br>
come to save us.</p>

<p>79:4. Convert us, O God: and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.</p>

<p>79:5. O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the<br>
prayer of thy servant?</p>

<p>79:6. How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: and give us<br>
for our drink tears in measure?</p>

<p>79:7. Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our<br>
enemies have scoffed at us.</p>

<p>79:8. O God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be<br>
saved.</p>

<p>79:9. Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the<br>
Gentiles and planted it.</p>

<p>79:10. Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: thou plantedst<br>
the roots thereof, and it filled the land.</p>

<p>79:11. The shadow of it covered the hills: and the branches thereof the<br>
cedars of God.</p>

<p>79:12. It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto<br>
the river.</p>

<p>79:13. Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who<br>
pass by the way do pluck it?</p>

<p>79:14. The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: and a singular wild<br>
beast hath devoured it.</p>

<p>79:15. Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and<br>
visit this vineyard:</p>

<p>79:16. And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: and upon<br>
the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>

<p>79:17. Things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of thy<br>
countenance.</p>

<p>Things set on fire, etc... So this vineyard of thine, almost consumed<br>
already, must perish, if thou continue thy rebukes.</p>

<p>79:18. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son<br>
of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>

<p>The man of thy right hand... Christ.</p>

<p>79:19. And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: and we will<br>
call upon thy name.</p>

<p>79:20. O Lord God of hosts, convert us and shew thy face, and we shall<br>
be saved.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 80</p>

<p>Exultate Deo.</p>

<p>An invitation to a solemn praising of God.</p>

<p>80:1. Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself.</p>

<p>For the winepresses, etc... Torcularibus. It either signifies a musical<br>
instrument, or that this psalm was to be sung at the feast of the<br>
tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage.</p>

<p>80:2. Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>80:3. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery<br>
with the harp.</p>

<p>80:4. Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your<br>
solemnity.</p>

<p>80:5. For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of<br>
Jacob.</p>

<p>80:6. He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the<br>
land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.</p>

<p>80:7. He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in<br>
baskets.</p>

<p>80:8. Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard<br>
thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of<br>
contradiction.</p>

<p>In the secret place of tempest... Heb., Of thunder. When thou soughtest<br>
to hide thyself from the tempest: or, when I came down to mount Sina,<br>
hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder.</p>

<p>80:9. Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou<br>
wilt hearken to me, &nbsp;&nbsp;10 &nbsp;there shall be no new god in thee: neither<br>
shalt thou adore a strange god.</p>

<p>80:11. For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of<br>
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>

<p>80:12. But my people heard not my voice: and Israel hearkened not to me.</p>

<p>80:13. So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they<br>
shall walk in their own inventions.</p>

<p>80:14. If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways:</p>

<p>80:15. I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on<br>
them that troubled them.</p>

<p>80:16. The enemies of the Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be<br>
for ever.</p>

<p>Their time shall be forever... Impenitent sinners shall suffer for ever.</p>

<p>80:17. And he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey<br>
out of the rock.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 81</p>

<p>Deus stetit.</p>

<p>An exhortation to judges and men in power.</p>

<p>81:1. A psalm for Asaph. God hath stood in the congregation of gods: and<br>
being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.</p>

<p>81:2. How long will you judge unjustly: and accept the persons of the<br>
wicked?</p>

<p>81:3. Judge for the needy and fatherless: do justice to the humble and<br>
the poor.</p>

<p>81:4. Rescue the poor; and deliver the needy out of the hand of the<br>
sinner.</p>

<p>81:5. They have not known nor understood: they walk on in darkness: all<br>
the foundations of the earth shall be moved.</p>

<p>81:6. I have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most<br>
High.</p>

<p>81:7. But you like men shall die: and shall fall like one of the<br>
princes.</p>

<p>81:8. Arise, O God, judge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherit among<br>
all the nations.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 82</p>

<p>Deus, quis similis.</p>

<p>A prayer against the enemies of God's church.</p>

<p>82:1. A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.</p>

<p>82:2. O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be<br>
thou still, O God.</p>

<p>82:3. For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee<br>
have lifted up the head.</p>

<p>82:4. They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have<br>
consulted against thy saints.</p>

<p>82:5. They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not<br>
a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.</p>

<p>82:6. For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a<br>
covenant together against thee,</p>

<p>82:7. The tabernacle of the Edomites, and the Ishmahelites: Moab, and<br>
the Agarens,</p>

<p>82:8. Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants<br>
of Tyre.</p>

<p>82:9. Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to<br>
the aid of the sons of Lot.</p>

<p>82:10. Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at<br>
the brook of Cisson.</p>

<p>82:11. Who perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth.</p>

<p>82:12. Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana.<br>
All their princes,</p>

<p>82:13. Who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an<br>
inheritance.</p>

<p>82:14. O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind.</p>

<p>82:15. As fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains:</p>

<p>82:16. So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: and shalt trouble<br>
them in thy wrath.</p>

<p>82:17. Fill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O<br>
Lord.</p>

<p>82:18. Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: and let them<br>
be confounded and perish.</p>

<p>82:19. And let them know that the Lord is thy name: thou alone art the<br>
most High over all the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 83</p>

<p>Quam dilecta.</p>

<p>The soul aspireth after heaven; rejoicing in the mean time, in being in<br>
the communion of God's church upon earth.</p>

<p>83:1. Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>83:2. How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</p>

<p>83:3. my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart<br>
and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.</p>

<p>83:4. For the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtle a nest<br>
for herself where she may lay her young ones: Thy altars, O Lord of<br>
hosts, my king and my God.</p>

<p>83:5. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: they shall<br>
praise thee for ever and ever.</p>

<p>83:6. Blessed is the man whose help is from thee: in his heart he hath<br>
disposed to ascend by steps,</p>

<p>In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, etc... Ascensiones in<br>
corde suo disposuit. As by steps men ascended to the temple of God<br>
situated on a hill; so the good Christian ascends towards the eternal<br>
temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heart:<br>
and this whilst he lives as yet in the body, in this vale of tears, the<br>
place which man hath set: that is, which he hath brought himself to:<br>
being cast out of paradise for his sin.</p>

<p>83:7. In the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.</p>

<p>83:8. For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue<br>
to virtue: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.</p>

<p>83:9. O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.</p>

<p>83:10. Behold, O God our protector: and look on the face of thy Christ.</p>

<p>83:11. For better is one day in thy courts above thousands. I have<br>
chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in<br>
the tabernacles of sinners.</p>

<p>83:12. For God loveth mercy and truth: the Lord will give grace and<br>
glory.</p>

<p>83:13. He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence: O<br>
Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 84</p>

<p>Benedixisti, Domine.</p>

<p>The coming of Christ, to bring peace and salvation to man.</p>

<p>84:1. Unto the end, for the sons of Core, a psalm.</p>

<p>84:2. Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the<br>
captivity of Jacob.</p>

<p>84:3. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered<br>
all their sins.</p>

<p>84:4. Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the<br>
wrath of thy indignation.</p>

<p>84:5. Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us.</p>

<p>84:6. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath<br>
from generation to generation?</p>

<p>84:7. Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall<br>
rejoice in thee.</p>

<p>84:8. Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.</p>

<p>84:9. I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak<br>
peace unto his people: And unto his saints: and unto them that are<br>
converted to the heart.</p>

<p>84:10. Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: that glory<br>
may dwell in our land.</p>

<p>84:11. Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have<br>
kissed.</p>

<p>84:12. Truth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down<br>
from heaven.</p>

<p>84:13. For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her<br>
fruit.</p>

<p>84:14. Justice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the<br>
way.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 85</p>

<p>Inclina, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer for God's grace to assist us to the end.</p>

<p>85:1. A prayer for David himself. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me:<br>
for I am needy and poor.</p>

<p>85:2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy: save thy servant, O my God, that<br>
trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>I am holy... I am by my office and profession dedicated to thy service.</p>

<p>85:3. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day.</p>

<p>85:4. Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have<br>
lifted up my soul.</p>

<p>85:5. For thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: and plenteous in mercy to<br>
all that call upon thee.</p>

<p>85:6. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer: and attend to the voice of my<br>
petition.</p>

<p>85:7. I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: because thou<br>
hast heard me.</p>

<p>85:8. There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: and there is<br>
none according to thy works.</p>

<p>85:9. All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O<br>
Lord: and they shall glorify thy name.</p>

<p>85:10. For thou art great and dost wonderful things: thou art God alone.</p>

<p>85:11. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let<br>
my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.</p>

<p>85:12. I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I<br>
will glorify thy name for ever:</p>

<p>85:13. For thy mercy is great towards me: and thou hast delivered my<br>
soul out of the lower hell.</p>

<p>85:14. O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of<br>
the mighty have sought my soul: and they have not set thee before their<br>
eyes.</p>

<p>85:15. And thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, patient,<br>
and of much mercy, and true.</p>

<p>85:16. O look upon me, and have mercy on me: give thy command to thy<br>
servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.</p>

<p>85:17. Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be<br>
confounded, because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 86</p>

<p>Fundamenta ejus.</p>

<p>The glory of the church of Christ.</p>

<p>86:1. For the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle. The foundations<br>
thereof are the holy mountains:</p>

<p>The holy mountains... The apostles and prophets. Eph. 2.20.</p>

<p>86:2. The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of<br>
Jacob.</p>

<p>86:3. Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.</p>

<p>86:4. I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold the<br>
foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were<br>
there.</p>

<p>Rahab... Egypt, etc. To this Sion, which is the church of God, many<br>
shall resort from all nations.</p>

<p>86:5. Shall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? &nbsp;and the<br>
Highest himself hath founded her.</p>

<p>Shall not Sion say, etc... The meaning is, that Sion, viz., the church,<br>
shall not only be able to commemorate this or that particular person of<br>
renown born in her, but also to glory in great multitudes of people and<br>
princes of her communion; who have been foretold in the writings of the<br>
prophets, and registered in the writings of the apostles.</p>

<p>86:6. The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of<br>
them that have been in her.</p>

<p>86:7. The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 87</p>

<p>Domine, Deus salutis.</p>

<p>A prayer of one under grievous affliction: it agrees to Christ in his<br>
passion, and alludes to his death and burial.</p>

<p>87:1. A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for<br>
Maheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>Maheleth... A musical instrument, or chorus of musicians, to answer one<br>
another.-Ibid. Understanding... Or a psalm of instruction, composed by<br>
Eman the Ezrahite, or by David, in his name.</p>

<p>87:2. O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in<br>
the night before thee.</p>

<p>87:3. Let my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition.</p>

<p>87:4. For my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to<br>
hell.</p>

<p>87:5. I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a<br>
man without help,</p>

<p>87:6. Free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres,<br>
whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>

<p>87:7. They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the<br>
shadow of death.</p>

<p>87:8. Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought<br>
in upon me.</p>

<p>87:9. Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me<br>
an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth:</p>

<p>87:10. My eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee,<br>
O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee.</p>

<p>87:11. Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to<br>
life, and give praise to thee?</p>

<p>87:12. Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth<br>
in destruction?</p>

<p>87:13. Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the<br>
land of forgetfulness?</p>

<p>87:14. But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer<br>
shall prevent thee.</p>

<p>87:15. Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy<br>
face from me?</p>

<p>87:16. I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have<br>
been humbled and troubled.</p>

<p>87:17. Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me.</p>

<p>87:18. They have come round about me like water all the day: they have<br>
compassed me about together.</p>

<p>87:19. Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my<br>
acquaintance, because of misery.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 88</p>

<p>Misericordias Domini.</p>

<p>The perpetuity of the church of Christ, in consequence of the promise of<br>
God: which, notwithstanding, God permits her to suffer sometimes most<br>
grievous afflictions.</p>

<p>88:1. Of understanding, for Ethan the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>88:2. The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth<br>
thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation.</p>

<p>88:3. For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the<br>
heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them.</p>

<p>88:4. I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my<br>
servant:</p>

<p>88:5. Thy seed will I settle for ever. And I will build up thy throne<br>
unto generation and generation.</p>

<p>88:6. The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: and thy truth in<br>
the church of the saints.</p>

<p>88:7. For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among<br>
the sons of God shall be like to God?</p>

<p>88:8. God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and<br>
terrible above all them that are about him.</p>

<p>88:9. O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord,<br>
and thy truth is round about thee.</p>

<p>88:10. Thou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the<br>
waves thereof.</p>

<p>88:11. Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the<br>
arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.</p>

<p>88:12. Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the<br>
fulness thereof thou hast founded:</p>

<p>88:13. The north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall<br>
rejoice in thy name:</p>

<p>88:14. Thy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy<br>
right hand exalted:</p>

<p>88:15. Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and<br>
truth shall go before thy face:</p>

<p>88:16. Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation. They shall walk, O<br>
Lord, in the light of thy countenance:</p>

<p>88:17. And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy<br>
justice they shall be exalted.</p>

<p>88:18. For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy good<br>
pleasure shall our horn be exalted.</p>

<p>88:19. For our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one<br>
of Israel.</p>

<p>88:20. Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have<br>
laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my<br>
people.</p>

<p>88:21. I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed<br>
him.</p>

<p>88:22. For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.</p>

<p>88:23. The enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of<br>
iniquity have power to hurt him.</p>

<p>88:24. And I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that<br>
hate him I will put to flight.</p>

<p>88:25. And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall<br>
his horn be exalted.</p>

<p>88:26. And I will set his hand in the sea; and his right hand in the<br>
rivers.</p>

<p>88:27. He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the<br>
support of my salvation.</p>

<p>88:28. And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the<br>
earth.</p>

<p>88:29. I will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful<br>
to him.</p>

<p>88:30. And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: and his throne<br>
as the days of heaven.</p>

<p>88:31. And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:</p>

<p>88:32. If they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments:</p>

<p>88:33. I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with<br>
stripes.</p>

<p>88:34. But my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my<br>
truth to fail.</p>

<p>88:35. Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed<br>
from my mouth I will not make void.</p>

<p>88:36. Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</p>

<p>88:37. His seed shall endure for ever.</p>

<p>88:38. And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for<br>
ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</p>

<p>88:39. But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with my<br>
anointed.</p>

<p>88:40. Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast<br>
profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</p>

<p>Overthrown the covenant, etc... All this seems to relate to the time of<br>
the captivity of Babylon, in which, for the sins of the people and their<br>
princes, God seemed to have set aside for a while the covenant he made<br>
with David.</p>

<p>88:41. Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength<br>
fear.</p>

<p>88:42. All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach<br>
to his neighbours.</p>

<p>88:43. Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou<br>
hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>

<p>88:44. Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not<br>
assisted him in battle.</p>

<p>88:45. Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his<br>
throne down to the ground.</p>

<p>88:46. Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him<br>
with confusion.</p>

<p>88:47. How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger<br>
burn like fire?</p>

<p>88:48. Remember what my substance is: for hast thou made all the<br>
children of men in vain?</p>

<p>88:49. Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall<br>
deliver his soul from the hand of hell?</p>

<p>88:50. Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, according to what thou didst<br>
swear to David in thy truth?</p>

<p>88:51. Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have<br>
held in my bosom) of many nations:</p>

<p>88:52. Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they<br>
have reproached the change of thy anointed.</p>

<p>88:53. Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 89</p>

<p>Domine, refugium.</p>

<p>A prayer for the mercy of God: recounting the shortness and miseries of<br>
the days of man.</p>

<p>89:1. A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge<br>
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>89:2. Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was<br>
formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.</p>

<p>89:3. Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be<br>
converted, O ye sons of men.</p>

<p>Turn not man away, etc... Suffer him not quite to perish from thee,<br>
since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee.</p>

<p>89:4. For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past.<br>
And as a watch in the night,</p>

<p>89:5. Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.</p>

<p>89:6. In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he<br>
shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry,<br>
and wither.</p>

<p>89:7. For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy<br>
indignation.</p>

<p>89:8. Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the<br>
light of thy countenance.</p>

<p>89:9. For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away.<br>
Our years shall be considered as a spider:</p>

<p>As a spider... As frail and weak as a spider's web; and miserable<br>
withal, whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to<br>
catch flies.</p>

<p>89:10. The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But<br>
if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is<br>
labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be<br>
corrected.</p>

<p>Mildness is come upon us, etc... God's mildness corrects us; inasmuch as<br>
he deals kindly with us, in shortening the days of this miserable life;<br>
and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments, and<br>
teaching us true wisdom.</p>

<p>89:11. Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear</p>

<p>89:12. Can number thy wrath? &nbsp;So make thy right hand known: and men<br>
learned in heart, in wisdom.</p>

<p>89:13. Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy<br>
servants.</p>

<p>89:14. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have<br>
rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.</p>

<p>89:15. We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for<br>
the years in which we have seen evils.</p>

<p>89:16. Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their<br>
children.</p>

<p>89:17. And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct<br>
thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou<br>
direct.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 90</p>

<p>Qui habitat.</p>

<p>The just is secure under the protection of God.</p>

<p>90:1. The praise of a canticle for David. He that dwelleth in the aid of<br>
the most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>90:2. He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: my<br>
God, in him will I trust.</p>

<p>90:3. For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: and from<br>
the sharp word.</p>

<p>90:4. He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: and under his wings<br>
thou shalt trust.</p>

<p>90:5. His truth shall compass thee with a shield: thou shalt not be<br>
afraid of the terror of the night.</p>

<p>90:6. Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh<br>
about in the dark: of invasion, or of the noonday devil.</p>

<p>90:7. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right<br>
hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>

<p>90:8. But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: and shalt see the reward of<br>
the wicked.</p>

<p>90:9. Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou hast made the most High<br>
thy refuge.</p>

<p>90:10. There shall no evil come to thee: nor shall the scourge come near<br>
thy dwelling.</p>

<p>90:11. For he hath given his angels charge over thee; to keep thee in<br>
all thy ways.</p>

<p>90:12. In their hands they shall bear thee up: lest thou dash thy foot<br>
against a stone.</p>

<p>90:13. Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt<br>
trample under foot the lion and the dragon.</p>

<p>90:14. Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: I will protect him<br>
because he hath known my name.</p>

<p>90:15. He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I am with him in<br>
tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.</p>

<p>90:16. I will fill him with length of days; and I will shew him my<br>
salvation.</p>

<p>91:2. It is good to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to thy name, O<br>
most High.</p>

<p>91:3. To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the<br>
night: 91:4. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: with<br>
a canticle upon the harp.</p>

<p>91:5. For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: and in<br>
the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.</p>

<p>91:6. O Lord, how great are thy works! thy thoughts are exceeding deep.</p>

<p>91:7. The senseless man shall not know: nor will the fool understand<br>
these things.</p>

<p>91:8. When the wicked shall spring up as grass: and all the workers of<br>
iniquity shall appear: That they may perish for ever and ever:</p>

<p>91:9. But thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.</p>

<p>91:10. For behold thy enemies, O lord, for behold thy enemies shall<br>
perish: and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

<p>91:11. But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: and my old<br>
age in plentiful mercy.</p>

<p>91:12. My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: and my ear shall<br>
hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.</p>

<p>91:13. The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like<br>
the cedar of Libanus.</p>

<p>91:14. They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in<br>
the courts of the house of our God.</p>

<p>91:15. They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: and shall be<br>
well treated,</p>

<p>91:16. That they may shew, That the Lord our God is righteous, and there<br>
is no iniquity in him.</p>

Christ.</p>

clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established<br>
the world which shall not be moved.</p>

<p>92:3. The floods have lifted up, O Lord: the floods have lifted up their<br>
voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,</p>

sea: wonderful is the Lord on high.</p>

thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.</p>

hath acted freely.</p>

the proud.</p>

<p>93:3. How long shall sinners, O Lord: how long shall sinners glory?</p>

<p>93:4. Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: shall all speak who work<br>
injustice?</p>

<p>93:5. Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: and they have afflicted<br>
thy inheritance.</p>

<p>93:6. They have slain the widow and the stranger: and they have murdered<br>
the fatherless.</p>

<p>93:7. And they have said: The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God<br>
of Jacob understand.</p>

<p>93:8. Understand, ye senseless among the people: and, you fools, be wise<br>
at last.</p>

<p>93:9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that formed the<br>
eye, doth he not consider?</p>

<p>93:10. He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: he that teacheth<br>
man knowledge?</p>

<p>93:11. The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain.</p>

<p>93:12. Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct, O Lord: and shalt<br>
teach him out of thy law.</p>

<p>93:13. That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: till a pit be<br>
dug for the wicked.</p>

<p>Rest from the evil days... That thou mayst mitigate the sorrows, to<br>
which he is exposed, during the short and evil days of his mortality.</p>

<p>93:14. For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he<br>
forsake his own inheritance.</p>

<p>93:15. Until justice be turned into judgment: and they that are near it<br>
are all the upright in heart.</p>

<p>Until justice be turned into judgment, etc... By being put in execution;<br>
which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart.</p>

<p>93:16. Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? or who shall<br>
stand with me against the workers of iniquity?</p>

<p>93:17. Unless the Lord had been my helper, my soul had almost dwelt in<br>
hell.</p>

<p>93:18. If I said: My foot is moved: thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.</p>

<p>93:19. According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy<br>
comforts have given joy to my soul.</p>

<p>93:20. Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, who framest labour in<br>
commandment?</p>

<p>Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, etc... That is, wilt thou, O<br>
God, who art always just, admit of the seat of iniquity: that is, of<br>
injustice, or unjust judges, to have any partnership with thee? Thou who<br>
framest, or makest, labour in commandment, that is, thou who obligest us<br>
to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments.</p>

<p>93:21. They will hunt after the soul of the just, and will condemn<br>
innocent blood.</p>

<p>93:22. But the Lord is my refuge: and my God the help of my hope.</p>

<p>93:23. And he will render them their iniquity: and in their malice he<br>
will destroy them: the Lord our God will destroy them.</p>

our saviour.</p>

<p>94:2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a<br>
joyful noise to him with psalms.</p>

<p>94:3. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>

<p>94:4. For in his hand are all the ends of the earth: and the heights of<br>
the mountains are his.</p>

<p>94:5. For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry<br>
land.</p>

<p>94:6. Come let us adore and fall down: and weep before the Lord that<br>
made us.</p>

<p>94:7. For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture<br>
and the sheep of his hand.</p>

<p>94:8. To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</p>

<p>94:9. As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the<br>
wilderness: where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my<br>
works.</p>

<p>94:10. Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said:<br>
These always err in heart.</p>

<p>94:11. And these men have not known my ways: so I swore in my wrath that<br>
they shall not enter into my rest.</p>

heavens.</p>

with justice.</p>

be moved, and the fulness thereof:</p>

<p>95:12. The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then<br>
shall all the trees of the woods rejoice</p>

<p>95:13. before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh<br>
to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the<br>
people with his truth.</p>

Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.</p>

<p>96:2. Clouds and darkness are round about him: justice and judgment are<br>
the establishment of his throne.</p>

<p>Clouds and darkness... The coming of Christ in the clouds with great<br>
terror and majesty to judge the world, is here prophesied.</p>

<p>96:3. A fire shall go before him, and shall burn his enemies round<br>
about.</p>

<p>96:4. His lightnings have shone forth to the world: the earth saw and<br>
trembled.</p>

<p>96:5. The mountains melted like wax, at the presence of the Lord: at the<br>
presence of the Lord of all the earth.</p>

<p>96:6. The heavens declared his justice: and all people saw his glory.</p>

glory in their idols. Adore him, all you his angels:</p>

<p>96:8. Sion heard, and was glad. And the daughters of Juda rejoiced,<br>
because of thy judgments, O Lord.</p>

<p>96:9. For thou art the most high Lord over all the earth: thou art<br>
exalted exceedingly above all gods.</p>

<p>96:10. You that love the Lord, hate evil: the Lord preserveth the souls<br>
of his saints, he will deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.</p>

<p>96:11. Light is risen to the just, and joy to the right of heart.</p>

<p>96:12. Rejoice, ye just, in the Lord: and give praise to the remembrance<br>
of his holiness.</p>

justice in the sight of the Gentiles.</p>

Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

sing.</p>

<p>97:5. Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the<br>
voice of a psalm:</p>

before the Lord our king:</p>

<p>97:7. Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof: the world and they<br>
that dwell therein.</p>

<p>97:8. The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice<br>
together</p>

<p>97:9. At the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth.<br>
He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 98</p>

<p>Dominus regnavit.</p>

<p>The reign of the Lord in Sion: that is, of Christ in his church.</p>

<p>98:1. A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned, let the people<br>
be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.</p>

<p>Let the people be angry... Though many enemies rage, and the whole earth<br>
be stirred up to oppose the reign of Christ, he shall still prevail.</p>

<p>98:2. The lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.</p>

<p>98:3. Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and<br>
holy:</p>

<p>98:4. And the king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared<br>
directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.</p>

<p>Loveth judgment... Requireth discretion.-Ibid. Directions... Most right<br>
and just laws to direct men.</p>

<p>98:5. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is<br>
holy.</p>

<p>Adore his footstool... The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old<br>
Testament, God's footstool: over which he was understood to sit, on his<br>
propitiatory, or mercy seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the<br>
cherubims, in the sanctuary: to which the children of Israel paid a<br>
great veneration. But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the<br>
New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand<br>
this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of<br>
Christ in the sacred mysteries: inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is,<br>
as it were, the footstool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, L. 3. De<br>
Spiritu Sancto, c. 12. And St. Augustine upon this psalm.</p>

<p>98:6. Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call<br>
upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:</p>

<p>Moses and Aaron among his priests... By this it is evident, that Moses<br>
also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, inasmuch as he<br>
consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him. Lev. 8. So that his<br>
pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship.</p>

<p>98:7. He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his<br>
testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.</p>

<p>98:8. Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to<br>
them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.</p>

<p>All their inventions... that is, all the enterprises of their enemies<br>
against them, as in the case of Core, Dathan, and Abiron.</p>

<p>98:9. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the<br>
Lord our God is holy.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 99</p>

<p>Jubilate Deo.</p>

<p>All are invited to rejoice in God the creator of all.</p>

<p>99:1. A psalm of praise.</p>

<p>99:2. Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve ye the Lord with<br>
gladness. Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>99:3. Know ye that the Lord he is God: he made us, and not we ourselves.<br>
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p>99:4. Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns: and<br>
give glory to him. Praise ye his name:</p>

<p>99:5. For the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth<br>
to generation and generation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 100</p>

<p>Misericordiam et judicium.</p>

<p>The prophet exhorteth all by his example, to follow mercy and justice.</p>

<p>100:1. A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to<br>
thee, O Lord: I will sing,</p>

<p>100:2. And I will understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come<br>
to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.</p>

<p>I will understand, etc... That is, I will apply my mind, I will do my<br>
endeavour, to know and to follow the perfect way of thy commandments:<br>
not trusting to my own strength, but relying on thy coming to me by thy<br>
grace.</p>

<p>100:3. I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the<br>
workers of iniquities.</p>

<p>100:4. The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that<br>
turned aside from me, I would not know.</p>

<p>100:5. The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I<br>
persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I<br>
would not eat.</p>

<p>100:6. My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: the<br>
man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.</p>

<p>100:7. He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house:<br>
he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.</p>

<p>100:8. In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: that I<br>
might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 101</p>

<p>Domine, exaudi.</p>

<p>A prayer for one in affliction: the fifth penitential psalm.</p>

<p>101:1. The prayer of the poor man, when he was anxious, and poured out<br>
his supplication before the Lord.</p>

<p>101:2. Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.</p>

<p>101:3. Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble,<br>
incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear<br>
me speedily.</p>

<p>101:4. For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry<br>
like fuel for the fire.</p>

<p>101:5. I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: because I forgot<br>
to eat my bread.</p>

<p>101:6. Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my<br>
flesh.</p>

<p>101:7. I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: I am like a<br>
night raven in the house.</p>

<p>A pelican, etc... I am become through grief, like birds that affect<br>
solitude and darkness.</p>

<p>101:8. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the<br>
housetop.</p>

<p>101:9. All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised<br>
me did swear against me.</p>

<p>101:10. For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with<br>
weeping.</p>

<p>101:11. Because of thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up<br>
thou hast thrown me down.</p>

<p>101:12. My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like<br>
grass.</p>

<p>101:13. But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy memorial to all<br>
generations.</p>

<p>101:14. Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have<br>
mercy on it, for the time is come.</p>

<p>101:15. For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall<br>
have pity on the earth thereof.</p>

<p>101:16. All the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings<br>
of the earth thy glory.</p>

<p>101:17. For the Lord hath built up Sion: and he shall be seen in his<br>
glory.</p>

<p>101:18. He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not<br>
despised their petition.</p>

<p>101:19. Let these things be written unto another generation: and the<br>
people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:</p>

<p>101:20. Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: from<br>
heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.</p>

<p>101:21. That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that<br>
he might release the children of the slain:</p>

<p>101:22. That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his<br>
praise in Jerusalem;</p>

<p>101:23. When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the Lord.</p>

<p>101:24. He answered him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the<br>
fewness of my days.</p>

<p>He answered him in the way of his strength... That is, the people,<br>
mentioned in the foregoing verse, or the penitent, in whose person this<br>
psalm is delivered, answered the Lord in the way of his strength: that<br>
is, according to the best of his power and strength: or when he was in<br>
the flower of his age and strength: inquiring after the fewness of his<br>
days: to know if he should live long enough to see the happy restoration<br>
of Sion, etc.</p>

<p>101:25. Call me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are unto<br>
generation and generation.</p>

<p>101:26. In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: and the<br>
heavens are the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>101:27. They shall perish but thou remainest: and all of them shall grow<br>
old like a garment: And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they<br>
shall be changed.</p>

<p>101:28. But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.</p>

<p>101:29. The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall<br>
be directed for ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 102</p>

<p>Benedic, anima.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving to God for his mercies.</p>

<p>102:1. For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is<br>
within me bless his holy name.</p>

<p>102:2. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for<br>
thee.</p>

<p>102:3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.</p>

<p>102:4. Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with<br>
mercy and compassion.</p>

<p>102:5. Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be<br>
renewed like the eagle's.</p>

<p>102:6. The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.</p>

<p>102:7. He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children<br>
of Israel.</p>

<p>102:8. The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and<br>
plenteous in mercy. 102:9. He will not always be angry: nor will he<br>
threaten for ever.</p>

<p>102:10. He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us<br>
according to our iniquities.</p>

<p>102:11. For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he<br>
hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.</p>

<p>102:12. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our<br>
iniquities from us.</p>

<p>102:13. As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord<br>
compassion on them that fear him:</p>

<p>102:14. For he knoweth our frame. He remembereth that we are dust:</p>

<p>102:15. Man's days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he<br>
flourish.</p>

<p>102:16. For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: and he<br>
shall know his place no more.</p>

<p>102:17. But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity<br>
upon them that fear him: And his justice unto children's children,</p>

<p>102:18. To such as keep his covenant, And are mindful of his<br>
commandments to do them.</p>

<p>102:19. The lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: and his kingdom<br>
shall rule over all.</p>

<p>102:20. Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: you that are mighty in<br>
strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.</p>

<p>102:21. Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: you ministers of his that do<br>
his will.</p>

<p>102:22. Bless the Lord, all his works: in every place of his dominion, O<br>
my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 103</p>

<p>Benedic, anima.</p>

<p>God is to be praised for his mighty works, and wonderful providence.</p>

<p>103:1. For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou<br>
art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:</p>

<p>103:2. And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out<br>
the heaven like a pavilion:</p>

<p>103:3. Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the<br>
clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.</p>

<p>103:4. Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</p>

<p>103:5. Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be<br>
moved for ever and ever.</p>

<p>103:6. The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains<br>
shall the waters stand.</p>

<p>103:7. At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they<br>
shall fear.</p>

<p>103:8. The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which<br>
thou hast founded for them.</p>

<p>103:9. Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither<br>
shall they return to cover the earth.</p>

<p>103:10. Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of<br>
the hills the waters shall pass.</p>

<p>103:11. All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall<br>
expect in their thirst.</p>

<p>103:12. Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of<br>
the rocks they shall give forth their voices.</p>

<p>103:13. Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be<br>
filled with the fruit of thy works:</p>

<p>103:14. Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of<br>
men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</p>

<p>103:15. And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the<br>
face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart.</p>

<p>103:16. The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of<br>
Libanus which he hath planted:</p>

<p>103:17. There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them<br>
is the house of the heron.</p>

<p>103:18. The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the<br>
irchins.</p>

<p>103:19. He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going<br>
down.</p>

<p>103:20. Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all<br>
the beasts of the woods go about:</p>

<p>103:21. The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat<br>
from God.</p>

<p>103:22. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall<br>
lie down in their dens.</p>

<p>103:23. Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the<br>
evening.</p>

<p>103:24. How great are thy works, O Lord? thou hast made all things in<br>
wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.</p>

<p>103:25. So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are<br>
creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.</p>

<p>103:26. There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed<br>
to play therein.</p>

<p>103:27. All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.</p>

<p>103:28. What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest<br>
thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.</p>

<p>103:29. But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou<br>
shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to<br>
their dust.</p>

<p>103:30. Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and<br>
thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</p>

<p>103:31. May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall<br>
rejoice in his works.</p>

<p>103:32. He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he troubleth<br>
the mountains, and they smoke.</p>

<p>103:33. I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to<br>
my God while I have my being.</p>

<p>103:34. Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in<br>
the Lord.</p>

<p>103:35. Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so<br>
that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 104</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>A thanksgiving to God for his benefits to his people Israel.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>104:1. Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds<br>
among the Gentiles.</p>

<p>104:2. Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous<br>
works.</p>

<p>104:3. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that<br>
seek the Lord.</p>

<p>104:4. Seek ye the lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.</p>

<p>104:5. Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders,<br>
and the judgments of his mouth.</p>

<p>104:6. O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.</p>

<p>104:7. He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>

<p>104:8. He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he<br>
commanded to a thousand generations.</p>

<p>104:9. Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:</p>

<p>104:10. And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for<br>
an everlasting testament:</p>

<p>104:11. Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your<br>
inheritance.</p>

<p>104:12. When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners<br>
therein:</p>

<p>104:13. And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to<br>
another people.</p>

<p>104:14. He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their<br>
sakes.</p>

<p>104:15. Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</p>

<p>104:16. And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all<br>
the support of bread.</p>

<p>104:17. He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.</p>

<p>104:18. They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,</p>

<p>104:19. Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.</p>

<p>104:20. The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and<br>
he set him at liberty.</p>

<p>104:21. He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his<br>
possession.</p>

<p>104:22. That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his<br>
ancients wisdom.</p>

<p>104:23. And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the<br>
land of Cham.</p>

<p>104:24. And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them<br>
over their enemies.</p>

<p>104:25. He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal<br>
deceitfully with his servants.</p>

<p>He turned their heart, etc... Not that God (who is never the author of<br>
sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the<br>
Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of<br>
the benefits which God bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>104:26. He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.</p>

<p>104:27. He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the<br>
land of Cham.</p>

<p>104:28. He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his<br>
words.</p>

<p>Grieved not his words... That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his<br>
words: or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words:<br>
or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of<br>
Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with<br>
darkness.</p>

<p>104:29. He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.</p>

<p>104:30. Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their<br>
kings.</p>

<p>104:31. He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in<br>
all their coasts.</p>

<p>Sciniphs... See the annotation, Ex.8.16.</p>

<p>104:32. He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.</p>

<p>104:33. And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he<br>
broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.</p>

<p>104:34. He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there<br>
was no number.</p>

<p>Bruchus... An insect of the locust kind.</p>

<p>104:35. And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all<br>
the fruit of their ground.</p>

<p>104:36. And he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of<br>
all their labour.</p>

<p>104:37. And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not<br>
among their tribes one that was feeble.</p>

<p>104:38. Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon<br>
them.</p>

<p>104:39. He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them<br>
light in the night.</p>

<p>104:40. They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the<br>
bread of heaven.</p>

<p>104:41. He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the<br>
dry land.</p>

<p>104:42. Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his<br>
servant Abraham.</p>

<p>104:43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with<br>
gladness.</p>

<p>104:44. And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed<br>
the labours of the people:</p>

<p>104:45. That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his<br>
law.</p>

<p>His justifications... That is, his commandments; which here, and in many<br>
other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the<br>
keeping of them makes man just. The Protestants render it by the word<br>
statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works<br>
to justify.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 105</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>A confession of the manifold sins and ingratitudes of the Israelites.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>105:1. Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth<br>
for ever.</p>

<p>105:2. Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all<br>
his praises?</p>

<p>105:3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.</p>

<p>105:4. Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with<br>
thy salvation.</p>

<p>105:5. That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in<br>
the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.</p>

<p>105:6. We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have<br>
wrought iniquity.</p>

<p>105:7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered<br>
not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to<br>
the sea, even the Red Sea.</p>

<p>105:8. And he saved them for his own name's sake: that he might make his<br>
power known.</p>

<p>105:9. And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them<br>
through the depths, as in a wilderness.</p>

<p>105:10. And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he<br>
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>

<p>105:11. And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not<br>
one of them left.</p>

<p>105:12. And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.</p>

<p>105:13. They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited<br>
not for his counsel.</p>

<p>105:14. And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted<br>
God in the place without water.</p>

<p>105:15. And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their<br>
souls.</p>

<p>105:16. And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the<br>
Lord.</p>

<p>105:17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the<br>
congregation of Abiron.</p>

<p>105:18. And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned<br>
the wicked.</p>

<p>105:19. They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven<br>
thing.</p>

<p>105:20. And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that<br>
eateth grass.</p>

<p>105:21. They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in<br>
Egypt,</p>

<p>105:22. Wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red<br>
Sea.</p>

<p>105:23. And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen<br>
stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should<br>
destroy them.</p>

<p>105:24. And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his<br>
word,</p>

<p>105:25. And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the<br>
voice of the Lord.</p>

<p>105:26. And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the<br>
desert;</p>

<p>105:27. And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter<br>
them in the countries.</p>

<p>105:28. They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices<br>
of the dead.</p>

<p>Initiated... That is, they dedicated, or consecrated themselves to the<br>
idol of the Moabites and Madianites, called Beelphegor, or Baal-Peor.<br>
Num. 25.3.-Ibid. The dead... Viz., idols without life.</p>

<p>105:29. And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was<br>
multiplied among them.</p>

<p>105:30. Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter<br>
ceased.</p>

<p>105:31. And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and<br>
generation for evermore.</p>

<p>105:32. They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses<br>
was afflicted for their sakes:</p>

<p>105:33. Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with<br>
his lips.</p>

<p>He distinguished with his lips... Moses, by occasion of the people's<br>
rebellion and incredulity, was guilty of distinguishing with his lips;<br>
when, instead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded, he said to<br>
the people, with a certain hesitation in his faith, Hear ye, rebellious<br>
and incredulous: Can we from this rock bring out water for you? Num.<br>
20.10.</p>

<p>105:34. They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto<br>
them.</p>

<p>105:35. And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their<br>
works:</p>

<p>105:36. And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.</p>

<p>105:37. And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.</p>

<p>105:38. And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of<br>
their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the<br>
land was polluted with blood,</p>

<p>105:39. And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after<br>
their own inventions.</p>

<p>105:40. And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he<br>
abhorred his inheritance.</p>

<p>105:41. And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they<br>
that hated them had dominion over them.</p>

<p>105:42. And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under<br>
their hands:</p>

<p>105:43. Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their<br>
counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.</p>

<p>105:44. And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their<br>
prayer.</p>

<p>105:45. And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to<br>
the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>105:46. And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that<br>
had made them captives.</p>

<p>105:47. Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among the nations:<br>
That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.</p>

<p>105:48. Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to<br>
everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 106</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>All are invited to give thanks to God for his perpetual providence over<br>
men..</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>106:1. Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth<br>
for ever.</p>

<p>106:2. Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath<br>
redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.</p>

<p>106:3. From the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north<br>
and from the sea.</p>

<p>106:4. They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they<br>
found not the way of a city for their habitation.</p>

<p>106:5. They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.</p>

<p>106:6. And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered<br>
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:7. And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city<br>
of habitation.</p>

<p>106:8. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful<br>
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:9. For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry<br>
soul with good things.</p>

<p>106:10. Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in<br>
want and in iron.</p>

<p>106:11. Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the<br>
counsel of the most High:</p>

<p>106:12. And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened,<br>
and there was none to help them.</p>

<p>106:13. Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he<br>
delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:14. And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death;<br>
and broke their bonds in sunder.</p>

<p>106:15. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful<br>
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:16. Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.</p>

<p>106:17. He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were<br>
brought low for their injustices.</p>

<p>106:18. Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even<br>
to the gates of death.</p>

<p>106:19. And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered<br>
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:20. He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their<br>
destructions.</p>

<p>106:21. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful<br>
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his<br>
works with joy.</p>

<p>106:23. They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the<br>
great waters:</p>

<p>106:24. These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the<br>
deep.</p>

<p>106:25. He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves<br>
thereof were lifted up.</p>

<p>106:26. They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths:<br>
their soul pined away with evils.</p>

<p>106:27. They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their<br>
wisdom was swallowed up.</p>

<p>106:28. And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought<br>
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:29. And he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still.</p>

<p>106:30. And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them<br>
to the haven which they wished for.</p>

<p>106:31. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful<br>
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:32. And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise<br>
him in the chair of the ancients.</p>

<p>106:33. He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of<br>
waters into dry ground:</p>

<p>106:34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that<br>
dwell therein.</p>

<p>106:35. He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land<br>
into water springs.</p>

<p>106:36. And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their<br>
habitation.</p>

<p>106:37. Anti they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded<br>
fruit of birth.</p>

<p>106:38. And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and<br>
their cattle he suffered not to decrease.</p>

<p>106:39. Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted<br>
through the trouble of evils and sorrow.</p>

<p>106:40. Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them<br>
to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.</p>

<p>106:41. And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families<br>
like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>106:42. The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall<br>
stop her mouth.</p>

<p>106:43. Who is wise, and will keep these things; and will understand the<br>
mercies of the Lord?</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 107</p>

<p>Paratum cor meum.</p>

<p>The prophet praiseth God for benefits received.</p>

<p>107:1. A canticle of a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>107:2. My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and<br>
will give praise, with my glory.</p>

<p>107:3. Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise in the<br>
morning early.</p>

<p>107:4. I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing<br>
unto thee among the nations.</p>

<p>107:5. For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto<br>
the clouds.</p>

<p>107:6. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all<br>
the earth:</p>

<p>107:7. That thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand and<br>
hear me.</p>

<p>107:8. God hath spoken in his holiness. I will rejoice, and I will<br>
divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.</p>

<p>107:9. Galaad is mine: and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection<br>
of my head. Juda is my king:</p>

<p>107:10. Moab the pot of my hope. Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe:<br>
the aliens are become my friends.</p>

<p>107:11. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into<br>
Edom?</p>

<p>107:12. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,<br>
O God, go forth with our armies?</p>

<p>107:13. O grant us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>

<p>107:14. Through God we shall do mightily: and he will bring our enemies<br>
to nothing.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 108</p>

<p>Deus, laudem meam.</p>

<p>David in the person of Christ, prayeth against his persecutors; more<br>
especially the traitor Judas: foretelling and approving his just<br>
punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence.</p>

<p>108:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>108:2. O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the<br>
wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.</p>

<p>108:3. They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have<br>
compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me<br>
without cause.</p>

<p>108:4. Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I<br>
gave myself to prayer.</p>

<p>108:5. And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.</p>

<p>108:6. Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his<br>
right hand.</p>

<p>Set thou the sinner over him, etc... Give to the devil, that arch-<br>
sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The<br>
imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed<br>
to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and<br>
are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should<br>
befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as<br>
curses.</p>

<p>108:7. When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be<br>
turned to sin.</p>

<p>108:8. May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.</p>

<p>108:9. May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>

<p>108:10. Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let<br>
them be cast out of their dwellings.</p>

<p>108:11. May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers<br>
plunder his labours.</p>

<p>108:12. May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless<br>
offspring.</p>

<p>108:13. May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be<br>
blotted out.</p>

<p>108:14. May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of<br>
the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>

<p>108:15. May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of<br>
them perish from the earth: &nbsp;&nbsp;16 &nbsp;because he remembered not to shew<br>
mercy,</p>

<p>108:17. But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in<br>
heart, to put him to death.</p>

<p>108:18. And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would<br>
not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing,<br>
like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like<br>
oil in his bones.</p>

<p>108:19. May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a<br>
girdle with which he is girded continually.</p>

<p>108:20. This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who<br>
speak evils against my soul.</p>

<p>108:21. But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name's sake: because thy<br>
mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,</p>

<p>108:22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.</p>

<p>108:23. I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am<br>
shaken off as locusts.</p>

<p>108:24. My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed<br>
for oil.</p>

<p>For oil... Propter oleum. The meaning is, my flesh is changed, being<br>
perfectly emaciated and dried up, as having lost all its oil or fatness.</p>

<p>108:25. And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked<br>
their heads.</p>

<p>108:26. Help me, O Lord my God; save me; according to thy mercy.</p>

<p>108:27. And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord,<br>
hast done it.</p>

<p>108:28. They will curse and thou wilt bless: let them that rise up<br>
against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.</p>

<p>108:29. Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be<br>
covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.</p>

<p>108:30. I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the<br>
midst of many I will praise him.</p>

<p>108:31. Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my<br>
soul from persecutors.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 109</p>

<p>Dixit Dominus.</p>

<p>Christ's exaltation and everlasting priesthood.</p>

<p>109:1. A psalm for David. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right<br>
hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</p>

<p>109:2. The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion:<br>
rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.</p>

<p>109:3. With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the<br>
brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot<br>
thee.</p>

<p>109:4. The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest<br>
for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>

<p>109:5. The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his<br>
wrath.</p>

<p>109:6. He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush<br>
the heads in the land of many.</p>

<p>109:7. He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift<br>
up the head.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 110</p>

<p>Confitebor tibi, Domine.</p>

<p>God is to be praised for his graces, and benefits to his church.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>110:1. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council<br>
of the just, and in the congregation.</p>

<p>110:2. Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his<br>
wills.</p>

<p>110:3. His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth<br>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>110:4. He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a<br>
merciful and gracious Lord:</p>

<p>110:5. He hath given food to them that fear him. He will be mindful for<br>
ever of his covenant:</p>

<p>110:6. He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.</p>

<p>110:7. That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works<br>
of his hands are truth and judgment.</p>

<p>110:8. All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever,<br>
made in truth and equity.</p>

<p>110:9. He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his<br>
covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name:</p>

<p>110:10. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good<br>
understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and<br>
ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 111</p>

<p>Beatus vir.</p>

<p>The good man is happy.</p>

<p>Alleluia, of the returning of Aggeus and Zacharias.</p>

<p>Of the returning, etc... This is in the Greek and Latin, but not in the<br>
Hebrew. It signifies that this psalm was proper to be sung at the time<br>
of the return of the people from their captivity; to inculcate to them,<br>
how happy they might be, if they would be constant in the service of<br>
God.</p>

<p>111:1. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight<br>
exceedingly in his commandments.</p>

<p>111:2. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the<br>
righteous shall be blessed.</p>

<p>111:3. Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth<br>
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>111:4. To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful,<br>
and compassionate and just.</p>

<p>111:5. Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall<br>
order his words with judgment:</p>

<p>111:6. Because he shall not be moved for ever.</p>

<p>111:7. The just shall be in everlasting remembrance: he shall not fear<br>
the evil hearing. His heart is ready to hope in the Lord:</p>

<p>111:8. His heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look<br>
over his enemies.</p>

<p>111:9. He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice<br>
remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory.</p>

<p>111:10. The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with<br>
his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 112</p>

<p>Laudate, pueri.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>112:1. Praise the Lord, ye children: praise ye the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>112:2. Blessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth now and for<br>
ever. 112:3. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same,<br>
the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>112:4. The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the<br>
heavens.</p>

<p>112:5. Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high: 6 and looketh<br>
down on the low things in heaven and in earth?</p>

<p>112:7. Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out<br>
of the dunghill:</p>

<p>112:8. That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his<br>
people.</p>

<p>112:9. Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother<br>
of children.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 113</p>

<p>In exitu Israel.</p>

<p>God hath shewn his power in delivering his people: idols are vain. The<br>
Hebrews divide this into two psalms.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>113:1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a<br>
barbarous people:</p>

<p>113:2. Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>

<p>113:3. The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.</p>

<p>113:4. The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of<br>
the flock. 113:5. What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and<br>
thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?</p>

<p>113:6. Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs<br>
of the flock?</p>

<p>113:7. At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence<br>
of the God of Jacob:</p>

<p>113:8. Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into<br>
fountains of waters.</p>

<p>113:1. Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.</p>

<p>113:2. For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake: lest the Gentiles should<br>
say: Where is their God?</p>

<p>113:3. But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he<br>
would.</p>

<p>113:4. The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the<br>
hands of men.</p>

<p>113:5. They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not.</p>

<p>113:6. They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not.</p>

<p>113:7. They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not:<br>
neither shall they cry out through their throat.</p>

<p>113:8. Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as<br>
trust in them.</p>

<p>113:9. The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper<br>
and their protector.</p>

<p>113:10. The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper<br>
and their protector.</p>

<p>113:11. They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: he is their<br>
helper and their protector.</p>

<p>113:12. The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath<br>
blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.</p>

<p>113:13. He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.</p>

<p>113:14. May the Lord add blessings upon you: upon you, and upon your<br>
children.</p>

down to hell.</p>

ever.</p>

call upon him.</p>

to thee.</p>

feet from falling.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 118</p>

<p>Beati immaculati.</p>

<p>Of the excellence of virtue consisting in the love and observance of the<br>
commandments of God.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>ALEPH.</p>

<p>Aleph... The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with<br>
Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The<br>
second eight verses begin with Beth, the name of the second letter of<br>
the Hebrew alphabet; and so to the end of the whole alphabet, in all<br>
twenty-two letters, each letter having eight verses. This order is<br>
variously expounded by the holy fathers; which shews the difficulty of<br>
understanding the holy scriptures, and consequently with what humility,<br>
and submission to the Church they are to be read.</p>

<p>118:1. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the<br>
Lord.</p>

<p>118:2. Blessed are they that search his testimonies: that seek him with<br>
their whole heart.</p>

<p>His testimonies... The commandments of God are called his testimonies,<br>
because they testify his holy will unto us. Note here, that in almost<br>
every verse of this psalm (which in number are 176) the word and law of<br>
God, and the love and observance of it, is perpetually inculcated, under<br>
a variety of denominations, all signifying the same thing.</p>

<p>118:3. For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways.</p>

<p>118:4. Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently.</p>

<p>118:5. O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:6. Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:7. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have<br>
learned the judgments of thy justice.</p>

<p>118:8. I will keep thy justifications: O! do not thou utterly forsake<br>
me.</p>

<p>BETH.</p>

<p>
118:9. By what doth a young man correct his way? by observing thy words.</p>

<p>118:10. With my whole heart have I sought after thee: let me not stray<br>
from thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:11. Thy words have I hidden in my heart, that I may not sin against<br>
thee.</p>

<p>118:12. Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:13. With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>

<p>118:14. I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all<br>
riches.</p>

<p>118:15. I will meditate on thy commandments: and I will consider thy<br>
ways.</p>

<p>118:16. I will think of thy justifications: I will not forget thy words.</p>

<p>GIMEL.</p>

<p>118:17. Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: and I shall keep<br>
thy words.</p>

<p>118:18. Open thou my eyes: and I will consider the wondrous things of<br>
thy law.</p>

<p>118:19. I am a sojourner on the earth: hide not thy commandments from<br>
me.</p>

<p>118:20. My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, at all<br>
times.</p>

<p>118:21. Thou hast rebuked the proud: they are cursed who decline from<br>
thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:22. Remove from me reproach and contempt: because I have sought<br>
after thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:23. For princes sat, and spoke against me: but thy servant was<br>
employed in thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:24. For thy testimonies are my meditation: and thy justifications my<br>
counsel.</p>

<p>DALETH.</p>

<p>118:25. My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: quicken thou me according<br>
to thy word.</p>

<p>118:26. I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: teach me thy<br>
justifications.</p>

<p>118:27. Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: and I shall<br>
be exercised in thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>118:28. My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: strengthen thou me in<br>
thy words.</p>

<p>118:29. Remove from me the way of iniquity: and out of thy law have<br>
mercy on me.</p>

<p>118:30. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments I have not<br>
forgotten.</p>

<p>118:31. I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: put me not to shame.</p>

<p>118:32. I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge<br>
my heart.</p>

<p>HE.</p>

<p>118:33. Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord:<br>
and I will always seek after it.</p>

<p>118:34. Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; and I will<br>
keep it with my whole heart.</p>

<p>118:35. Lead me into the path of thy commandments; for this same I have<br>
desired.</p>

<p>118:36. Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness.</p>

<p>118:37. Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in<br>
thy way.</p>

<p>118:38. Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy fear.</p>

<p>118:39. Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: for thy<br>
judgments are delightful.</p>

<p>118:40. Behold I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy<br>
justice.</p>

<p>VAU.</p>

<p>118: 41. Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: thy salvation<br>
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:42. So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; that I<br>
have trusted in thy words.</p>

<p>118:43. And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: for<br>
in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.</p>

<p>118:44. So shall I always keep thy law, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>118:45. And I walked at large: because I have sought after thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:46. And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: and I was not<br>
ashamed.</p>

<p>118:47. I meditated also on thy commandments, which I loved.</p>

<p>118:48. And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: and<br>
I was exercised in thy justifications.</p>

<p>ZAIN.</p>

<p>
118:49. Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, in which thou hast<br>
given me hope.</p>

<p>118:50. This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath<br>
enlivened me.</p>

<p>118:51. The proud did iniquitously altogether: but I declined not from<br>
thy law.</p>

<p>118:52. I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: and I was comforted.</p>

<p>118:53. A fainting hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that<br>
forsake thy law.</p>

<p>118:54. Thy justifications were the subject of my song, in the place of<br>
my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>118:55. In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: and have kept<br>
thy law.</p>

<p>118:56. This happened to me: because I sought after thy justifications.</p>

<p>HETH.</p>

<p>118:57. O Lord, my portion, I have said, I would keep thy law.</p>

<p>118:58. I entreated thy face with all my heart: have mercy on me<br>
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:59. I have thought on my ways: and turned my feet unto thy<br>
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:60. I am ready, and am not troubled: that I may keep thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:61. The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: but I have not<br>
forgotten thy law.</p>

<p>118:62. I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; for the judgments of<br>
thy justification.</p>

<p>118:63. I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, and that keep thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:64. The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy<br>
justifications.</p>

<p>TETH.</p>

<p>
118:65. Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy<br>
word.</p>

<p>118:66. Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; for I have<br>
believed thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:67. Before I was humbled I offended; therefore have I kept thy word.</p>

<p>118:68. Thou art good; and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:69. The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: but I<br>
will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.</p>

<p>118:70. Their heart is curdled like milk: but I have meditated on thy<br>
law.</p>

<p>118:71. It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, that I may learn<br>
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:72. The law of thy mouth is good to me, above thousands of gold and<br>
silver.</p>

<p>JOD.</p>

<p>
118:73. Thy hands have made me and formed me: give me understanding, and<br>
I will learn thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:74. They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: because I<br>
have greatly hoped in thy words.</p>

<p>118:75. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: and in thy truth<br>
thou hast humbled me.</p>

<p>118:76. O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, according to thy word unto<br>
thy servant.</p>

<p>118:77. Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: for thy<br>
law is my meditation.</p>

<p>118:78. Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly<br>
towards me: but I will be employed in thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:79. Let them that fear thee turn to me: and they that know thy<br>
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:80. Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, that I may not<br>
be confounded.</p>

<p>CAPH.</p>

<p>
118:81. My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: and in thy word I have<br>
very much hoped.</p>

<p>118:82. My eyes have failed for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort<br>
me?</p>

<p>118:83. For I am become like a bottle in the frost: I have not forgotten<br>
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:84. How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou execute<br>
judgment on them that persecute me?</p>

<p>118:85. The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law.</p>

<p>118:86. All thy statutes are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly, do<br>
thou help me.</p>

<p>118:87. They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I have not<br>
forsaken thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:88. Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: and I shall keep the<br>
testimonies of thy mouth.</p>

<p>LAMED.</p>

<p>118:89. For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven.</p>

<p>118:90. Thy truth unto all generations: thou hast founded the earth, and<br>
it continueth.</p>

<p>118:91. By thy ordinance the day goeth on: for all things serve thee.</p>

<p>118:92. Unless thy law had been my meditation, I had then perhaps<br>
perished in my abjection.</p>

<p>118:93. Thy justifications I will never forget: for by them thou hast<br>
given me life.</p>

<p>118:94. I am thine, save thou me: for I have sought thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I have<br>
understood thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:96. I have seen an end of all perfection: thy commandment is<br>
exceeding broad.</p>

<p>MEM.</p>

<p>118:97. O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! it is my meditation all the<br>
day.</p>

<p>118:98. Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my<br>
enemies: for it is ever with me.</p>

<p>118:99. I have understood more than all my teachers: because thy<br>
testimonies are my meditation.</p>

<p>118:100. I have had understanding above ancients: because I have sought<br>
thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:101. I have restrained my feet from every evil way: that I may keep<br>
thy words.</p>

<p>118:102. I have not declined from thy judgments, because thou hast set<br>
me a law.</p>

<p>118:103. How sweet are thy words to my palate! more than honey to my<br>
mouth.</p>

<p>118:104. By thy commandments I have had understanding: therefore have I<br>
hated every way of iniquity.</p>

<p>NUN.</p>

<p>118:105. Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.</p>

<p>118:106. I have sworn and am determined to keep the judgments of thy<br>
justice.</p>

<p>118:107. I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: quicken thou me<br>
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:108. The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: and<br>
teach me thy judgments.</p>

<p>118:109. My soul is continually in my hands: and I have not forgotten<br>
thy law.</p>

<p>118:110. Sinners have laid a snare for me: but I have not erred from thy<br>
precepts.</p>

<p>118:111. I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever:<br>
because they are the joy of my heart.</p>

<p>118:112. I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, for<br>
the reward.</p>

<p>SAMECH.</p>

<p>
118:113. I have hated the unjust: and have loved thy law.</p>

<p>118:114. Thou art my helper and my protector: and in thy word I have<br>
greatly hoped.</p>

<p>118:115. Depart from me, ye malignant: and I will search the<br>
commandments of my God.</p>

<p>118:116. Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: and let me<br>
not be confounded in my expectation.</p>

<p>118:117. Help me, and I shall be saved: and I will meditate always on<br>
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:118. Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments;<br>
for their thought is unjust.</p>

<p>118:119. I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators:<br>
therefore have I loved thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:120. Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: for I am afraid of thy<br>
judgments.</p>

<p>AIN.</p>

<p>118:121. I have done judgment and justice: give me not up to them that<br>
slander me.</p>

<p>118:122. Uphold thy servant unto good: let not the proud calumniate me.</p>

<p>118:123. My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: and for the word of<br>
thy justice.</p>

<p>118:124. Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: and teach me thy<br>
justifications.</p>

<p>118:125. I am thy servant: give me understanding that I may know thy<br>
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:126. It is time, O Lord, to do: they have dissipated thy law.</p>

<p>118:127. Therefore have I loved thy commandments above gold and the<br>
topaz.</p>

<p>118:128. Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: I have hated<br>
all wicked ways.</p>

<p>PHE.</p>

<p>
118:129. Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore my soul hath sought<br>
them.</p>

<p>118:130. The declaration of thy words giveth light: and giveth<br>
understanding to little ones.</p>

<p>118:131. I opened my mouth, and panted: because I longed for thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:132. Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me according to the<br>
judgment of them that love thy name.</p>

<p>118:133. Direct my steps according to thy word: and let no iniquity have<br>
dominion over me.</p>

<p>118:134. Redeem me from the calumnies of men: that I may keep thy<br>
commandments.</p>

<p>118:135. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: and teach me thy<br>
justifications.</p>

<p>118:136. My eyes have sent forth springs of water: because they have not<br>
kept thy law.</p>

<p>SADE.</p>

<p>118:137. Thou art just, O Lord: and thy judgment is right.</p>

<p>118:138. Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: and thy truth<br>
exceedingly.</p>

<p>118:139. My zeal hath made me pine away: because my enemies forgot thy<br>
words.</p>

<p>118:140. Thy word is exceedingly refined: and thy servant hath loved it.</p>

<p>118:141. I am very young and despised; but I forget not thy<br>
justifications.</p>

words I very much hoped.</p>

<p>118:148. My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: that I might<br>
meditate on thy words.</p>

declined from thy testimonies.</p>

<p>A gradual canticle.</p>

<p>A gradual canticle... The following psalms, in number fifteen, are<br>
called gradual psalms, or canticles, from the word gradus, signifying<br>
steps, ascensions, or degrees: either because they were appointed to be<br>
sung on the fifteen steps, by which the people ascended to the temple:<br>
or, that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain<br>
steps or ascensions: or, that they were to be sung by the people<br>
returning from their captivity and ascending to Jerusalem, which was<br>
seated amongst mountains. The holy fathers, in a mystical sense,<br>
understand these steps, or ascensions, of the degrees by which<br>
Christians spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection; and to the true<br>
temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

<p>119:1. In my trouble I cried to the Lord: and he heard me.</p>

deceitful tongue?</p>

they fought against me without cause.</p>

David.</p>

<p>121:6. Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: and<br>

<p>123:3. Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was<br>
enkindled against us,</p>

<p>123:4. Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.</p>

sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to<br>

your labour and worldly solicitude, will be vain, that is, will avail<br>
you nothing, without the light, grace, and blessing of God.</p>

be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.</p>

is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul. 130:3. Let Israel<br>

<p>131:1. A gradual canticle. O Lord, remember David, and all his meekness.</p>

<p>131:2. How he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob:</p>

<p>131:3. If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go<br>
up into the bed wherein I lie:</p>

<p>131:4. If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,</p>

<p>131:5. Or rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a<br>
tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>131:6. Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the<br>
fields of the wood.</p>

<p>We have heard of it in Ephrata... When I was young, and lived in<br>
Bethlehem, otherwise called Ephrata, I heard of God's tabernacle and<br>
ark, and had a devout desire of seeking it; and accordingly I found it<br>
at Cariathiarim, the city of the woods: where it was till it was removed<br>
to Jerusalem. See 1 Par. 13.</p>

which I shall teach them: Their children also for evermore shall sit<br>
upon thy throne.</p>

<p>131:13. For the Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for his<br>

for my anointed.</p>

beard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment:</p>

<p>132:3. As the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there<br>

gods.</p>

<p>134:6. Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done, in heaven, in earth, in<br>
the sea, and in all the deeps.</p>

<p>134:7. He bringeth up clouds from the end of the earth: he hath made<br>
lightnings for the rain. He bringeth forth winds out of his stores:</p>

upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.</p>

<p>Super flumina.</p>

<p>The lamentation of the people of God in their captivity in Babylon.</p>

<p>A psalm of David, for Jeremias.</p>

<p>For Jeremias... For the time of Jeremias, and the captivity of Babylon.</p>

<p>136:1. Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept: when we<br>
remembered Sion:</p>

<p>136:2. On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments.</p>

<p>136:3. For there they that led us into captivity required of us the<br>
words of songs. And they that carried us away, said: Sing ye to us a<br>
hymn of the songs of Sion.</p>

<p>136:4. How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land?</p>

<p>136:5. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.</p>

<p>136:6. Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I do not remember thee: If I<br>
make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy.</p>

<p>136:7. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem:<br>
Who say: Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</p>

<p>136:8. O daughter of Babylon, miserable: blessed shall he be who shall<br>
repay thee thy payment which thou hast paid us.</p>

<p>136:9. Blessed be he that shall take and dash thy little ones against<br>
the rock.</p>

<p>Dash thy little ones, etc... In the spiritual sense, we dash the little<br>
ones of Babylon against the rock, when we mortify our passions, and<br>
stifle the first motions of them, by a speedy recourse to the rock which<br>
is Christ.</p>

heart: for thou hast heard the words of my mouth. I will sing praise to<br>
thee in the sight of the angels:</p>

<p>137:2. I will worship towards thy holy temple, and I will give glory to<br>
thy name. For thy mercy, and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy<br>
holy name above all.</p>

<p>137:3. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me: thou shalt<br>
multiply strength in my soul.</p>

<p>137:4. May all the kings of the earth give glory to thee: for they have<br>
heard all the words of thy mouth.</p>

<p>137:5. And let them sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory<br>
of the Lord.</p>

<p>137:6. For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low: and the high he<br>
knoweth afar off.</p>

<p>137:7. If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken<br>
me: and thou hast stretched forth thy hand against the wrath of my<br>
enemies: and thy right hand hath saved me.</p>

<p>137:8. The Lord will repay for me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever:<br>
O despise not the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>Domine, probasti.</p>

<p>God's special providence over his servants.</p>

<p>138:1. Unto the end, a psalm of David. Lord, thou hast proved me, and<br>
known me:</p>

<p>138:2. Thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.</p>

<p>138:3. Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: my path and my line<br>
thou hast searched out.</p>

<p>138:4. And thou hast foreseen all my ways: for there is no speech in my<br>
tongue.</p>

<p>There is no speech, etc... Viz., unknown to thee: or when there is no<br>
speech in my tongue; yet my whole interior and my most secret thoughts<br>
are known to thee.</p>

<p>138:5. Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of<br>
old: thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.</p>

<p>138:6. Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: it is high, and I cannot<br>
reach to it.</p>

<p>138:7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from<br>
thy face?</p>

<p>138:8 &nbsp;If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell,<br>
thou art present.</p>

<p>138:9. If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the<br>
uttermost parts of the sea:</p>

<p>138:10. Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall<br>
hold me.</p>

<p>138:11. And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: and night shall be<br>
my light in my pleasures.</p>

<p>138:12. But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light<br>
all the day: the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to<br>
thee.</p>

<p>138:13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast protected me from my<br>
mother's womb.</p>

<p>138:14. I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: wonderful<br>
are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.</p>

<p>138:15. My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret:<br>
and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.</p>

<p>138:16. Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall<br>
be written: days shall be formed, and no one in them.</p>

<p>138:17. But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable:<br>
their principality is exceedingly strengthened.</p>

<p>138:18. I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand,<br>
I rose up and am still with thee.</p>

<p>138:19. If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: ye men of blood, depart<br>
from me:</p>

<p>138:20. Because you say in thought: They shall receive thy cities in<br>
vain.</p>

<p>Because you say in thought, etc... Depart from me, you wicked, who plot<br>
against the servants of God, and think to cast them out of the cities of<br>
their habitation; as if they have received them in vain, and to no<br>
purpose.</p>

<p>138:21. Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: and pined away<br>
because of thy enemies?</p>

<p>138:22. I have hated them with a perfect hatred: and they are become<br>
enemies to me.</p>

<p>I have hated them... Not with an hatred of malice, but a zeal for the<br>
observance of God's commandments; which he saw were despised by the<br>
wicked, who are to be considered enemies to God.</p>

<p>138:23. Prove me, O God, and know my heart: examine me, and know my<br>
paths.</p>

<p>138:24. And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: and lead me in<br>
the eternal way.</p>

<p>139:2. Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: rescue me from the unjust<br>
man.</p>

<p>139:3. Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: all the day long<br>
they designed battles.</p>

<p>139:4. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the venom of<br>
asps is under their lips.</p>

<p>139:5. Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men<br>
deliver me. Who have proposed to supplant my steps:</p>

<p>139:6. The proud have hidden a net for me. And they have stretched out<br>
cords for a snare: they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the<br>
wayside.</p>

<p>139:7. I said to the Lord: Thou art my God: hear, O Lord, the voice of<br>
my supplication.</p>

<p>139:8. O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: thou hast<br>
overshadowed my head in the day of battle.</p>

<p>139:9. Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked: they have<br>
plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.</p>

<p>139:10. The head of them compassing me about: the labour of their lips<br>
shall overwhelm them.</p>

<p>139:11. Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down<br>
into the fire: in miseries they shall not be able to stand.</p>

<p>139:12. A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth: evil<br>
shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.</p>

<p>139:13. I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, and will<br>
revenge the poor.</p>

<p>139:14. But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name: and the<br>
upright shall dwell with thy countenance.</p>

<p>140:1. I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when<br>
I cry to thee.</p>

<p>140:2. Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up<br>
of my hands, as evening sacrifice.</p>

<p>140:3. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my<br>
lips.</p>

<p>140:4. Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With<br>
men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of<br>
them.</p>

<p>140:5. The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but<br>
let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head. For my prayer shall still<br>
be against the things with which they are well pleased:</p>

<p>Let not the oil of the sinner, etc... That is, the flattery, or<br>
deceitful praise.-Ibid. For my prayer, etc... So far from coveting their<br>
praises, who are never well pleased but with things that are evil; I<br>
shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they are<br>
delighted with.</p>

<p>140:6. Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They<br>
shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:</p>

<p>Their judges, etc... Their rulers, or chiefs, quickly vanish and perish,<br>
like ships dashed against the rocks, and swallowed up by the waves. Let<br>
them then hear my words, for they are powerful and will prevail; or, as<br>
it is in the Hebrew, for they are sweet.</p>

<p>140:7. As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground:<br>
Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.</p>

<p>140:8. But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my<br>
trust, take not away my soul.</p>

<p>140:9. Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the<br>
stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>140:10. The wicked shall fall in his net: I am alone until I pass.</p>

<p>I am alone, etc... Singularly protected by the Almighty, until I pass<br>
all their nets and snares.</p>

supplication to the Lord.</p>

<p>141:3. In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my<br>
trouble:</p>

<p>141:4. When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths. In this way<br>
wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.</p>

<p>141:5. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that<br>
would know me. Flight hath failed me: and there is no one that hath<br>
regard to my soul.</p>

<p>141:6. I cried to thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in<br>
the land of the living.</p>

<p>141:7. Attend to my supplication: for I am brought very low. Deliver me<br>
from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>

<p>141:8. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the just<br>
wait for me, until thou reward me.</p>

Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: hear<br>
me in thy justice.</p>

<p>142:2. And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight no<br>
man living shall be justified.</p>

<p>142:3. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath brought down my<br>
life to the earth. He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that<br>
have been dead of old:</p>

<p>142:4 &nbsp;And my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is<br>
troubled.</p>

<p>142:5. I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: I<br>
meditated upon the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>142:6. I stretched forth my hands to thee: my soul is as earth without<br>
water unto thee.</p>

<p>142:7. Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit hath fainted away. Turn not<br>
away thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the<br>
pit.</p>

<p>142:8. Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee have I<br>
hoped. Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: for I have<br>
lifted up my soul to thee.</p>

<p>142:9. Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled:</p>

<p>142:10. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good spirit<br>
shall lead me into the right land: &nbsp;&nbsp;11 &nbsp;for thy name's sake, O Lord,<br>
thou wilt quicken me in thy justice. Thou wilt bring my soul out of<br>
trouble:</p>

<p>142:12. And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies. And thou wilt cut<br>
off all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>

<p>143:3. Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of<br>
man, that thou makest account of him?</p>

they shall smoke.</p>

arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.</p>

hand of iniquity.</p>

<p>143:9. To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and<br>
an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.</p>

<p>143:10. Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant<br>
David from the malicious sword:</p>

<p>143:11. Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children;<br>
whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand<br>
of iniquity:</p>

<p>143:12. Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters<br>
decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:</p>

<p>143:13. Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their<br>
sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth:</p>

<p>143:14. Their oxen fat. There is no &nbsp;breach of wall, nor passage, nor<br>
crying out in their streets.</p>

<p>143:15. They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but<br>
happy is that people whose God is the Lord.</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE, DOUAY RHEIMS, B21 ***

******* This file should be named drb2110h.htm or drb2110h.zip ********
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, drb2111h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, drb2110ah.htm

This eBook was produced by David Widger

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK

eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
