<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>These papers appeared in the <i>Times of India</i>, and were written,
of course, for the Bombay Presidency; but the Indian <i>Nowker</i> exhibits
very much the same traits wherever he is found and under whatsoever
name.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ENGAGING A BOY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>Extended, six feet of me, over an ample easy-chair, in absolute repose
of mind and body, soothed with a cup of tea which Canjee had ministered
to me, comforted by the slippers which he had put on my feet in place
of a heavy pair of boots which he had unlaced and taken away, feeling
in charity with all mankind&mdash;from this standpoint I began to contemplate
&ldquo;The Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a wonderful provision of nature he is in this half-hatched civilization
of ours, which merely distracts our energies by multiplying our needs
and leaves us no better off than we were before we discovered them!&nbsp;
He seems to have a natural aptitude for discerning, or even inventing,
your wants and supplies them before you yourself are aware of them.&nbsp;
While in his hands nothing petty invades you.&nbsp; Great-mindedness
becomes possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Magnanimus &AElig;neas&rdquo; must have
had an excellent Boy.&nbsp; What is the history of the Boy?&nbsp; How
and where did he originate?&nbsp; What is the derivation of his name?&nbsp;
I have heard it traced to the Hindoostanee word <i>bhai</i>, a brother,
but the usual attitude of the Anglo-Indian&rsquo;s mind towards his
domestics does not give sufficient support to this.&nbsp; I incline
to the belief that the word is of hybrid origin, having its roots in
<i>bhoee</i>, a bearer, and drawing the tenderer shades of its meaning
from the English word which it resembles.&nbsp; To this no doubt may
be traced in part the master&rsquo;s disposition to regard his boy always
as <i>in statu pupillari</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps he carries this view of
the relationship too far, but the Boy, on the other hand, cheerfully
regards him as <i>in loco parentis</i> and accepts much from him which
he will not endure from a stranger.&nbsp; A cuff from his master (delivered
in a right spirit) raises his dignity, but the same from a guest in
the house wounds him terribly.&nbsp; He protests that it is &ldquo;not
regulation.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this happy spirit of filial piety he
will live until his hair grows white and his hand shaky and his teeth
fall out and service gives place to worship, <i>dulia</i> to <i>latria</i>,
and the most revered idol among his <i>penates</i> is the photograph
of his departed master.&nbsp; With a tear in his dim old eye he takes
it from its shrine and unwraps the red handkerchief in which it is folded,
while he tells of the virtues of the great and good man.&nbsp; He says
there are no such masters in these days, and when you reply that there
are no such servants either, he does not contradict you.&nbsp; Yet he
may have been a sad young scamp when he began life as a dog-boy fifty-five
years ago, and, on the other hand, it is not so impossible as it seems
that the scapegrace for whose special behoof you keep a rattan on your
hat-pegs may mellow into a most respectable and trustworthy old man,
at least if he is happy enough to settle under a good master; for the
Boy is often very much a reflection of the master.&nbsp; Often, but
not always.&nbsp; Something depends on the grain of the material.&nbsp;
There are Boys and Boys.&nbsp; There is a Boy with whom, when you get
him, you can do nothing but dismiss him, and this is not a loss to him
only, but to you, for every dismissal weakens your position.&nbsp; A
man who parts lightly with his servants will never have a servant worth
retaining.&nbsp; At the morning conference in the market, where masters
are discussed over the soothing <i>beeree</i>, none holds so low a place
as the <i>saheb</i> who has had eleven butlers in twelve months.&nbsp;
Only loafers will take service with him, and he must pay even them highly.&nbsp;
Believe me, the reputation that your service is permanent, like service
under the <i>Sircar</i>, is worth many rupees a month in India.</p>
<p>The engagement of a first Boy, therefore, is a momentous crisis,
fraught with fat contentment and a good digestion, or with unrest, distraction,
bad temper, and a ruined constitution.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, we
approach this epoch in a condition of original ignorance.&nbsp; There
is not even any guide or handbook of Boys which we may consult.&nbsp;
The Griffin a week old has to decide for himself between not a dozen
specimens, but a dozen types, all strange, and each differing from the
other in dress, complexion, manner, and even language.&nbsp; As soon
as it becomes known that the new <i>saheb</i> from England is in need
of a Boy, the <i>lev&eacute;e</i> begins.&nbsp; First you are waited
upon by a personage of imposing appearance.&nbsp; His broad and dignified
face is ornamented with grey, well-trimmed whiskers.&nbsp; There is
no lack of gold thread on his turban, an ample <i>cumberbund</i> envelopes
his portly figure, and he wears canvas shoes.&nbsp; He left his walking-cane
at the door.&nbsp; His testimonials are unexceptionable, mostly signed
by mess secretaries; and he talks familiarly, in good English, of Members
of Council.&nbsp; Everything is most satisfactory, and you inquire,
timidly, what salary he would expect.&nbsp; He replies that that rests
with your lordship: in his last appointment he had Rs. 35 a month, and
a pony to ride to market.&nbsp; The situation is now very embarrassing.&nbsp;
It is not only that you feel you are in the presence of a greater man
than yourself, but that you know <i>he</i> feels it.&nbsp; By far the
best way out of the difficulty is to accept your relative position,
and tell him blandly that when you are a commissioner <i>saheb</i>,
or a commander-in-chief, he shall be your head butler.&nbsp; He will
understand you, and retire with a polite assurance that that day is
not far distant.</p>
<p>As soon as the result of this interview becomes known, a man of very
black complexion offers his services.&nbsp; He has no shoes or <i>cumberbund</i>,
but his coat is spotlessly white.&nbsp; His certificates are excellent,
but signed by persons whom you have not met or heard of.&nbsp; They
all speak of him as very hard-working and some say he is honest.&nbsp;
His spotless dress will prepossess you if you do not understand it.&nbsp;
Its real significance is that he had to go to the <i>dhobie</i> to fit
himself for coming into your presence.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s expectations
as regards salary are most modest, and you are in much danger of engaging
him, unless the hotel butler takes an opportunity of warning you earnestly
that, &ldquo;This man not gentlyman&rsquo;s servant, sir!&nbsp; He sojer&rsquo;s
servant!&rdquo;&nbsp; In truth, we occupy in India a double social position;
that which belongs to us among our friends, and that which belongs to
us in the market, in the hotel, or at the dinner table, by virtue of
our servants.&nbsp; The former concerns our pride, but the latter concerns
our comfort.&nbsp; Please yourself, therefore, in the choice of your
personal friends and companions, but as regards your servants keep up
your standard.</p>
<p>The next who offers himself will probably be of the Goanese variety.&nbsp;
He comes in a black coat, with continuations of checked jail cloth,
and takes his hat off just before he enters the gate.&nbsp; He is said
to be a Colonel in the Goa Militia, but it is impossible to guess his
rank, as he always wears <i>muftie</i> in Bombay.&nbsp; He calls himself
plain Mr. Querobino Floriano de Braganza.&nbsp; His testimonials are
excellent; several of them say that he is a good tailor, which, to a
bachelor, is a recommendation; and his expectations as regards his stipend
are not immoderate.&nbsp; The only suspicious thing is that his services
have been dispensed with on several occasions very suddenly without
apparent reason.&nbsp; He sheds no light on this circumstance when you
question him, but closer scrutiny of his certificates will reveal the
fact that the convivial season of Christmas has a certain fatality for
him.</p>
<p>When he retires, you may have a call from a fine looking old follower
of the Prophet.&nbsp; He is dressed in spotless white, with a white
turban and white <i>cumberbund</i>; his beard would be as white as either
if he had not dyed it rich orange.&nbsp; He also has lost his place
very suddenly more than once, and on the last occasion without a certificate.&nbsp;
When you ask him the cause of this, he explains, with a certain brief
dignity, in good Hindoostanee, that there was some <i>tukrar</i> (disagreement)
between him and one of the other servants, in which his master took
the part of the other, and as his <i>abroo</i> (honour) was concerned,
he resigned.&nbsp; He does not tell you that the <i>tukrar</i> in question
culminated in his pursuing the cook round the compound with a carving-knife
in his hand, after which he burst into the presence of the lady of the
house, gesticulating with the same weapon, and informed her, in a heated
manner, that he was quite prepared to cut the throats of all the servants,
if honour required it.</p>
<p>If none of the preceding please you, you shall have several varieties
of the Soortee tribe anxious to take service with you; nice looking,
clean men, with fair complexions.&nbsp; There will be the inevitable
unfortunate whose house was burned to ashes two months ago, on which
occasion he lost everything he had, including, of course, all his valuable
certificates.&nbsp; Another will send in a budget dating from the troubled
times of the mutiny.&nbsp; From them it will appear that he has served
in almost every capacity and can turn his hand to anything, is especially
good with children, cooks well, and knows English thoroughly, having
been twice to England with his master.&nbsp; When this desirable man
is summoned into your presence, you cannot help being startled to find
how lightly age sits upon him; he looks like twenty-five.&nbsp; As for
his knowledge of English, it must be latent, for he always falls back
upon his own vernacular for purposes of conversation.&nbsp; You rashly
charge him with having stolen his certificates, but he indignantly repels
the insinuation.&nbsp; You find a discrepancy, however, in the name
and press him still further, whereupon he retires from his first position
to the extent of admitting that the papers, though rightfully his, were
earned by his father.&nbsp; He does not seem to think this detracts
much from their value.&nbsp; Others will come, with less pronounced
characteristics, and, therefore, more perplexing.&nbsp; The Madrassee
will be there, with his spherical turban and his wonderful command of
colloquial English; he is supposed to know how to prepare that mysterious
luxury, &ldquo;real Madras curry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bengal servants are not
common in Bombay, fortunately, for they would only add to the perplexity.&nbsp;
The larger the series of specimens which you examine, the more difficult
it becomes to decide to which of them all you should commit your happiness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Characters&rdquo; are a snare, for the master when parting with
his Boy too often pays off arrears of charity in his certificate; and
besides, the prudent Boy always has his papers read to him and eliminates
anything detrimental to his interests.&nbsp; But there must be marks
by which, if you were to study them closely, you might distinguish the
occult qualities of Boys and divide them into genera and orders.&nbsp;
The subject only wants its Linn&aelig;us.&nbsp; If ever I gird myself
for my <i>magnum opus</i>, I am determined it shall be a &ldquo;Compendious
Guide to the Classification of Indian Boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE BOY AT HOME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Your Boy is your <i>valet de chambre</i>, your butler, your tailor,
your steward and general agent, your interpreter, or oriental translator
and your treasurer.&nbsp; On assuming charge of his duties he takes
steps first, in an unobtrusive way, to ascertain the amount of your
income, both that he may know the measure of his dignity, and also that
he may be able to form an estimate of what you ought to spend.&nbsp;
This is a matter with which he feels he is officially concerned.&nbsp;
Indeed, the arrangement which accords best with his own view of his
position and responsibilities is that, as you draw your salary each
month, you should make it over to him in full.&nbsp; Under this arrangement
he has a tendency to grow rich, and, as a consequence, portly in his
figure and consequential in his bearing, in return for which he will
manage all your affairs without allowing you to be worried by the cares
of life, supply all your wants, keep you in pocket money, and maintain
your dignity on all occasions.&nbsp; If you have not a large enough
soul to consent to this arrangement, he is not discouraged.&nbsp; He
will still be your treasurer, meeting all your petty liabilities out
of his own funds and coming to your aid when you find yourself without
change.&nbsp; As far as my observations go, this is an infallible mark
of a really respectable Boy, that he is never without money.&nbsp; At
the end of the month he presents you a faithful account of his expenditure,
the purport of which is plainly this, that since you did not hand over
your salary to him at the beginning of the month, you are to do so now.&nbsp;
Q.E.F.&nbsp; There is a mystery about these accounts which I have never
been able to solve.&nbsp; The total is always, on the face of it, monstrous
and not to be endured; but when you call your Boy up and prepare to
discharge the bombshell of your indignation, he merely inquires in an
unagitated tone of voice which item you find fault with, and you become
painfully aware that you have not a leg to stand on.&nbsp; In the first
place, most of the items are too minute to allow of much retrenchment.&nbsp;
You can scarcely make sweeping reductions on such charges as:- &ldquo;Butons
for master&rsquo;s trouser, 9 pies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Tramwei for going
to market, 1 anna 6 pies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Grain to sparrow&rdquo; (canary
seed!) &ldquo;1 anna 3 pies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Making white to master&rsquo;s
hat, 5 pies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when at last you find a charge big enough
to lay hold of, the imperturbable man proceeds to explain how, in the
case of that particular item, he was able, by the exercise of a little
forethought, to save you 2 annas and 3 pies.&nbsp; I have struggled
against these accounts and know them.&nbsp; It is vain to be indignant.&nbsp;
You must just pay the bill, and if you do not want another, you must
make up your mind to be your own treasurer.&nbsp; You will fall in your
Boy&rsquo;s estimation, but it does not follow that he will leave your
service.&nbsp; The notion that every native servant makes a principle
of saving the whole of his wages and remitting them monthly to Goa,
or Nowsaree, is one of the ancient myths of Anglo-India.&nbsp; I do
not mean to say that if you encourage your Boy to do this he will refuse;
on the contrary, he likes it.&nbsp; But the ordinary Boy, I believe,
is not a prey to ambition and, if he can find service to his mind, easily
reconciles himself to living on his wages, or, as he terms it, in the
practical spirit of oriental imagery, &ldquo;eating&rdquo; them.&nbsp;
The conditions he values seem to be,&mdash;permanence, respectful treatment,
immunity from kicks and cuffs and from abuse, especially in his own
tongue, and, above all, a quiet life, without <i>kitkit</i>, which may
be vulgarly translated, nagging.&nbsp; He considers his situation with
regard to these conditions, he considers also his pay and prospect of
unjust emoluments, with a judicial mind he balances the one against
the other, and if he works patiently on, it is because the balance is
in his favour.&nbsp; I am satisfied that it is an axiom of domestic
economy in India that the treatment which you mete out to your Boy has
a definite money value.&nbsp; Ill-usage of him is a luxury like any
other, paid for by those who enjoy it, not to be had otherwise.</p>
<p>There is one other thing on which he sets his childish heart.&nbsp;
He likes service with a master who is in some sort a <i>burra saheb</i>.&nbsp;
He is by nature a hero worshipper&mdash;and master is his natural hero.&nbsp;
The saying, that no man is a hero to his own valet, has no application
here.&nbsp; In India, if you are not a hero to your own Boy, I should
say, without wishing to be unpleasant, that the probabilities are against
your being a hero to anybody.&nbsp; It is very difficult for us, with
our notions, to enter into the Boy&rsquo;s beautiful idea of the relationship
which subsists between him and master.&nbsp; To get at it at all we
must realize that no shade of radicalism has ever crossed his social
theory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity&rdquo; is a monstrous
conception, to which he would not open his mind if he could.&nbsp; He
sees that the world contains masters and servants, and doubts not that
the former were provided for the accommodation of the latter.&nbsp;
His fate having made him a servant, his master is the foundation on
which he stands.&nbsp; Everything, therefore, which relates to the well-being,
and especially to the reputation, of his master, is a personal concern
of his own.&nbsp; <i>Per contra</i>, he does not forget that he is the
ornament of his master.&nbsp; I had a Boy once whom I retained chiefly
as a curiosity, for I believe he had the smallest adult human head in
heathendom.&nbsp; He appeared before me one day with that minute organ
surmounted by a gorgeous turban of purple and gold, which he informed
me had cost about a month&rsquo;s pay.&nbsp; Now I knew that his brain
was never equal to the management of his own affairs, so that he was
always in pecuniary straits, but he anticipated my curiosity by informing
me that he had raised the necessary funds by pawning his wife&rsquo;s
bangles.&nbsp; Unthinkingly I reproached him, and then I saw, coming
over his countenance, the bitter expression of one who has met with
rebuff when he looked for sympathy.&nbsp; Arranging himself in his proudest
attitude, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Saheb, is it not for your glory?&nbsp;
When strangers see me will they not ask, &lsquo;Whose servant is that?&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Living always under the influence of this spirit, the Boy never loses
an opportunity of enforcing your importance, and his own as your representative.&nbsp;
When you are staying with friends, he gives the butler notice of your
tastes.&nbsp; If tea is made for breakfast, he demands coffee or cocoa;
if jam is opened, he will try to insist upon marmalade.&nbsp; At an
hotel he orders special dishes.&nbsp; When you buy a horse or a carriage,
he discovers defects in it, and is gratified if he can persuade you
to return it and let people see that you are not to be imposed upon
or trifled with.&nbsp; He delights to keep creditors and mean men waiting
at the door until it shall be your pleasure to see them.&nbsp; But it
is only justice to say that it will be your own fault if this disposition
is not tempered with something of a purer feeling, a kind of filial
regard and even reverence&mdash;if reverence is at all possible&mdash;under
the influence of which he will take a kindly interest in your health
and comfort.&nbsp; When your wife is away, he seems to feel a special
responsibility, and my friend&rsquo;s Boy, when warning his master against
an unwholesome luxury, would enforce his words with the gentle admonition,
&ldquo;Missis never allowing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this way of regarding himself and his master which makes the
Boy generally such a faithful servant; but he often has a sort of spurious
conscience, too, growing out of the fond pride with which he cherishes
his good name, so that you do not strain the truth to say that he is
strictly honest.&nbsp; Veracity is the point on which he is weakest,
but even in this there are exceptions.&nbsp; My last Boy was curiously
scrupulous about the truth, and would rarely tell a lie, even to shield
himself from blame, though he would do so to get the <i>hamal</i> into
a scrape.</p>
<p>I regret to say that the Boy has flaws.&nbsp; His memory is a miracle;
but just once in a way, when you are dining at the club, he lays out
your clothes nicely without a collar.&nbsp; He sends you off on an excursion
to Matheran, and packs your box in his neat way; but instead of putting
one complete sleeping suit, he puts in the upper parts of two, without
the nether and more necessary portions.&nbsp; It is irritating to discover,
when you are dressing in a hurry, that he has put your studs into the
upper flap of your shirt front; but I am not sure it does not try your
patience more to find out, as you brush your teeth, that he has replenished
your tooth-powder box from a bottle of Gregory&rsquo;s mixture.&nbsp;
But Dhobie day is his opportunity.&nbsp; He first delivers the soiled
clothes by tale, diving into each pocket to see if you have left rupees
in it; but he sends a set of studs to be washed.&nbsp; Then he sits
down to execute repairs.&nbsp; He has an assorted packet of metal and
cotton buttons beside him, from which he takes at random.&nbsp; He finishes
with your socks, which he skilfully darns with white thread, and contemplates
the piebald effect with much satisfaction; after which he puts them
up in little balls, each containing a pair of different colours.&nbsp;
Finally he will arrange all the clean clothes in the drawer on a principle
of his own, the effect of which will find its final development in your
temper when you go in haste for a handkerchief.&nbsp; I suspect there
is often an explanation of these things which we do not think of.&nbsp;
The poor Boy has other things on his mind besides your clothes.&nbsp;
He has a wife, or two, and children, and they are not with him.&nbsp;
His child sickens and dies, or his wife runs away with someone else,
and carries off all the jewellery in which he invested his savings;
but he goes about his work in silence, and we only remark that he has
been unusually stupid the last few days.</p>
<p>So much for the Boy in general.&nbsp; As for your own particular
Boy, he must be a very exceptional specimen if he has not persuaded
you long since that, though Boys in general are a rascally lot, you
have been singularly fortunate in yours.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE DOG-BOY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In Bombay it is not enough to fit yourself with a Boy: your dog requires
a Boy too.&nbsp; I have always felt an interest in the smart little
race of Bombay dog-boys.&nbsp; As a corps, they go on with little change
from year to year, but individually they are of short duration, and
the question naturally arises, What becomes of them all when they outgrow
their dog-boyhood?&nbsp; From such observations as I have been able
to make, I believe the dog-boy is not a species by himself, but represents
the early, or larva, stage of several varieties of domestic servants.&nbsp;
The clean little man, in neat print jacket and red velveteen cap, is
the young of a butler; while another, whom nothing can induce to keep
himself clean, would probably, if you reared him, turn into a <i>ghorawalla</i>.&nbsp;
There are others, in appearance intermediate, who are the offspring
of <i>hamals</i> and <i>mussals</i>.&nbsp; These at a later stage become
<i>coolies</i>, going to market in the morning, fetching ice and soda-water,
and so on, until they mature into <i>hamals</i> and <i>mussals</i> themselves.&nbsp;
Like all larv&aelig;, dog-boys eat voraciously and grow rapidly.&nbsp;
You engage a little fellow about a cubit high, and for a time he does
not seem to change at all; then one morning you notice that his legs
have come out half a yard or more from his pantaloons, and soon your
bright little page is a gawky, long-limbed lout, who comes to ask for
leave that he may go to his country and get married.&nbsp; If you do
not give it he will take it, and no doubt you are well rid of him, for
the intellect in these people ripens about the age of fourteen or fifteen,
and after that the faculty of learning anything new stops, and general
intelligence declines.&nbsp; At any rate, when once your boy begins
to grow long and weedy, his days as a dog-boy are ended.&nbsp; He will
pass through a chrysalis stage in his country, or somewhere else, and
after a time emerge in his mature form, in which he will still remember
you, and <i>salaam</i> to you when he meets you on the road.&nbsp; If
he left your service in disgrace, he is so much the more punctilious
in observing this ceremony, which is not an expression of gratitude,
but merely an assertion of his right to public recognition at your hands,
as one who had the honour of eating your salt.&nbsp; I am certain an
Oriental <i>salaam</i> is essentially a claim rather than a tribute.&nbsp;
For this reason your peons, as they stand in line to receive you at
your office door, are very careful not to <i>salaam</i> all at once,
lest you might think one promiscuous recognition sufficient for all.&nbsp;
The havildar, or naik, as is his right, salutes first, and then the
rest follow with sufficient interval to allow you to recognise each
one separately.&nbsp; I have met some men with such lordly souls that
they would not condescend to acknowledge the salutations of menials;
but you gain nothing by this kind of pride in India.&nbsp; They only
conclude that you are not an <i>asl</i>, or born, <i>saheb</i>, and
rejoice that at any rate you cannot take away their right to do obeisance
to you.&nbsp; And you cannot.&nbsp; Your very <i>bhunghie</i> does you
a pompous salutation in public places, and you have no redress.</p>
<p>The dog-boy&rsquo;s primary duties are to feed, tend and wash his
charge, and to take it for a walk morning and evening; but he is active
and very acute, and many other duties fall naturally to him.&nbsp; It
seems hard that he should come under the yoke so early, but we must
not approach such subjects with Western ideas.&nbsp; The exuberant spirits
of boyhood are not indigenous to this country, and the dog-boy has none
of them.&nbsp; He never does mischief for mischief&rsquo;s sake; he
robs no bird&rsquo;s nest; he feels no impulse to trifle with the policeman.&nbsp;
Marbles are his principal pastime.&nbsp; He puts the thumb of his left
hand to the ground and discharges his taw from the point of his second
finger, bending it back till it touches the back of the hand and then
letting it off like a steel spring.&nbsp; Then he follows up on all
fours, with the action of a monsoon frog in pursuit of a fugitive ant.&nbsp;
But liberty and the pride of an independent position amply compensate
any high-souled dog-boy for the loss of his few amusements.</p>
<p>I have said that the dog-boy never does mischief for its own sake.&nbsp;
He would as soon do his duty for its own sake.&nbsp; The motive is not
sufficient.&nbsp; You shall not find him refusing to do any mischief
which tends to his own advantage.&nbsp; I grieve to say it, for I have
leanings towards the dog-boy, but there is in him a vein of unsophisticated
depravity, which issues from the rock of his nature like a clear spring
that no stirrings of conscience or shame have rendered turbid.&nbsp;
His face, it is simple and childlike, and he has the most innocent eye,
but he tells any lie which the occasion demands with a freedom from
embarrassment which at a later age will be impossible to him.&nbsp;
He stands his ground, too, under any fire of cross-examination.&nbsp;
The rattan would dislodge him, but unfortunately his guileless countenance
too often shields him from this searching and wholesome instrument.&nbsp;
When he is sent for a hack buggy and returns after half-an-hour, with
a perplexed face, saying that there is not one to be had anywhere, who
would suspect that he has been holding an auction at the nearest stand,
dwelling on the liberality and wealth of his master and the distance
to which his business that morning will take him, and that, when he
found no one would bid up to his reserve, he remained firm and came
away.&nbsp; Perhaps I seem hard on the dog-boy, but my experience has
not been a happy one.&nbsp; My first seemed to be an average specimen,
moderately clean and well-behaved; but he was not satisfied with his
wages.&nbsp; He assured me that they did not suffice to fill his stomach.&nbsp;
I told him that I thought it would be his father&rsquo;s duty for some
years yet to feed and clothe him, but his young face grew very sad and
he answered softly, &ldquo;I have no father.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I took
pity on him and raised his pay, at the same time assuring him that,
if he behaved himself, I would take care of him.&nbsp; His principal
duty was to take the faithful Hubshee for a walk morning and evening,
and when he returned he would tell me where he had gone and how he had
avoided consorting with other dog-boys and their dogs.&nbsp; When matters
had gone on in this satisfactory way for some time, I happened to take
an unusual walk one evening, and I came suddenly on a company of very
lively little boys engaged in a most exciting game.&nbsp; Their shouts
and laughter mingled with the doleful howls of a dozen dogs which were
closely chained in a long row to a railing, and among them I had no
difficulty in recognising my Hubshee.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that my
dog-boy returned next day to his father, who proved to be in service
next door.&nbsp; He was succeeded by a smart little fellow, well-dressed
and scrupulously clean, but quite above his profession.&nbsp; It seemed
absurd to expect him to wash a dog, so, on the demise of his grandmother,
or some other suitable occasion, he left me to find more congenial service
elsewhere as a dressing-boy.&nbsp; My next was a charity boy, the son
of an ancient <i>ghorawalla</i>.&nbsp; His father had been a faithful
servant, and as regards domestic discipline, no one could say he spared
the rod and spoiled the child.&nbsp; On the contrary, as Shelley, I
think, expresses it,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;He spoilt the rod and did not spare the child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But if my last Boy had been above his work, this one proved to be
below it.&nbsp; You could not easily have disinfected any dog which
he had been allowed to handle.&nbsp; I tried to cure him, but nothing
short of boiling in dilute carbolic acid would have purified him, and
even then the effect would, I feel sure, have been only temporary.&nbsp;
So he returned to his stable litter and I engaged another.&nbsp; This
was a sturdy little man, with a fine, honest-looking face.&nbsp; He
had a dash of Negro blood in him, and wore a most picturesque head-dress.&nbsp;
In fact I felt that, &aelig;sthetically, he raised the tone of my house.&nbsp;
He was hardworking, too, and would do anything he was told, so that
I seemed to have nothing to wish for now but that he might not grow
old too soon.&nbsp; But, alas!&nbsp; I started on an excursion one night,
leaving him in charge of my birds.&nbsp; He promised to attend to them
faithfully, and having seen me off, started on an excursion of his own,
from which he did not get back till three o&rsquo;clock next day.&nbsp;
I arrived at the same moment and he saw me.&nbsp; Quick as thought he
raced upstairs, flung the windows open and began to pull the covers
off the bird-cages; but I came in before the operation could be finished.&nbsp;
In the interests of common morality I thought it best to eject him from
the premises before he had time to frame a lie.&nbsp; About a week after
this I received a petition, signed with his mark, recounting his faithful
services, expressing his surprise and regret at the sudden and unprovoked
manner in which I had dismissed him, and insinuating that some enemy
or rival had poisoned my benevolent mind against him.&nbsp; He concluded
by demanding satisfaction.&nbsp; I wonder what has become of him since.</p>
<p>I have said that there is a vein of depravity in the dog-boy, but
there must be a compensating vein of worth of some kind, an Ormuzd which
in the end often triumphs over Ahriman.&nbsp; The influences among which
he developes do little for him.&nbsp; At home he is certainly subject
to a certain rugged discipline; his mother throws stones at him when
she is angry, and his father, when he can catch him, gives him a cudgeling
to be remembered.&nbsp; But when he leaves the parental roof he passes
from all this and is left to himself.&nbsp; Some masters treat him in
a parental spirit and chastise him when he deserves it, and the Boy
tyrannizes over him and twists his ear, but on the whole he grows as
a tree grows.&nbsp; And yet how often he matures into a most respectable
and trustworthy man!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE GHORAWALLA, OR SYCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A Boy for yourself, a boy for your dog, then a man for your horse;
that is the usual order of trouble.&nbsp; Of course the horse itself
precedes the horse-keeper, but then I do not reckon the buying of a
horse among life&rsquo;s troubles, rather among its luxuries.&nbsp;
It combines all the subtle pleasures of shopping with a turbid excitement
which is its own.&nbsp; From the moment when you first start from the
breakfast-table at the sound of hoofs, and find the noble animal at
the door, arching his neck and champing his bit, as if he felt proud
to bear that other animal, bandy-legged, mendacious, and altogether
ignoble who sits jauntily on his back, down to the moment when you walk
round to the stable for a little quiet enjoyment of the sense of ownership,
there is a high tide of mental elation running through the days.&nbsp;
Then the <i>Ghorawalla</i> supervenes.</p>
<p>The first symptom of him is an indent for certain articles which
he asserts to be absolutely necessary before he can enter on his professional
duties.&nbsp; These are a <i>jhule</i>, <i>baldee</i>, <i>tobra</i>,
<i>mora</i>, <i>booroos</i>, <i>bagdoor</i>, <i>agadee</i>, <i>peechadee</i>,
<i>curraree</i>, <i>hathalee</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; It is not very rational
to be angry, for most of the articles, if not all, are really required.&nbsp;
Several of them, indeed, are only ropes, for the <i>Ghorawalla</i>,
or syce, as they call him on the other side of India, gives every bit
of cordage about his beast a separate name, as a sailor describes the
rigging of a ship.&nbsp; But the fact remains that there is something
peculiarly irritating in this first indent.&nbsp; Perhaps one feels,
after buying and paying for a whole horse, that he might in decency
have been allowed to breathe before being asked to pay again.&nbsp;
If this is it, the sooner the delusion is dissipated the better.&nbsp;
You will never have respite from payments while an active-minded syce
remains on your staff.&nbsp; You think you have fitted him out with
everything the heart of syce can desire, and he goes away seemingly
happy, and commences work at once, hissing like twenty biscobras as
he throws himself against the horse, and works his arms from wrist to
elbow into its ribs.&nbsp; It looks as if it would like to turn round
and take a small piece out of his hinder parts with its teeth, but its
nose is tied up to the roof of the stable, and its hind feet are pulled
out and tied to a peg behind it, so that it can only writhe and cultivate
that amiable temper which characterizes so many horses in this country.&nbsp;
And the syce is happy; but his happiness needs constant sustenance.&nbsp;
Next morning he is at the door with a request for an anna to buy oil.&nbsp;
Horses in this country cannot sleep without a night-light.&nbsp; They
are afraid of rats, I suppose, like ladies.&nbsp; However, it is a small
demand; all the syce&rsquo;s demands are small, so are mosquitoes.&nbsp;
Next day he again wants an anna for oil, but this has nothing to do
with the other.&nbsp; Yesterday&rsquo;s was one sort of oil for burning,
this is another sort of oil for cleaning the bits.&nbsp; To-morrow he
will require a third sort of oil for softening the leather nose-bag,
and the oils of the country will not be exhausted then.&nbsp; Among
the varied street-cries of Bombay, the &ldquo;<i>I-scream</i>&rdquo;
man, the <i>tala-chavee-walla</i>, the <i>botlee-walla</i>, the vendors
of greasy sweetmeats and <i>bawlee-sugah</i>, the legion of <i>borahs</i>,
and that abominable little imp who issues from the newspaper offices,
and walks the streets, yelling &ldquo;Telleecram! tellee-c-r-a-a-m!&rdquo;
among them all there is one voice so penetrating, and so awakening where
it penetrates, that&mdash;that I cannot find a fitting conclusion to
this sentence.&nbsp; Who of us has not started at that shrill squeal
of pain, &ldquo;Nee-ee-ee-ttile!&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Ghorawalla</i>
watches for it, and stopping the good-natured woman, brings her in and
submits a request for a bottle of neat&rsquo;s foot oil, for want of
which your harness is going to destruction.&nbsp; She has blacking as
well as oil, but he will call her in for that afterwards.&nbsp; He never
concludes two transactions in one day.&nbsp; When he has succeeded in
reducing you to such a state of irritability that it is not safe to
mention money in your presence, he stops at once and changes tactics.&nbsp;
He brings the horse to the door with a thick layer of dust on the saddle
and awaits your onset with the intrepid inquiry, &ldquo;Can a saddle
be kept clean without soap?&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose a time will come
when he will have got every article he can possibly use, and it is natural
to hope that he will then be obliged to leave you.&nbsp; But this also
is a delusion.&nbsp; On the contrary, his resources only begin to develop
themselves when he has got all he wants.&nbsp; First one of the leather
things on the horse&rsquo;s hind feet gives way and has to be cobbled,
then a rope wears out and must be replaced, then a buckle gets loose
and wants a stitch.&nbsp; But his chief reliance is on the headstall
and the nose-bag.&nbsp; When these have got well into use, one or other
of them may be counted on to give way about every other day, and when
nothing of the original article is left, the patches of which it is
composed keep on giving way.&nbsp; Each repair costs from one to three
pice, and it puzzles one to conceive what benefit a well-paid groom
can derive from being the broker in such petty transactions.&nbsp; But
all the details of life in this country are microscopical, not only
among the poor, but among those whose business is conducted in lakhs.&nbsp;
I have been told of a certain well-known, wealthy mill-owner who, when
a water Brahmin at a railway station had supplied him and all his attendants
with drinking-water, was seen to fumble in his waistband, and reward
the useful man with one copper pie.&nbsp; A pie at present rates of
exchange is worth about 47/128 of a farthing, and it is instructive
to note that emergency, when it came, found this Cr&oelig;sus provided
with such a coin.</p>
<p>Now it is evident that if the syce can extort two pice from you for
repairs and get the work done for five pies, one clear pie will adhere
to his glutinous palm.&nbsp; I do not assert that this is what happens,
for I know nothing about it.&nbsp; All I maintain is that there is no
hypothesis which will satisfactorily explain all the facts, unless you
admit the general principle that the syce derives advantage of some
kind from the manipulation of the smallest copper coin.&nbsp; One notable
phenomenon which this principle helps to explain is the syce&rsquo;s
anxiety to have his horse shod on the due date every month.&nbsp; If
the shoes are put on so atrociously that they stick for more than a
month, I suspect he considers it professional to help them off.</p>
<p>Horses in this country are fed mostly on &ldquo;gram,&rdquo; <i>cicer
arietinum</i>, a kind of pea, which, when split, forms <i>dall</i>,
and can be made into a most nutritious and palatable curry.&nbsp; The
<i>Ghorawalla</i> recognises this fact.&nbsp; If he is modest, you may
be none the wiser, perhaps none the worse; but if he is not, then his
horse will grow lean, while he grows stout.&nbsp; How to obviate this
result is indeed the main problem which the syce presents, and many
are the ways in vogue of trying to solve it.&nbsp; One way is to have
the horse fed in your presence, you doing butler and watching him feed.&nbsp;
Another is to play upon the caste feelings of the syce, defiling the
horse&rsquo;s food in some way.&nbsp; I believe the editor of the <i>Aryan
Trumpet</i> considers this a violation of the Queen&rsquo;s proclamation,
and, in any case, it is a futile device.&nbsp; It may work with the
haughty <i>Purdaisee</i>, but suppose your <i>Ghorawalla</i> is a <i>Mahar</i>,
whose caste is a good way below that of his horse?&nbsp; I have nothing
to do with any of these devices.&nbsp; I establish a compact with my
man, the unwritten conditions of which are, that I pay him his wages,
and supply a proper quantity of provender, while he, on his part, must
see that his horse is always fat enough to work, and himself lean enough
to run.&nbsp; If he cannot do this, I propose to find someone who can.&nbsp;
Once he comes to a clear understanding of this treaty, and especially
of its last clause, he will give little trouble.&nbsp; As some atonement
for worrying you so much about the accoutrements, the <i>Ghorawalla</i>
is very careful not to disturb you about the horse.&nbsp; If the saddle
galls it, or its hoof cracks, he suppresses the fact, and experiments
upon the ailment with his own &ldquo;vernacular medicines,&rdquo; as
the Baboo called them.&nbsp; When these fail, and the case is almost
past cure, he mentions it casually, as an unfortunate circumstance which
has come to his notice.&nbsp; There are a few things, only a few, which
make me feel homicidal, and this is one of them.</p>
<p>I cannot find the bright side of the syce: perhaps I am not in a
humour to see it.&nbsp; Looking back down a long avenue of Gunnoos,
Tookarams, Raghoos, Mahadoos and others whose names even have grown
dim, I discern only a monotony of provocation.&nbsp; The fine figure
of old Bindaram stands out as an exception, but then he was a coachman,
and the coachman is to the <i>Ghorawalla</i>, what cream is to skim
milk.&nbsp; The unmitigated <i>Ghorawalla</i> is a sore disease, one
of those forms of suffering which raise the question whether our modern
civilization is anything but a great spider, spinning a web of wants
and their accompanying worries over the world and entangling us all,
that it may suck our life-blood out.&nbsp; In justice I will admit that,
as a runner, the thoroughbred Mahratta <i>Ghorawalla</i> has no peer
in the animal kingdom.&nbsp; A sporting friend and I once engaged in
a steeple-chase with two of them.&nbsp; I was mounted on a great Cape
horse, my friend on a wiry countrybred, and the men on their own proper
legs, curious looking limbs without any flesh on them, only shiny black
leather stretched over bones.&nbsp; The goal was <i>bakshees</i>, twelve
miles away.&nbsp; The ground at first favoured them, consisting of rice
fields, along the <i>bunds</i> of which they ran like cats on a wall.&nbsp;
Then we came to more open country and got well ahead, but at the last
mile they put on the most splendid spurt I ever saw, and won by a hundred
lengths.</p>
<p>It is also only justice to say that we do not give the <i>Ghorawalla</i>
fair play.&nbsp; We artificialise him, dress him according to our tastes,
conform him to our notions, cramp his ingenuity, and quench his affections.&nbsp;
The <i>Ghorawalla</i> in his native state is no more like our domesticated
Pandoo than the wild ass of Cutch is like the costermonger&rsquo;s moke.&nbsp;
We will have him like our own saddlery, plain and businesslike, but
he is by nature like his national horse gear, ornamental, and if you
let him alone, will effloresce in a red <i>fez</i> cap, with tassel,
and a waistcoat of green baize.&nbsp; In such a guise he feels worthy
to tend a piebald horse, caparisoned in crimson silk, with a tight martingale
of red and yellow cord.&nbsp; He can take an interest in such a horse,
and will himself educate it to walk on its hind legs and paw the air
with its forefeet, or to progress at a royal amble, lifting both feet
on one side at the same time, so that its body moves as steadily as
if on wheels, and, to use the expressive language of a Brahmin friend
of mine, the water in your stomach is not shaken.&nbsp; He will feed
it with balls of <i>ghee</i> and <i>jagree</i>, that it may become rotund
and sleek, he will shampoo its legs after hard work, and address it
as &ldquo;my son.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it is disobedient, he will chastise
it by plunging his knee into his stomach, and if it acquits itself well,
he will plait its mane and dye the tip of its tail magenta.&nbsp; This
loving relationship between him and his beast extends even to religion,
and the horse enjoys the Hindoo festivals.&nbsp; During the Dussera
it does not work, but comes to the door, festooned with garlands of
marigold, and expects a rupee.</p>
<p>The coachman is to the <i>Ghorawalla</i> what cream is to skim milk,
that is if you consider his substance.&nbsp; As regards his art he is
a foreign product altogether, and I take little interest in him.&nbsp;
There is an indigenous art of driving in this country, the driving of
the bullock, but that is a great subject.</p>

<h2>BOOTLAIR SAHEB&mdash;ANGLIC&Egrave;, THE BUTLER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Some dogs, when they hear a fiddle, are forced to turn over on their
backs and howl; some are unmoved by music.&nbsp; So some men are tortured
by every violation of symmetry, while some cannot discern a straight
line.&nbsp; I belong to the former class, and my Butler belongs to the
latter.&nbsp; He <i>would</i> lay the table in a way which almost gave
me a crick in neck, and certainly dislocated my temper, and he would
not see that there was anything wrong.&nbsp; I reasoned with him, for
he is an intelligent man.&nbsp; I pointed out to him, in his own vernacular,
that the knives and forks were not parallel, that the four dishes formed
a trapezium, and that the cruet, taken with any two of the salt cellars,
made a scalene triangle; in short, that there was not one parallelogram,
or other regular figure, on the table.&nbsp; At last a gleam of light
passed over his countenance.&nbsp; Yes, he understood it all; it was
very simple; henceforth I should find everything straight.&nbsp; And
here is the result!&nbsp; He has arranged everything with the utmost
regularity, guiding himself by the creases in the tablecloth; but, unfortunately,
he began by laying the cloth itself slantwise; consequently, I find
myself with my back to one corner of the room and my face to another,
and cannot get rid of the feeling that everything on the table is slightly
the worse for liquor.&nbsp; And the Butler is in despair.&nbsp; What
on earth, he thinks, can be wrong now?&nbsp; He evidently gives it up,
and so do I.</p>
<p>I have already treated of the Boy, and to devote another chapter
to the Butler may seem like making a distinction where there is no difference;
but there is in reality a radical difference between the two offices,
which is this, that your Boy looks after you, whereas your Butler looks
after the other servants, and you look after him; at least, I hope you
do.&nbsp; From this it follows that the Boy flourishes only in the free
atmosphere of bachelordom.&nbsp; If master marries, the Boy sometimes
becomes a Butler, but I have generally seen that the change was fatal
to him.&nbsp; He feels a share at first in master&rsquo;s happiness
on the auspicious occasion, and begins to fit on his new dignity.&nbsp;
He provides himself with a more magnificent <i>cumberbund</i>, enlarges
the border of gold thread on his puggree, and furbishes up his English
that he may converse pleasantly with <i>mem saheb</i>.&nbsp; He orders
about the other servants with a fuller voice than before, and when anyone
calls for a chair, he no longer brings one himself, but commands the
<i>hamal</i> to do so.&nbsp; He feels supremely happy!&nbsp; Alas! before
the <i>mem saheb</i> has been many weeks in the house, the change of
air begins to disagree with him&mdash;not with his body, but with his
spirit, and though he may bear up against it for a time, he sooner or
later asks leave to go to his country.&nbsp; His new mistress is nothing
loth to be rid of him, nor master either, for even his countenance is
changed; and so the Butler&rsquo;s brief reign comes to an end, and
he departs, deploring the unhappy match his master has made.&nbsp; Why
could not so liberal and large-minded a <i>saheb</i> remain unmarried,
and continue to cast the shadow of his benevolence on those who were
so happy as to eat his salt, instead of taking to himself a <i>madam</i>,
under whom there is no peace night or day?&nbsp; As he sits with his
unemployed friends seeking the consolation of the never-failing <i>beeree</i>,
the ex-butler narrates her ladyship&rsquo;s cantankerous ways, how she
eternally fidgeted over a little harmless dust about the corners of
the furniture, as if it was not the nature of dust to settle on furniture;
how she would have window panes washed which had never been washed before;
her meanness in inquiring about the consumption of oil and milk and
firewood, matters which the <i>saheb</i> had never stooped to look into;
and her unworthy and insulting practice of locking up stores, and doling
them out day by day, not to mention having the cow milked in her presence:
all which made him so ashamed in the presence of the other servants
that his life became bitter, and he was forced to ask for his <i>ruzza.</i></p>
<p>Lalla, sitting next to him, remarks that no doubt one person is of
one disposition and another of another disposition.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
it had been my destiny to remain in the service of Colonel Balloonpeel,
all my days would have passed in peace; but he went to England when
he got his <i>pencil</i>.&nbsp; Who can describe the calmness and goodness
of his <i>madam</i>.&nbsp; She never asked a question.&nbsp; She put
the keys in the Butler&rsquo;s hand, and if he asked for money she gave
it.&nbsp; But one person is of one disposition and another is of another
disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replies the ex-butler, &ldquo;but the
<i>sahebs</i> are better than the <i>mem sahebs</i>.&nbsp; The <i>sahebs</i>
are hot and get angry sometimes, but under them a man can live and eat
a mouthful of bread.&nbsp; With the <i>mem sahebs</i> it is nothing
but worry, worry, worry.&nbsp; Why is this so dirty?&nbsp; Who broke
that plate?&nbsp; When was that glass cracked?&nbsp; Alas! why do the
<i>sahebs</i> marry such women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Ramjee then withdraws his <i>beeree</i> from his mouth and sheds
light on the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, in England there are very
few women, for which reason it is that so many <i>sahebs</i> remain
unmarried.&nbsp; So when a <i>saheb</i> goes home to his country for
a wife, he must take what he can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a question of destiny,&rdquo; says Lalla, &ldquo;with
them and with us.&nbsp; My first wife, who can tell how meek she was?&nbsp;
She never opened her mouth.&nbsp; My present wife is such a <i>sheitan</i>
that a man cannot live under the same roof with her.&nbsp; I have sent
her to her country ten times, but what is the use?&nbsp; Will she stay
there?&nbsp; The flavour has all gone out of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they all make noises expressive of sympathy.</p>
<p>The Butler being commander-in-chief of the household forces, I find
one quality to be indispensable in him, and that is what the natives
call <i>hookoomut</i>, the faculty of so commanding that other men obey.&nbsp;
He has to control a sneaking <i>mussaul</i>, an obstinate <i>hamal</i>,
a quarrelsome, or perhaps a drunken cook, a wicked dog-boy, a proud
coachman, and a few turbulent <i>ghorawallas</i>, while he must conciliate,
or outwit, the opposition headed by the <i>ayah</i>.&nbsp; If he cannot
do this there will be factions, seditions, open mutiny, ending in appeals
to you, to which if you give ear, you will foster all manner of intrigue,
and put a premium on lies and hypocrisy; and it will be strange if you
do not end by punishing the innocent and filling the guilty with unholy
joy.&nbsp; In this country there is only one way of dealing with the
squabbles of domestics and dependents, and that is the method of Gallio,
who was a great man.</p>
<p>Besides the general responsibilities of his position as C.-in-C.,
the Butler has certain specific duties, such as to stand with arms folded
behind you at meal time, to clean the silver, and to go to the bazaar
in the morning.&nbsp; The last seems to be quite as much a prerogative
as a duty, and the cook wants to go to law about it, regarding the Butler
as an unlawful usurper.&nbsp; He asserts his claim by spoiling the meat
which the Butler brings.&nbsp; Of course, there must be some reason
why this duty, or privilege, is so highly valued, and no doubt that
reason is connected with the great Oriental principle, that of everything
a man handles or controls, somewhat should adhere to his palm; but if
you ask how this principle is applied or worked out, I can only reply
that that is a matter on which I believe not one of us has any information,
though for the most part we hold very emphatic opinions on the subject.&nbsp;
I am quite certain that it may be laid down for a general rule that
the Butler prefers indirect to direct taxation.&nbsp; He certainly would
not reduce salt and customs duties to pave the way for an income tax.&nbsp;
Neither would a Viceroy, perhaps, if he had to stay and reap the fruit
of his works, instead of leaving that to his successor&mdash;but that
is political reflection which has no business here.&nbsp; The Butler,
I say, wisely prefers indirect taxation and prospers.&nbsp; How, then,
are you to checkmate him?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; A wise man never
attempts what cannot be accomplished.&nbsp; I work on the assumption
that my Butler is, like Brutus, an honourable man, treating him with
consideration, and fostering his self-respect, even at the cost, perhaps,
of a little hypocrisy.&nbsp; It is a gracious form of hypocrisy, and
one that often justifies itself in the end, for the man tends to become
what you assume that he is.&nbsp; For myself, I confess that I yield
to the butler&rsquo;s claim to go to market, albeit I am assured that
he derives unjust advantages therefrom, more easily than I reconcile
myself to that other privilege of standing, with arms folded, behind
me while I breakfast, or tiffin, or dine.&nbsp; I can endure the suspicion
that he is growing rich while I am growing poor, but that argus supervision
over my necessary food is like a canker, and his indefatigable attentiveness
would ruin the healthiest appetite.&nbsp; After removing the cover from
the &ldquo;beefysteak&rdquo; and raising one end of the dish that I
may get at the gravy more easily, he offers me potatoes, and I try to
overcome an instinctive repugnance to the large and mealy tuber under
which he has adjusted the spoon in order to lighten my labour.&nbsp;
After the potatoes there are vegetables.&nbsp; Then he moves the salt
a little nearer me and I help myself.&nbsp; Next he presses the cruet-stand
on my attention, putting the spoon into the mustard pot and taking the
stopper out of the sauce bottle.&nbsp; I submit in the hope that I may
now be allowed to begin; but he has salad or tomatoes or something else
requiring attention.&nbsp; I submit once more and then assume my knife
and fork.&nbsp; He watches his opportunity and insinuates a pickle bottle,
holding the fork in his right hand.&nbsp; I feel that it is time to
make a stand, so I give him one unspeakable look and proceed with my
meal, whereupon he retreats and I breathe a little more freely.&nbsp;
But no; he is at my left hand again with bread.&nbsp; To do him justice,
he is quite willing to save me annoyance by impaling a slice on the
knife and transferring it to my plate, but I prefer to help myself,
which encourages him to return to the charge with butter and then jam.&nbsp;
This looks like the end, but his resources are infinite.&nbsp; His eye
falls on the sugar basin standing beside my teacup, and he immediately
takes it up and, coming round to my left side, holds it to my nose.&nbsp;
All this time sit I, like Tantalus, with the savoriest of Domingo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;beefysteaks&rdquo; before me and am not allowed to taste it.&nbsp;
But I know that in every operation he is animated by an exalted sense
of blended duty and prerogative, and if I could really open his mind
to the thought that the least of his attentions was dispensable, his
whole nature would be demoralized at once; so I endure and grow lean.&nbsp;
Another thing which works towards the same result is a practice that
he has of studying my tastes, and when he thinks he has detected a preference
for a particular dish, plying me with that until the very sight of it
becomes nauseous.&nbsp; At one time he fed me with &ldquo;broon custard&rdquo;
pudding for about six months, until in desperation I interdicted that
preparation for evermore, and he fell back upon &ldquo;lemol custard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus my luxuries are cut off one after another and there is little left
that I can eat.</p>
<p>Our grandfathers used to have Parsee butlers in tall hats to wait
upon them, but that race is now extinct.&nbsp; The Butler on this side
of India is now a Goanese, or a Soortee, or, more rarely, a Mussulman.&nbsp;
Each of these has, doubtless, his own characteristics; but have you
ever stepped back a few paces and contemplated, not your own or anyone
else&rsquo;s individual servant, but the entire phenomenon of an Indian
Butler?&nbsp; Here is a man whose food by nature is curry and rice,
before a hillock of which he sits cross-legged, and putting his five
fingers into it, makes a large bolus, which he pushes into his mouth.&nbsp;
He repeats this till all is gone, and then he sleeps like a boa-constrictor
until he recovers his activity; or else he feeds on great flat cakes
of wheat flour, off which he rends jagged-pieces and lubricates them
with some spicy and unctuous gravy.&nbsp; All our ways of life, our
meats and drinks, and all our notions of propriety and fitness in connection
with the complicated business of appeasing our hunger as becomes our
station, all these are a foreign land to him: yet he has made himself
altogether at home in them.&nbsp; He has a sound practical knowledge
of all our viands, their substance, and the mode of their preparation,
their qualities, relationships and harmonies, and the exact place they
hold in our great cenatorial system.&nbsp; He knows all liquors also
by name, with their places and times of appearing.&nbsp; And he is as
great in action as in knowledge.&nbsp; When he takes the command of
a <i>burra khana</i> he is a Wellington.&nbsp; He plans with foresight,
and executes with fortitude and self-reliance.&nbsp; See him marshal
his own troops and his auxiliary butlers while he carves and dispenses
the joint!&nbsp; Then he puts himself at their head and invades the
dining-room.&nbsp; He meets with reverses;&mdash;the claret-jug collides
with a dish in full sail and sheds its contents on his white coat; the
punkah rope catches his turban and tosses it into a lady&rsquo;s lap,
exposing his curiously shaven head to the public merriment; but, though
disconcerted, he is not defeated.&nbsp; He never forgets his position
or loses sight of his dignity.&nbsp; His mistress discusses him with
such wit as may be at her command, and he understands but smiles not.&nbsp;
When the action is over he retires from the field, divests himself of
his robes of office and sits down, as he was bred to do, before that
hillock of curry and rice.</p>
<p>Even good Homer nods, and I confess I am still haunted by the memory
of a day when my Chief was my guest, and the butler served up red herrings
neatly done up in&mdash;<i>The Times of India!</i></p>

<h2>DOMINGO, THE COOK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I do not remember who was the author of the observation that a great
nation in a state of decay betakes itself to the fine arts.&nbsp; Perhaps
no one has made the observation yet.&nbsp; It is certainly among the
records of my brain, but I may possibly have put it there myself.&nbsp;
If so, I make it now, for the possibilities of originality are getting
scarce and will soon disappear from the face of the earth as completely
as the mastodon.&nbsp; The present application of the saying is to the
people of Goa, who, while they carry through the world patronymics which
breathe of conquest and discovery, devote their energies rather to the
violin and the art of cookery.&nbsp; The caviller may object to the
application of the words &ldquo;fine art&rdquo; to culinary operations,
but the objection rests on superficial thought.&nbsp; A deeper view
will show that art is in the artist, not in his subject or his materials.&nbsp;
Perusal of the Codes of the Financial Department showed me many years
ago that the retrenchment of my pay and allowances could be elevated
to a fine art by devotion of spirit, combined with a fine sense of law.&nbsp;
And to Domingo the preparation of dinner is indeed a fine art.&nbsp;
Trammel his genius, confine him within the limits of what is commonly
called a &ldquo;plain dinner,&rdquo; and he cannot cook.&nbsp; He stews
his meat before putting it into a pie, he thickens his custard with
flour instead of eggs, he roasts a leg of mutton by boiling it first
and doing &ldquo;littlee brown&rdquo; afterwards; in short, what does
he not do?&nbsp; It is true of all his race.&nbsp; How loathsome were
Pedro&rsquo;s mutton chops, and Camilo could not boil potatoes decently
for a dinner of less than four courses.&nbsp; But let him loose on a
<i>burra khana</i>, give him <i>carte blanche</i> as to sauces and essences
and spicery, and all his latent faculties and concealed accomplishments
unfold themselves like a lotus flower in the morning.&nbsp; No one could
have suspected that the shame-faced little man harboured such resources.&nbsp;
If he has not always the subtlest perception of the harmonics of flavours,
what a mastery he shows of strong effects and striking contrasts, what
fecundity of invention, what a play of fancy in decoration, what manual
dexterity, what rapidity and certainty in all his operations!&nbsp;
And the marvel increases when we consider the simplicity of his implements
and materials.&nbsp; His studio is fitted with half a dozen small fireplaces,
and furnished with an assortment of copper pots, a chopper, two tin
spoons&mdash;but he can do without these,&mdash;a ladle made of half
a cocoanut shell at the end of a stick, and a slab of stone with a stone
roller on it; also a rickety table; a very gloomy and ominous looking
table, whose undulating surface is chopped and hacked and scarred, begrimed,
besmeared, smoked, oiled, stained with juices of many substances.&nbsp;
On this table he minces meat, chops onions, rolls pastry and sleeps;
a very useful table.&nbsp; In the midst of these he hustles about, putting
his face at intervals into one of his fires and blowing through a short
bamboo tube, which is his bellows, such a potent blast that for a moment
his whole head is enveloped in a cloud of ashes and cinders, which also
descend copiously on the half-made tart and the <i>souffl&eacute;</i>
and the custard.&nbsp; Then he takes up an egg, gives it three smart
raps with the nail of his forefinger, and in half a second the yoke
is in one vessel and the white in another.&nbsp; The fingers of his
left hand are his strainer.&nbsp; Every second or third egg he tosses
aside, having detected, as it passed through the said strainer that
age had rendered it unsuitable for his purposes; sometimes he does not
detect this.&nbsp; From eggs he proceeds to onions, then he is taking
the stones out of raisins, or shelling peas.&nbsp; There is a standard
English cookery book which commences most of its instructions with the
formula, &ldquo;wash your hands carefully, using a nail brush.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Domingo does not observe this ceremony, but he often wipes his fingers
upon his pantaloons.&nbsp; It occurs to me, however, that I do not wisely
pursue this theme; for the mysteries of Domingo&rsquo;s craft are no
fit subject for the gratification of an irreverent curiosity.&nbsp;
Those words of the poet,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where ignorance is bliss,<br />&rsquo;Tis folly to be wise,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>have no truer application.&nbsp; You will reap the bliss when you
sit down to the savoury result.</p>
<p>Though Domingo is naturally shy, and does not make a display of his
attainments, he is a man of education, and is quite prepared, if you
wish it, to write out his menu.&nbsp; Here is a sample</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Soup</i>.<br />Salary Soup.</p>
<p><i>Fis</i>.<br />Heel fish fry.</p>
<p><i>Madish</i>.<br />Russel Pups.&nbsp; Wormsil mole.</p>
<p><i>Joint</i>.<br />Roast Bastard.</p>
<p><i>Toast</i>.<br />Anchovy Poshteg.</p>
<p><i>Puddin</i>.<br />Billimunj.&nbsp; Ispunj roli.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I must take this opportunity to record a true story of a menu, though
it does not properly pertain to Domingo, but an ingenious Ramaswamy,
of Madras.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s master liked everything very proper,
and insisted on a written <i>menu</i> at every meal.&nbsp; One morning
Ramaswamy was much embarrassed, for the principal dish at breakfast
was to be devilled turkey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Devil very bad word,&rdquo;
he said to himself; &ldquo;how can write?&rdquo;&nbsp; At last he solved
the difficulty, and the dish appeared as &ldquo;D---d turkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our surprise at Domingo&rsquo;s attainments is no doubt due very
much to the humble attire in which we are accustomed to see him, his
working dress being a <i>quondam</i> white cotton jacket and a pair
of blue checked pantaloons of a strong material made in jails, or two
pairs, the sound parts of one being arranged to underlie the holes in
the other.&nbsp; When once we have seen the gentleman dressed for church
on a festival day, with the beaver which has descended to him from his
illustrious grandfather&rsquo;s benevolent master respectfully held
in his hand, and his well brushed hair shining with a bountiful allowance
of cocoanut ointment, surprise ceases.&nbsp; He is indeed a much respected
member of society, and enjoys the esteem of his club, where he sometimes
takes chambers when out of employment.&nbsp; By his fellow servants,
too, he is recognised as a professional man, and called The Maistrie,
but, like ourselves, he is an exile, and, like some of us, he is separated
from his wife and children, so his thoughts run much upon furlough and
ultimate retirement, and he adopts a humble style of life with the object
of saving money.&nbsp; In this object he succeeds most remarkably.&nbsp;
Little as we know of the home life of our Hindoo servants, we know almost
less about that of Domingo, for he rarely has his family with him.&nbsp;
Is he a fond husband and an indulgent father?&nbsp; I fancy he is when
his better nature is uppermost, but I am bound to confess that the cardinal
vice of his character is cruelty, not the passive cruelty of the pure
Asiatic, but that ferocious cruelty which generally marks an infusion
of European blood.&nbsp; The infusion in him has filtered through so
many generations that it must be very weak indeed, but it shows itself.&nbsp;
When I see an emaciated crow with the point of its beak chopped off,
so that it cannot pick up its food, or another with a tin pot fastened
with wire to its bleeding nose, I know whose handiwork is there.&nbsp;
Domingo suffers grievously from the depredations of crows, and when
his chance comes he enjoys a savage retribution.&nbsp; Some allowance
must be made for the hardening influence of his profession; familiarity
with murder makes him callous.&nbsp; When he executes a <i>moorgee</i>
he does it in the way of sport, and sits, like an ancient Roman, <i>verso
pollice</i>, enjoying the spectacle of its dying struggles.</p>
<p>According to his lights Domingo is a religious man; that is to say,
he wears a necklace of red beads, eats fish on Fridays, observes festivals
and holidays, and gives pretty liberally to the church under pressure.&nbsp;
So he maintains a placid condition of conscience while his monthly remittance
to Goa exceeds the amount of his salary.&nbsp; He rises early on Sunday
morning to go to confession, and I would give something to have the
place, just one day, of the good father to whom he unbosoms himself.&nbsp;
But perhaps I am wrong.&nbsp; I daresay he believes he has nothing to
confess.</p>
<p>One story more to teach us to judge charitably of Domingo.&nbsp;
A lady was inveighing to a friend against the whole race of Indian cooks
as dirty, disorderly, and dishonest.&nbsp; She had managed to secure
the services of a Chinese cook, and was much pleased with the contrast.&nbsp;
Her friend did not altogether agree with her, and was sceptical about
the immaculate Chinaman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put it to the test,&rdquo; said
the lady; &ldquo;just let us pay a visit to your kitchen, and then come
and see mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went together.&nbsp; What need to
describe the <i>Bobberjee-Khana</i>?&nbsp; They glanced round, and hurried
out, for it was too horrible to be endured long.&nbsp; When they went
to the Chinaman&rsquo;s kitchen, the contrast was indeed striking.&nbsp;
The pots and pans shone like silver; the table was positively sweet;
everything was in its proper place, and Chang himself, sitting on his
box, was washing his feet in the soup tureen!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE MUSSAUL, OR MAN OF LAMPS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The <i>Mussaul&rsquo;s</i> name is Mukkun, which means butter, and
of this commodity I believe he absorbs as much as he can honestly or
dishonestly come by.&nbsp; How else does the surface of him acquire
that glossy, oleaginous appearance, as if he would take fire easily
and burn well?&nbsp; I wish we could do without him!&nbsp; The centre
of his influence, a small room in the suburbs of the dining-room, which
he calls the <i>dispence</i>, or <i>dispence-khana</i>, is a place of
unwholesome sights and noisome odours, which it is good not to visit
unless as Hercules visited the stables of Augeas.&nbsp; The instruments
of his profession are there, a large <i>handie</i> full of very greasy
water, with bits of lemon peel and fragments of broken victuals swimming
in it, and a short, stout stick, with a little bunch of foul rag tied
to one end of it.&nbsp; Here the <i>Mussaul</i> sits on the ice <i>numda</i>
while we have our meals, and as each plate returns from the table, he
takes charge of it, and transfers to his mouth whatever he finds on
it, for he is of the <i>omnivora</i>, like the crow.&nbsp; Then he seizes
his weapon of offence, and, dipping the rag end into the <i>handie</i>,
gives the plate a masterly wipe, and lays it on the table upside down,
or dries it with a damask table napkin.&nbsp; The butler encourages
him for some reason to use up the table napkins in this way.&nbsp; I
suppose it is because he does not like to waste the <i>dhobie</i> on
anything before it is properly soiled.&nbsp; When the <i>Mussaul</i>
has disposed of the breakfast things in this summary way, he betakes
himself to the great work of the day, the polishing of the knives.&nbsp;
He first plunges the ivory handles into boiling water, and leaves them
to steep for a time, then he seats himself on the ice again, and, arranging
a plank of wood in a sloping position, holds it fast with his toes,
rubs it well with a piece of bath brick, and commences to polish with
all the energy which he has saved by the neglect of other duties.&nbsp;
Hour after hour the squeaky, squeaky, squeaky sound of that board plays
upon your nerves, not the nerves of the ear, but the nerves of the mind,
for there is more in it than the ear can convey.&nbsp; Every sight and
every sound in this world comes to us inextricably woven into the warp
which the mind supplies, and, as you listen to that baleful sound, you
seem to feel with your finger points the back of each good, new knife
getting sharper and sharper, and to watch its progress as it wears away
at the point of greatest pressure, until the end of the blade is connected
with the rest by a narrow neck, which eventually breaks, and the point
falls off, leaving the knife in that condition so familiar to us all,
when the blade, about three inches long, ends in a jagged, square point,
the handle having, meanwhile, acquired a rich orange hue.&nbsp; Oh,
those knives! those knives!</p>
<p>Etymologically Mukkun is a man of lamps, and, when he has brushed
your boots and stowed them away under your bed, putting the left boot
on the right side and <i>vice versa</i>, in order that the toes may
point outwards, as he considers they should, then he addresses himself
to this part of his duty.&nbsp; Old Bombayites can remember the days
of cocoanut, when he had to begin his operations during the cold season
by putting a row of bottles out in the sun to melt the frozen oil; but
kerosine has changed all that, and he has nothing to do but to trim
the wick into that fork-tailed pattern in which he delights, and which
secures the minimum of light with the maximum destruction of chimneys,
to smear the outside of each lamp with his greasy fingers, to conjure
away a gallon or so of oil, and to meet remonstrance with a child-like
query, &ldquo;Do I drink kerosene oil?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he unbends,
and gives himself up to a gentle form of recreation in which he finds
much enjoyment.&nbsp; This is to perch on a low wall or big stone at
the garden gate, and watch the carriages and horses as they pass by.&nbsp;
Other <i>Mussauls</i>, <i>ghorawallas</i>, and passing ice coolies stop
and perch beside him, and sometimes an <i>ayah</i> or two, with a perambulator
and its weary little occupant, grace the gathering.&nbsp; I suppose
the topics of the day are discussed, the chances of a Russian invasion,
the dearness of rice, and the events which led to the dismissal of Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s old <i>Mussaul</i> Canjee.&nbsp; Then the time for the
lighting of lamps arrives, and Mukkun returns to his duties.</p>
<p>You might not perhaps suspect it, but Mukkun is a prey to vanity.&nbsp;
The pure oily transparency of his Italian complexion commands his admiration,
and he thinks much of those glossy love-locks which emerge from his
turban and curl in front of his ears.&nbsp; Several times a day he goes
into his room to contemplate himself in a small hand mirror, and to
wind up the love-locks on his finger.&nbsp; Poor Mukkun has, indeed,
a very human side, and the phenomenon which we recognise as our <i>Mussaul</i>
is not the whole of him.&nbsp; By birth he is an agriculturist, and
there is in the environs of Surat a little plot of land and a small
dilapidated hut in one corner of it, overgrown with monstrous gourds,
which he thinks of as home, sweet home.&nbsp; There are his young barbarians
all at play, but he, their sire, is forced to seek service abroad because,
as he practically expresses it, the produce of his small field is not
sufficient to fill so many bellies.&nbsp; But, wherever he wanders,
his heart&mdash;for he has a heart&mdash;flutters about that rickety
hut, and as he sits polishing your boots of a morning, you may hear
him pensively humming to himself:&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Beatus ille qui, procul negotiis,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ut prisca
gens mortalium,<br />Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solutus
omni f&oelig;nore.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He puts a peculiar pathos into the last line, for he is grievously
haunted by an apparition in the form of an old man with a small red
turban, gold earrings, and grey beard parted in the middle, who flourishes
a paper in his face and talks of the debtors&rsquo; gaol; and hints
that he will have the little house and field near Surat.&nbsp; Mukkun
first fell into the net of this spider many years ago, when he wanted
a few hundred rupees to enable him to celebrate the marriage of his
little child.&nbsp; He signed a bond for twice the amount he received
then, and it continues to increase from year to year, though he has
paid the principal twice over in interest; at least he thinks he has,
but he is not a good accountant.&nbsp; Every now and then he is required
to sign some fresh document, of the contents of which he knows nothing,
but the effect of which is always the same&mdash;<i>viz</i>., to heap
up his liabilities and rivet his fetters more firmly, and punctually
on pay day every month, the grim old man waylays him and compels him
to disgorge his wages, allowing him so much grain and spices as will
keep him in condition till next pay day.&nbsp; In a word, Mukkun is
a slave.&nbsp; Yet he does not jump into the garden well, nor his quietus
make with a bare bodkin.&nbsp; No, he plods through life, eats his rice
and curry with gusto, smokes his cigarette with satisfaction, oils his
lovelocks, borrows money from the cook to buy a set of silver buttons
for his waistcoat, and when he tires of them, pawns them to pay for
a velvet cap on which he has set his heart.&nbsp; In short, he behaves
<i>&agrave; la Mukkun</i>, and no insight is to be had by examining
his case through English spectacles; but it is our strange infirmity,
being the most singular people on earth, to regard ourselves as typical
of the human race, and <i>ergo</i> to conclude that what is good for
us cannot be otherwise than good for all the world.&nbsp; Hence many
of our anti-tyranny agitations and philanthropies, not always beneficial
to the subjects of them, and also many of our misplaced sympathies.&nbsp;
We see a spider eating a fly, and long to crush the spider, while we
shed a tear for the fly.&nbsp; But the spider is much the higher animal
of the two.&nbsp; It labours long hours laying out a net, and then waits
all day for the fruit of its toil.&nbsp; Insects are caught and escape
again, the net gets broken, and when, after many disappointments, the
spider secures a fat fly, what advantage does it derive?&nbsp; A meal;
just what the fly got by sitting in a pit of manure and sipping till
it could sip no more.&nbsp; Doom that fly to the life which the spider
leads, and it would drown itself in your milk jug on the spot, unable
to bear up under such a weight of care and toil.&nbsp; In this parable
the fly is Mukkun and the spider is Shylock, and my sympathies are not
wholly given to the former.&nbsp; I quite admit that Shylock worries
him cruelly, and if he had not given hostages to fortune, he would abscond
with a light heart to some distant station where he might forget his
old debts and contract new ones.&nbsp; But this is not the alternative
before him.&nbsp; The alternative is to take care of his money, not
to buy things which he cannot afford, to do without the silver buttons,
and postpone the velvet cap, all which would put a strain on his mental
and moral constitution, under which he would wear out in a week.&nbsp;
He must find some other <i>modus vivendi</i> than that.&nbsp; If he
had lived in the world&rsquo;s infancy, he would have sold himself and
his family to someone who would have fed him and clothed him, and relieved
him of the cares of life.&nbsp; But Britons never, never, never shall
be slaves, and under our rule Mukkun is forced to share that disability;
so he attains his end in an indirect way, and lives thereafter in such
happiness as nature has given him capacity to enjoy.&nbsp; Shylock will
neither put him into gaol nor seize his field.&nbsp; We do not send
our milch cow to the butcher.&nbsp; Shylock owns a hundred such as he,
and much trouble they give him.</p>
<p>Mukkun lives in dread of the devil.&nbsp; Nothing will induce him
to pass at night by places where the foul fiend is known to walk, nor
will he sleep alone without a light.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE HAMAL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The <i>Hamal</i> is a creature which gets up very early in the morning,
before anyone is out of bed, and opens the doors and windows with as
much noise as may be.&nbsp; He leaves the hooks unfastened, that a <i>feu-de-joie</i>
may celebrate the advent of the first gust of wind.&nbsp; He drops the
lower bolts of the doors, so that they may rake up the matting every
time they are opened.&nbsp; Then he proceeds to dust the furniture with
the duster which hangs over his shoulder.&nbsp; He does this because
it is his duty, and with no view to any practical result; consequently
it never occurs to him to look at what he is doing, and you will afterwards
find curiously shaped patches of dust which have escaped the sweep of
his &ldquo;towal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He next turns his attention to the books
in the bookcase, and we are all familiar with his ravages there.&nbsp;
He is usually content to bang them well with his duster, but I refer
to high days, when he takes each book out and caresses it on both sides,
replacing it upside down, and putting the different volumes of each
work on different shelves.&nbsp; All this he does, not of malice, but
simply because &rsquo;tis his nature to.&nbsp; He does not disturb the
cobwebs on the corners of the bookcase, because you never told him to
do so.&nbsp; As he moves grunting about the room, the duster falls from
his shoulder, and he picks it up with his toes to avoid the fatigue
of stooping.&nbsp; When all the dusting is done, and the table-covers
and ornaments are replaced, then he proceeds to shake the carpets and
sweep the floor, for it is one of his ways, when left to himself, to
dust first and sweep after.&nbsp; Finally he disposes of the rubbish
which his broom has collected, by stowing it away under a cupboard,
or pushing it out over the doorstep among the ferns and calladiums.</p>
<p>Such is the Hamal in his youth, and as he grows older he gets more
so.&nbsp; About middle life he sets hard, like plaster of Paris, his
senses get obfuscated, and a shell appears to form on the outside of
his intellect, so that access to his understanding becomes very difficult.&nbsp;
Sometimes his temper also grows crabbed, and <i>noli me tangere</i>
writes itself distinctly across the mark of his god on his old brow.&nbsp;
A <i>Hamal</i> in this phase is the most impracticable animal in this
universe.&nbsp; When found fault with, he never answers back, but he
enters on a vigorous conversation with himself, which is like a tune
on a musical box, for it must be allowed to go until it runs itself
out; nothing short of smashing the instrument will stop it.&nbsp; How
well I remember one veteran of this type, from whose colloquies with
his own soul I gathered that he had been fifty-six years in gentlemen&rsquo;s
service, and never served any but gentlemen until he came to me.&nbsp;
He computed his age, I think, at seventy-two, and asked leave to attend
the funeral of his grandfather.&nbsp; Sometimes, happily, the <i>Hamal&rsquo;s</i>
senility takes the direction of benevolence.&nbsp; Who does not know
the benign, stupid old man, with his snowy whiskers and kindly smile,
which seems to grow kindlier with every tooth he loses!</p>
<p>It is a practical question whether you should endure the <i>Hamal</i>,
or address yourself to the task of his reformation, and I am content
to make myself singular by advocating the latter for two reasons; firstly,
because he cannot be endured; secondly, because I cherish a fantastic
faith in his reformability,&mdash;at least if you take him in his youth,
before he has set.&nbsp; I believe we fail to cure him either because
we do not try, or because we dismiss him before we succeed.&nbsp; Another
great impediment to success in this enterprise is the foolish habit
of getting wrathful.&nbsp; An untimely explosion of wrath will generally
blow a sensitive Hamal&rsquo;s wits quite out of his own reach, and
of course, out of yours; or, if he is of the stolid sort, he will set
it down as a phenomenon incidental to <i>sahebs</i>, but without any
bearing on the matter in hand, and he will go on as before.&nbsp; Besides,
a state of indignation is very detrimental to your own command of the
language, and if you could in cold blood take your &ldquo;Forbes&rdquo;
and study some of the sentences which you fulminated in your ebullitions
of anger, you would cease to wonder that the subject of them was such
an idiot.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Hum roz roz hookum day,<br />Tum roz roz hookum nay,<br />Ooswasty
lukree&mdash;(whack, whack)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>went home, I have no doubt, but it is the gift of few to be at once
so luminous and so forcible.&nbsp; Try handling your <i>Hamal</i> in
another way.&nbsp; Call him mildly&mdash;a mild tone thaws his understanding&mdash;and
say to him, &ldquo;Look here, my son.&nbsp; Do you see this gold writing
on the backs of these books?&nbsp; For what purpose is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He will reply, &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then you can proceed,
&ldquo;That writing is the mark by which you may know the head of any
book.&nbsp; Now consider, should a book stand on its head?&rdquo;&nbsp;
If he replies, &ldquo;How should a book stand on its head?&rdquo; then
you are getting access to his intelligence, and may lead him on gradually
to the conclusion that, whenever he puts a book into the shelves, he
should make it stand so that the writing on the back of it may be uppermost.&nbsp;
I tell you he will beam with intelligence, and rise earlier next morning
to put his new learning into practice.&nbsp; After a few days he will
forget and relapse into his old ways, but you must have patience.</p>
<p>After all, I think we could put up with the <i>Hamal</i> if only
he would not try to think.&nbsp; This is his crowning vice.&nbsp; In
vain I try to impress upon him that I engaged him to obey orders, and
would rather do the thinking myself.&nbsp; Every now and then, at some
particular phase of the moon, he sets his intellect in operations and
the consequences are, as the Brahmin boy described the result of his
examination, &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was our <i>Hamal&rsquo;s</i>
duty to fill the filter, and at a time when the water was very bad,
orders were given that it should be boiled before being filtered.&nbsp;
One day, my wife saw the <i>Hamal</i> in the act of filling the filter,
and it occurred to her to warn him to let the water cool first, lest
he might crack the filter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
thought of that.&nbsp; After boiling the water, I cool it down by mixing
an equal quantity of cold water with it, and then I put it into the
filter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Bombay, since hard times set in, the offices of <i>Hamal</i> and
<i>mussaul</i> have got a little mixed, and a man will show you characters
testifying that he has served in both capacities.&nbsp; Such a man is,
properly speaking, simply a <i>mussaul</i> who has tried to do the <i>Hamal&rsquo;s</i>
work.&nbsp; The cleaner of furniture and the lighter of lamps and washer
of plates and dishes cannot change places or be combined.&nbsp; I have
read that the making of one English pin employs nine men, but it is
a vain boast.&nbsp; The rudiments of division of labour are not understood
in Europe.&nbsp; In this country every trade is a breed.&nbsp; Rama
is by birth a cleaner of furniture.&nbsp; This kind of employment came
into the country with our rule, so that the domestic <i>Hamal</i>, who
is an offshoot of the <i>palkee hamal</i>, or &ldquo;bearer,&rdquo;
has not had time to become what fanciers would call a permanent strain,
and you will find that you can convert Rama into a <i>chupprasse</i>,
a <i>malee</i>, or even a <i>ghorawalla</i>, but into a <i>mussaul</i>
never.&nbsp; He is a <i>shoodra</i>, sprung from the feet of Brahma,
and the Brahman, who sprung from the head of the same figure, despises
him, but not with that depth of contempt with which he himself despises
the <i>mussaul</i>, who is an outcast, and sprang from nowhere in particular.&nbsp;
He cannot conceive that thirty generations of washing could purify the
descendants of Mukkun so that he might touch them and not be unclean.&nbsp;
You, his master, rank theoretically with Mukkun, and he will neither
touch your meats nor the plate off which you have eaten them.&nbsp;
He will keep your house clean, and even perform some personal services,
for he has a liberal mind, and is there not also a <i>toolsee</i> plant
in a pot on a kind of earthen altar in front of his hut, before which
he performs purificatory ceremonies every morning?&nbsp; And does he
not bathe after leaving your presence before he eats?&nbsp; If you pass
by the clean place where he is about to cook his food in the morning,
you will see a large pot of water on the fire.&nbsp; When this gets
warm&mdash;for Rama is not a Spartan&mdash;he will stand on a smooth
stone, as sparingly clad as it is possible to be, and pour the water
on his head, polishing himself vigorously as it runs down his limbs;
then, after dressing his long hair and tying it in a knot on the top
of his head, he will sit down to eat, in a place by himself, with the
feeling that he has warded off defilement from that which goeth in at
his mouth.&nbsp; That which goeth out of his mouth gives him no concern.</p>

<h2>THE BODY-GUARDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Our <i>Chupprassees</i> are the outward expression of our authority,
and the metre-gauge of our importance.&nbsp; By them the untutored mind
of the poor Indian is enabled to estimate the amount of reverence due
to each of us.&nbsp; This is the first purpose for which we are provided
with Chupprassees.&nbsp; The second is that they may deliver our commands,
post our letters, and escort the coming generation of Government servants
in their little perambulators.&nbsp; As the number required for the
first purpose usually far exceeds the number required for the second,
there is danger of Satan finding mischief for their idle hands to do,
and it becomes our duty to ward off this danger by occupying their hands
with something which is not mischief.&nbsp; This we do faithfully, and
the <i>Chupprassee</i> always reminds me of those tools we see advertised,
which combine hammer, pincers, turnscrew, chisel, foot-rule, hatchet,
file, toothpick, and life preserver.&nbsp; Mrs. Smart bewailed the bygone
day when every servant in her house was a Government <i>Chupprassee</i>
except the <i>khansamah</i> and a Portuguese <i>ayah</i>.&nbsp; I did
not live in that day, but in my own I have seen the <i>Chupprassee</i>
discharge many functions.&nbsp; He is an expert <i>shikaree</i>, sometimes
a good tailor or barber, not a bad cook at a pinch, a handy table boy,
and, above all an unequalled child&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; There can
be little doubt, it the truth were told, that Little Henry&rsquo;s bearer
was a <i>Chupprassee</i>.&nbsp; He also milks the cow, waters the garden,
catches butterflies, skins birds, blows eggs, and runs after tennis
balls.&nbsp; If you ask himself what his duties are, he will reply promptly
that it is his duty to wear the sircar&rsquo;s belt and to &ldquo;be
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the camel is not more wonderfully fitted for
the desert than is Luxumon for the discharge of these solemn responsibilities.&nbsp;
He is like a carriage clock, able to sleep in any conceivable position;
and such is his mental constitution that, when not sleeping, he is able
to &ldquo;be present&rdquo; hour after hour without feeling any desire
for change of occupation.&nbsp; <i>Ennui</i> never troubles him, time
never hangs heavy on his hands; he sits as patiently as a cow and chews
the cud of <i>pan suparee</i>, and he bespatters the walls with a sanguinary
pigment produced by the mastication of the same.&nbsp; He needs no food,
but he goes out to drink water thirty-five times a day, and, when he
returns refreshed, a certain acrid odour penetrates every crevice of
the house, almost dislodging the rats and exterminating the lesser vermin.&nbsp;
To liken it to the smell of tobacco would give civilized mankind a claim
against me for defamation of character.</p>
<p>I will sketch my ideal of a model <i>Chupprassee</i>.&nbsp; He is
a follower of the Prophet, for your Gentoo has too many superstitions
and scruples to be generally useful.&nbsp; He parts his short black
beard in the middle and brushes it up his cheek on either side, the
ends of his moustache are trimly curled, he wears his turban a little
on one side, carries himself like a soldier, and is always scrupulously
clean.&nbsp; He comes into your presence with a salutation which expresses
his own dignity, while it respects yours.&nbsp; He wishes to know whether
the protector of the poor has any commands for his slave.&nbsp; When
you intimate your wishes he responds with a formula which is the same
for all occasions&mdash;&ldquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s commands shall
be executed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they are executed.&nbsp; If he knows of
difficulties or impossibilities, he keeps them to himself.&nbsp; Alas!
this is an ideal, how antipodal sometimes to the real!&nbsp; I am thinking
of the gigantic Sheikh Mahomed, with his terrible beard and womanly
voice, who would convey my commands to a menial of lower degree and
return in five minutes to detail the objections which that person had
raised.&nbsp; Another type of Mahomedan <i>Chupprassee</i>, whom we
see is to abhor, expresses his opinion of himself by letting half a
yard of rag hang down from his turban behind.&nbsp; He calls himself
a <i>Syed</i> and, perhaps, on account of the sanctity implied in this,
forbears to wash himself or his clothes.&nbsp; This man is clever, officious,
familiar, servile, and very fond of the position of umbrella-bearer
in ordinary to your person: therefore, transfer him to the personal
staff of some native dignitary, where he will be appreciated.&nbsp;
If my model does not suit you, there are many types to choose from.&nbsp;
We have the lofty and sonorous <i>Purdaisee</i>, the <i>Rajpoot</i>,
son of kings, the <i>Bhundaree</i>, or hereditary climber of palm trees,
the Israelite, the low caste, useful, intelligent <i>Mahar</i>, and
many more.&nbsp; Even the Brahmin in this iron age becomes a <i>Chupprassee</i>.&nbsp;
But three-fourths of all our belted satellites come from one little
district south of Bombay, known to our fathers as Rutnagherry, re-christened
Ratnagiri by the Hon. W. W. Hunter, C.I.E., A.B.C., D.E.F., etc.&nbsp;
Every country has its own special products; the Malabar Coast sends
us cocoanuts and pepper; artichokes come from Jerusalem; ducks, lace,
cooks, and fiddlers from Goa.&nbsp; So Rutnagherry produces pineapples
and Mahrattas, and the Mahrattas do not eat the pineapples.&nbsp; Till
quite recently they employed themselves exterminating each other, burning
each other&rsquo;s villages and crops, and inventing new ways of torturing
old men to make them confess where their money was buried.&nbsp; We
have stopped these practices without stopping the religious arrangements
for keeping up the supply of the race; so the Mahratta marries, as in
duty bound, and multiplies, and then casts about for some way of maintaining
his growing family; and our <i>Chupprassee</i> system, looked at politically,
is a grand escape pipe.&nbsp; Pandurang Huree gives the Mahrattas the
palm, as liars, over all the other races of India.&nbsp; He may be right,
but where excellence is so universal, comparison becomes doubly odious.&nbsp;
Some Mahrattas put <i>rao</i> after their names and treat themselves
with much respect, especially if they can grow a little island of whisker
on each cheek and run the moustache into it.&nbsp; These men differ
from common Mahrattas in the same way as Mr. Wilberforce Jones, or Mr.
Palmerston Smith, differs from the ordinary run of Joneses and Smiths.</p>
<p>How uniformly does ambition rule us all!&nbsp; The young <i>rao</i>,
fired by the hope of wearing a belt, makes a bold resolve to leave his
father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers, their wives
and children, his uncles, aunts, and cousins, and the little hut in
which they have all lived so happily since he was a little, naked, crawling
thing, dressed in a silver rupee.&nbsp; He looks for the last time on
the buffalo and the lame pariah dog, ties up his cooking pots and a
change of raiment in a red handkerchief, and starts on foot, amid the
howling of females, for the great town, a hundred miles away, where
the brother-in-law of his cousin&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s uncle is on the
personal staff of the Collector.&nbsp; He fears that the water of the
place may not suit his constitution, but he risks that and other unknown
perils.&nbsp; Arriving at his destination, he works his interest by
quartering himself on his influential connection, who, finding that
an extra seer of rice has to be boiled for every meal, leaves no stone
unturned to find employment for him.&nbsp; First a written petition
is drawn up by the local petition writer, in the following terms &ldquo;Most
Honoured and Respected Sir,&mdash;Although I am conscious that my present
step will apparently be deemed an unjustifiable and unpardonable one,
tantamounting to a preposterous hardihood in presuming to trespass (amidst
your multifarious vocations) on your valuable time, yet placing implicit
reliance on your noble nature and magnanimity of heart, I venture to
do so, and ardently trust you will pardon me.&nbsp; Learning that a
vacancy of a sepoy has occurred under your kind auspices, I beg most
respectfully to tender my services for the same, and crave your permission
to invite your benign attention to the episodes of my chequered life,
though of a doleful and sombre nature, and <i>concatenation</i> of melancholy
events that have made their visitations.&nbsp; My eldest brother died
one year since, leaving an heritage of a relict and two female issues
to bemoan and lament his premature and irreparable loss.&nbsp; And two
months since my revered parent paid debt of nature, at 2 p.m. on 15th
February, A.D. 18--, thus leaving the entire burden of 13 (thirteen)
souls on my individual shoulders, which, in my present and forlorn circumferences,
I am unable to cope with.&nbsp; I, therefore, throw myself on your benevolent
clemency and humane consideration, and implore you to confer the vacancy
in question which will enable me to meet the daily unavoidable returning
requisites of domestic life in all their varied ramifications, and relieve
a famishing family from the jaws of penury and privation.&nbsp; By thus
delivering me from an impending impossibility most prejudicial to my
purse resources, you will confer on your humble servant a boon which
will be always vivid on the tablet of my breast, never to be effaced
until the period that I am sojurning on the stage of this sublunary
world&rsquo;s theatre.&rdquo;&nbsp; The petition goes on to explain
that all the unhappy petitioner&rsquo;s efforts to earn an honest livelihood
by the perspiration of his brow have been frustrated owing to the sins
committed by his soul in a former birth, and ends with religious reflections
and prayers.&nbsp; While this is presented to the Collector, the candidate
stands under a tree at some distance and rehearses, with palpitating
heart, the <i>salaam</i> he will make if admitted to the august presence.&nbsp;
Life and death seem to hang on the impression which may be produced
by that <i>salaam</i>.&nbsp; But the cousin&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s
brother-in-law sets other machinery in motion.&nbsp; He humbles himself
and makes up an old quarrel with the Naik; he flatters the butler till
that great man is pleased and promises his influence; and he wins the
Sheristedar&rsquo;s vote by telling him earnestly that all the district
knows he is virtually the Collector and whatever he recommends is done.&nbsp;
Nor is the <i>ayah</i> forgotten, for the <i>ayah</i> has access to
the <i>madam</i>, and by that route certain shameful matters affecting
a rival candidate will reach the <i>saheb</i>.&nbsp; Now, supposing
that the sins of a former birth fail to checkmate all these machinations,
and that the new arrival actually finds himself swimming in the unfathomed
bliss of a belt with a brass plate, and a princely income of seven Queen&rsquo;s
rupees every month, who could foretell that almost before a year has
passed he will again be floundering in the mire of disappointed ambition?&nbsp;
Yet so it is.&nbsp; He hears of another <i>Chupprassee</i> with only
eleven months&rsquo; service against his twelve, who has been promoted
to eight rupees, and immediately the canker of discontent eats into
his heart.&nbsp; Later on he finds that the cup of his happiness will
never be quite full until he gets ten rupees a month, and when he has
reached that giddy height, he will see dawning on his horizon the strange
and beautiful hope that he may be a Naik.&nbsp; It is a desperate ambition&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;He who ascends to mountain tops shall find<br />The highest
peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow;<br />He who surpasses or subdues
mankind<br />Must look down on the hate of those below.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Subordinate <i>Chupprassees</i> will slight his authority, his fellow
Naiks will disparage him, disappointed rivals will send in anonymous
petitions accusing him of all manner of villanies of which he is not
guilty, and, worse still, revealing the little briberies and oppressions
of which he is not innocent.&nbsp; But who of us learns wisdom in these
matters?&nbsp; The Naik soon comes to feel that if justice were done
to merit, he would be a Havildar.&nbsp; After he has attained that proud
distinction, he retires to &ldquo;husband out life&rsquo;s taper at
its close&rdquo; in the same old hut, amidst the same conglomerate of
relations, but nephews and nieces, and grandchildren have taken the
place of uncles and aunts and parents.&nbsp; The buffalo and the pariah
dog are apparently the same.&nbsp; Then the whole range of official
machinery is put in motion to reward his long and faithful services,
and the Governor in Council grants him the maximum pension of four rupees
a month, subject to the approval of the Viceroy, and he spends his few
remaining days in gratitude to the Sircar.&nbsp; But one thing rankles
in his mind.&nbsp; Babajee, not nearly so good-looking a fellow as himself,
rose to be a Jemadar.</p>
<p>Ambition has, however, another more golden career for an enterprising
and ingenious <i>Chupprassee</i>; for is he not the portal through which
the humble petitioner may have access to the Collector, whose smile
is prosperity and his frown destruction?&nbsp; And must not the hinges
of the portal be oiled that they may open smoothly?&nbsp; Therefore,
the inimitable Sir Ali Baba made a point of dismissing a <i>Chupprassee</i>
whenever he began to grow fat, and he was wise, but in applying the
rule you must have regard to the man&rsquo;s rank.&nbsp; The belt of
an ordinary peon may range from twenty to thirty inches according to
length of service, promotion to a Naik&rsquo;s position will add about
three inches, a Havildar will run to thirty-six or thirty-seven, and
a Jemadar must have something crabbed in his disposition if he does
not attain to forty-two inches.&nbsp; These are normal measurements,&mdash;they
consistent with strict integrity as understood in the East.&nbsp; By
the blessing of good temper and an easy life they may be slightly exceeded,
but the itching palm brings on a kind of dropsy easily recognisable
to the practised eye.&nbsp; I have seen an unjust Jemadar who might
have walked with Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Falstaff: My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.</p>
<p>Pistol: Two yards, and more.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THAT DHOBIE!</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I am an amateur philosopher and amuse myself detecting essence beneath
semblance and tracing the same principle running through things the
outward aspect of which is widely different.&nbsp; I have studied the
<i>Dhobie</i> in this spirit and find him to be nothing else than an
example of the abnormal development, under favourable conditions, of
a disposition which is not only common to humanity, but pervades the
whole animal kingdom.&nbsp; A puppy rending slippers, a child tearing
up its picture books, a mungoose killing twenty chickens to feed on
one, a freethinker demolishing ancient superstitions, what are they
all but <i>Dhobies</i> in embryo?&nbsp; Destruction is so much easier
than construction, and so much more rapid and abundant in its visible
results, that the devastator feels a jubilant joy in his work, of which
the tardy builder knows nothing.&nbsp; As the lightning scorns the oak,
as the fire triumphs over the venerable pile, as the swollen river scoffs
at the P. W. D., while arch after arch tumbles into its gurgling whirlpools,
so the <i>Dhobie</i>, dashing your cambric and fine linen against the
stones, shattering a button, fraying a hem, or rending a seam at every
stroke, feels a triumphant contempt for the miserable creature whose
plodding needle and thread put the garment together.&nbsp; This feeling
is the germ from which the <i>Dhobie</i> has grown.&nbsp; Day after
day he has stood before that great black stone and wreaked his rage
upon shirt and trowser and coat, and coat and trowser and shirt.&nbsp;
Then he has wrung them as if he were wringing the necks of poultry,
and fixed them on his drying line with thorns and spikes, and finally
he has taken the battered garments to his torture chamber and ploughed
them with his iron, longwise and crosswise and slantwise, and dropped
glowing cinders on their tenderest places.&nbsp; Son has followed father
through countless generations in cultivating this passion for destruction,
until it has become the monstrous growth which we see and shudder at
in the <i>Dhobie</i>.</p>
<p>But I find in him, at least, an illustration of another human infirmity.&nbsp;
He takes in hand to eradicate the dirt which defiles the garment.&nbsp;
But the one is closely mingled with the very fibres of the other, the
one is impalpable, the other bulky and substantial, and so the torrent
of his zealous rage unconsciously turns against the very substance of
that which he set himself lovingly to purge and restore to its primitive
purity.&nbsp; Indeed, I sometimes find that, while he has successfully
wrecked the garment, he has overlooked the dirt!&nbsp; Greater and better
men than the <i>Dhobie</i> are employed in the same way.</p>
<p>Such are the consolations of philosophy,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;But there was never yet philosopher<br />Who could endure
the toothache patiently,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>much less the <i>Dhobie</i>.&nbsp; He is not tolerable.&nbsp; Submit
to him we must, since resistance is futile; but his craven spirit makes
submission difficult and resignation impossible.&nbsp; If he had the
soul of a conqueror, if he wasted you like Attilla, if he flung his
iron into the clothes-basket and cried <i>V&aelig; victis</i>, then
a feeling of respect would soften the bitterness of the conquered; but
he conceals his ravages like the white ant, and you are betrayed in
the hour of need.&nbsp; When he comes in, limping and groaning under
his stupendous bundle, and lays out <i>khamees</i>, <i>pyatloon</i>,
and <i>pjama</i>, all so fair and decently folded, and delivers them
by tale in a voice whose monotonous cadence seems to tell of some undercurrent
of perennial sorrow in his life, who could guess what horrors his perfidious
heart is privy to?&nbsp; Next morning, when you spring from your tub
and shake out the great jail towel which is to wrap your shivering person
in its warm folds, lo! it yawns from end to end.&nbsp; There is nothing
but a border, a fringe, left.&nbsp; You fling on your clothes in unusual
haste, for it is mail day morning.&nbsp; The most indispensible of them
all has scarcely a remnant of a button remaining.&nbsp; You snatch up
another which seems in better condition, and scramble into it; but,
in the course of the day, a cold current of wind, penetrating where
it ought not, makes you aware of what your friends behind your back
have noticed for some time, <i>viz</i>., that the starch with which
a gaping rent had been carefully gummed together, that you might not
see it, has melted and given way.&nbsp; The thought of these things
makes a man feel like Vesuvius on the eve of an eruption; but you must
wait for relief till <i>Dhobie</i> day next week, and then the poltroon
has stayed at home, and sent his brother to report that he is suffering
from a severe stomachache.&nbsp; When the miscreant makes his next appearance
in person, he stands on one leg, with joined palms and a piteous bleat,
and pleads an <i>alibi</i>.&nbsp; He was absent about the marriage of
a relation, and his brother washed the clothes.&nbsp; So your lava falls
back into its crater, or, I am afraid, more often overflows the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>My theory of the <i>Dhobie</i> is a mere speculation, a hypothesis
deduced from broad, general principles.&nbsp; I do not pretend to have
established it by scientific observation, and am very tolerant towards
other theories, especially one which is supported by many competent
authorities, and explains the <i>Dhobie</i> by supposing a league between
him, the <i>dirzee</i> and the Boy.&nbsp; I think a close investigation
into the natural history of the shirt would go far to establish this
theory as at least partially true.&nbsp; In spite of the spread of &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;
shops, the shirt is still abundantly produced from the vernacular <i>dirzee</i>
sitting crossed-legged in the verandah, and each shirt will be found
to furnish him, on the average, with about a week&rsquo;s lucrative
employment.&nbsp; From his hands it passes to the <i>Dhobie</i> and
returns with the buttons wanting, the buttonholes widened to great gaping
fish-mouths, and the hems of the cuffs slightly frayed.&nbsp; The last
is the most significant fact, because it leads to the discovery of one
of those delicate adaptations which the student of nature has so often
occasion to admire; for, on examination, we discover that the hem had
been made with the least possible margin of cloth, as if to facilitate
the process of fraying.&nbsp; As we know that economy of material is
not an object with the <i>dirzee</i>, it has been maintained that there
is some connection here.&nbsp; Next the shirt passes into the hands
of the Boy, who takes his scissors and carefully pares the ragged edges
of the cuffs and collar.&nbsp; A few rotations of <i>Dhobie</i> and
Boy reduce the cuffs to the breadth of an inch, while the collar becomes
a circular saw which threatens to take your head off.&nbsp; Then you
fling the shirt to your Boy, and the <i>dirzee</i> is in requisition
again.&nbsp; Observation of white trousers will lead to similar results.&nbsp;
Between <i>Dhobie&rsquo;s</i> fury and Boy&rsquo;s repairs, the ends
of the legs retreat steadily upwards to your knees, and by the time
the Boy inherits them they are just his length.&nbsp; Remember, I do
not say I believe in this explanation of the <i>Dhobie</i>.&nbsp; I
give it for what it is worth.&nbsp; The subject is interesting and practical.</p>
<p>Did you ever open your handkerchief with the suspicion that you had
got a duster into your pocket by mistake, till the name of De Souza
blazoned on the corner showed you that you were wearing someone else&rsquo;s
property?&nbsp; An accident of this kind reveals a beneficent branch
of the <i>Dhobie&rsquo;s</i> business, one in which he comes to the
relief of needy respectability.&nbsp; Suppose yourself (if you can)
to be Mr. Lobo, enjoying the position of first violinist in a string
band which performs at Parsee weddings and on other festive occasions.&nbsp;
<i>Noblesse oblige</i>; you cannot evade the necessity for clean shirt-fronts,
ill able as your precarious income may be to meet it.&nbsp; In these
circumstances a <i>Dhobie</i> with good connections is what you require.&nbsp;
He finds you in shirts of the best quality at so much an evening, and
you are saved all risk and outlay of capital; you need keep no clothes
except a greenish black surtout and pants and an effective necktie.&nbsp;
In this way the wealth of the rich helps the want of the poor without
their feeling it, or knowing it&mdash;an excellent arrangement.&nbsp;
Sometimes, unfortunately, Mr. Lobo has a few clothes of his own, and
then, as I have hinted, the <i>Dhobie</i> may exchange them by mistake,
for he is uneducated and has much to remember; but, if you occasionally
suffer in this way, you gain in another, for Mr. Lobo&rsquo;s family
are skilful with the needle, and I have sent a torn garment to the washing
which returned skilfully repaired.</p>
<p>I suspect I am getting bitter and ironical, and it will be wise to
stop, for we are fickle creatures, the best of us, and it is quite possible
that, in the mild twilight of life, in the old country, I shall find
myself speaking benevolently of the <i>Dhobie</i>, and secretly wishing
I could hear his plaintive monotone again counting out my linen at four
rupees a hundred.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE AYAH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I was roaming among the flower-beds and bowers of a &ldquo;Peri&rsquo;s
Paradise,&rdquo; known in Bombay as The Ladies Gymkhana, when I was
startled by a voice like the sound of a passionate cart-wheel screaming
for grease.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lub ob my heart,&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;my
eshweet, don&rsquo;t crei! don&rsquo;t crei!&rdquo;&nbsp; The owner
of the voice was a woman with a negro type of countenance, as far as
I remember, but her figure has remained with me better than her face.&nbsp;
It was a portly figure, like that of a domestic duck in high condition,
and her gait was, as Mr. Onoocool Chunder Mookerjee would say, &ldquo;well
quadrate&rdquo; to the figure.&nbsp; Engulphed in her voluminous embrace
was a little cherub, with golden curls and blue eyes dewy with passing
tears&mdash;a pretty study of sunshine and shower.&nbsp; The great,
bare arms of the pachyderm were loaded with bangles of silver and glass,
which jingled with a warlike sound as she hugged her little charge and
plastered its pretty cheeks with great gurgling kisses, which made one
shudder and think involuntarily of the &ldquo;slime which the aspic
leaves upon the caves of Nile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of us have been Anglo-Indian
babies.&nbsp; Was there a time when we suffered caresses such as these?&nbsp;
What a happy thing it is that Lethe flows over us as we emerge from
infancy, and blots out all that was before.&nbsp; Another question has
been stirring in my mind since that scene.&nbsp; What feeling or motive
prompted those luscious blandishments?&nbsp; Was it simple hypocrisy?&nbsp;
I do not think so.&nbsp; The pure hypocrite is much rarer than shallow
people think, and, in any case, there was no inducement to make a display
in my presence.&nbsp; What influence could I possibly exercise over
the fortunes of that great female?&nbsp; A maternal hippopotamus in
the Zoo would as soon think of hugging a young giraffe to propitiate
the spectators.&nbsp; Of course you may take up the position that the
hypocrisy is practised all day before her mistress, and that the mere
momentum of habit carries it on at other times.&nbsp; This is plausible,
but I suspect that such a case would rather come under the fundamental
law that action and reaction are equal and opposite.&nbsp; Let us be
charitable and look for better reasons.&nbsp; The mere milk of human
kindness explains something, but not enough, and I am inclined to think
that the <i>Ayah</i> is the subject of an indiscriminate maternal emotion,
which runs where it can find a channel.&nbsp; The effect of culture
is to specialise our affections and remove us further and further from
the condition of the hen whose philoprogenitiveness embraces all chicks
and ducklings; so it may well be that the poor <i>Ayah</i>, who has
not had much culture, is better able than you or I to feel promiscuously
parental towards babies in general, at least, if she can connect them
in any way with herself.&nbsp; Towards babies in the care of another
<i>Ayah</i> she has no charity; they are the brood of a rival hen and
she would like to exterminate them.&nbsp; Again, we must love and hate,
if we live at all.&nbsp; The <i>Ayah&rsquo;s</i> horizon is not wide,
her sentiments are neither numerous nor complex, and her affections
are not trained to lay hold of the abstract or the historical.&nbsp;
If you question her, you will find that her heart does not bleed for
the poor negro, and she is not in the habit of regarding the Emperor
Caligula with abhorrence.&nbsp; She has one or two brothers or sisters,
but they are far away and have become almost as historical as Caligula.&nbsp;
In these circumstances, if she could not feel motherly towards babies,
what feeling would be left to her?&nbsp; And, perhaps, if we knew her
story, baby has a charm to open up an old channel, long since dry and
choked with the sands of a desert life, in which a gentle stream of
tenderness once flowed, with &ldquo;flowerets of Eden&rdquo; on its
banks, and fertilised her poor nature.&nbsp; But we do not know her
story.&nbsp; She says her husband is a cook.&nbsp; More about him she
does not say, but she hugs &ldquo;Sunny Baba&rdquo; to her breast and
kisses him and says that nothing shall ever part her from him till he
grows to be a great <i>saheb</i>, with plenty of pay, when he will pension
her and take care of her in her old age.&nbsp; And her eyes get moist,
for she means it more or less; but next day she catches a cold and refuses
food, saying that all her bones ache and her head is revolving; then
the horror of dying among strangers, &ldquo;unhouseled, disappointed,
unaneled,&rdquo; proves too much for the faithful creature, and she
disappears without notice, leaving her darling and its mother to look
out for another <i>Ayah.</i></p>
<p>It is a fortunate thing for us that the Ayah is able to conceive
such a devouring passion for our children, for it appears, from her
own statements, that but for this strong tie, nothing would induce her
to stay a day in our service where the constant broils with the other
servants, into which she is driven by her determination to be faithful
to her own mistress, make life almost unbearable to a peaceable woman
like her.&nbsp; The chief object of her righteous indignation is the
&ldquo;Bootrail.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is so reluctant to make any personal
complaint, that she would pass over his grudging her a little sugar
in her morning tea, but when he takes away a whole cupful for his own
children, conscience compels her to tell her mistress.&nbsp; She has
often pointed out to him that such conduct is not right, and tried to
reason with him, but he only insults her.&nbsp; The cook, being a notorious
inebriate, plays into the &ldquo;Bootrail&rsquo;s&rdquo; hand, on condition
that the latter will not tell upon him.&nbsp; Why did master send away
the dinner last night without touching it?&nbsp; Because the cook was
on the floor and the <i>matie</i> had to do the work.&nbsp; Chh!&nbsp;
Chh!&nbsp; Chh!&nbsp; It is very shameful and makes her feel so bad.&nbsp;
She herself is a teetotaler, as her mistress knows.&nbsp; That night
when she was found with a pillow in her arms instead of the baby, singing
to it and patting it to sleep, she had been smoking an English cheroot
which a friend had given her, and, as she is accustomed only to country
tobacco, it went to her head and stupefied her.&nbsp; Nothing would
induce her to drink spirits, but the other servants are not like her.&nbsp;
The <i>mussaul</i> is not a bad man, but the &ldquo;Bootrail&rsquo;s&rdquo;
example infects him too.&nbsp; He barters the kerosine oil at the petty
shop round the corner for arrack.&nbsp; As for the <i>hamal</i>, she
is tired of fighting with him.&nbsp; From this account of herself you
will be able to infer that the <i>Ayah</i> is not a favourite with the
other servants; but she is powerful, and so with oriental prudence they
veil their feelings.&nbsp; The butler indeed, tries to be proud and
risks ruin, but the <i>mussaul</i> truckles to her, and the cook, who
can spoil her dinner, and has some control over her, trims between her
and the butler.&nbsp; The <i>hamal</i> is impracticable, and the <i>chupprassees</i>
adhere to the party in power for the time being.</p>
<p>The <i>Ayah</i> is the &ldquo;society&rdquo; newspaper of small stations,
and is indispensable.&nbsp; The barber is the general newsagent, and,
as we part with our beards in the morning, we learn from him all particulars
of the dinner at the general&rsquo;s last night, and of the engagement
that resulted between the pretty Missy Baba and the captain who has
been so much about the house; also when the marriage is to take place,
if the captain can get out of his debts, the exact amount of which Old
Tom knows.&nbsp; He can tell us, too, the reason why she &ldquo;jawaubed&rdquo;
him so often, being put up to it by her mother in the interests of a
rival suitor, and he has authentic information as to the real grounds
of the mother&rsquo;s change of tactics.&nbsp; But Old Tom is himself
dependent on <i>Ayahs</i>, and there are matters beyond his range, matters
which even in an Indian station cannot reach us by any male channel.&nbsp;
They trickle from <i>madam</i> to <i>Ayah</i>, from <i>Ayah</i> to <i>Ayah</i>,
and from <i>Ayah</i> to <i>madam</i>.&nbsp; Thus they ooze from house
to house, and we are all saved from judging our neighbours by outward
appearances.</p>
<p>That scene in the Ladies&rsquo; Gymkhana comes back and haunts me.&nbsp;
What if the impress of those swarthy lips on that fair cheek are but
an outward symbol of impressions on a mind still as fair and pure, impressions
which soap and water will not purge away!&nbsp; Yes, it is so.&nbsp;
The <i>Ayah</i> hangs like a black cloud over and around the infant
mind, and its earliest outlooks on the world are tinted by that medium.&nbsp;
It lies with wondering blue eyes watching the coloured toys which she
dangles before it, and takes in the elements of form and colour.&nbsp;
She pats it to sleep, and, on the borders of dream-land, those &ldquo;sphere-born,
harmonious sisters, voice and verse,&rdquo; visit it in the form of
a plaintive ditty, which has for its simple burden,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Little, little fish<br />In bitter, bitter oil.<br />I will not part
with one of them for three pice and a half.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As its mind expands, new mysteries of the universe unfold themselves
through the same interpreter.&nbsp; It learns to see through the hollowness
of promises and threats before it knows the words in which they are
framed.&nbsp; With the knowledge of words comes the knowledge of their
use as means of concealing the truth and gaining its little ends.&nbsp;
Then the painful experience of discipline and punishment reveals the
same motherly figure in the new light of a protector and comforter,
and it learns to contrast her with the stern persons whom she has taught
it to call pa-pa and ma-ma.&nbsp; When they refuse anything on which
it has set its childish heart, it knows to whom to go for sympathy.&nbsp;
She will console it and teach little artifices, by which it may evade
or circumvent them.&nbsp; She supplies discipline of another kind, however,
and the yet simple trusting mind of the little Pantheist lives in terror
of papa&rsquo;s red-faced friend with the big stomach, who eats up ten
or twelve little children every day, and of the Borah with the great
box full of black ants, in which he shuts up naughty boys till the ants
pick the flesh from their disobedient bones.&nbsp; When it goes to the
bandstand, it gazes from a safe distance on the big drum, full of boys
and girls who would not let their hair be combed: it hears their groans
at every stroke of the terrible drumstick.&nbsp; Thus the religious
side of the tender nature is developed, and <i>Ayah</i> is the priestess.&nbsp;
Under the same guidance it will, as it grows older, tread paths of knowledge
which its parents never trod.&nbsp; Whither will they lead it?&nbsp;
We know not who never joined in the familiar chat of <i>Ayahs</i> and
servants, but imagination &ldquo;bodies forth the forms of things unseen&rdquo;
and shudders.&nbsp; Let us rejoice that a merciful superstition, which
regards the climate of India as deadly to European children, will step
in and save the little soul.&nbsp; The climate would do it no harm,
but there is a moral miasma more baneful than any which rises from the
pestilential swamps of the Terai, or the Bombay Flats.</p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;I have just taken another look at our present <i>Ayah</i>.&nbsp;
She is a little old woman from Goa, with humorous &ldquo;crow&rsquo;s
feet&rdquo; at the corners of her kind eyes.&nbsp; She is very retiring
and modest, and all the servants seem fond of her.&nbsp; It is evident
that nature is various, and we cannot all be types.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>R. R.&nbsp; THE PUNDIT</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Pundit is like duty; his cough rouses us from our beds in the
morning like the voice of conscience.&nbsp; Why must we pass examinations?&nbsp;
Not that we may know the language of the people, for it is matter of
daily observation, that of all the mysteries which perplex the humble
mind of the country bumpkin in this land, causing him to scratch his&mdash;well,
not his head&mdash;there is none which he gives up as hopeless sooner
than the strange sounds addressed to him by the young <i>saheb</i> who
has just passed his higher standard.&nbsp; He joins his palms in loyal
acquiescence, and asserts that the gentleman is his father and mother.&nbsp;
It was Swift, was it not, who suggested that all high offices of state
should be filled by lot, because the result would be on the whole quite
as satisfactory as that obtained by the present system, while disappointed
candidates would curse Fortune, who has a broader back than the Prime
Minister.&nbsp; No doubt examinations were introduced on the same sort
of principle, to act as a buffer between the train of candidates and
the engine of Government.&nbsp; That the examination often comes after
instead of before the appointment is a necessary modification, without
which no room would be left for the play of those kindly feelings for
kith and kin which we bitterly nickname nepotism.&nbsp; Under this arrangement
I have known a needy <i>nepos</i> of H. E. himself provided with a salary
for a whole year, till he could hold the examination at bay no longer,
when he evacuated his position and retreated to his friends.&nbsp; Whatever
the explanation of the matter may be, it falls to the lot of most of
us to experience the Pundit.&nbsp; I may remark here that he is very
commonly called a Moonshee, on the same principle on which a horse is
not called a cow.&nbsp; The Pundit is not a Moonshee.&nbsp; The Moonshee
is a follower of the Prophet and teaches Oordoo, or Hindoostanee, while
the Pundit is a Brahmin and instructs you in Marathee or Gujarathee.&nbsp;
The Moonshee struggles to get you to disgorge the sound <i>ghain</i>
and leads you through the enchanted mazes of the Bagh-o-Bahar; the Pundit
distinguishes between the <i>kurmunnee</i> and the <i>kurturree prayog</i>,
and has many knotty points of mythology to expound, in order that you
may rightly understand his idioms and appreciate his proverbial sayings.&nbsp;
Of Pundits there are three species, quite distinct from each other.&nbsp;
The first I would recommend if your object should, by any chance, be
to learn to speak the language intelligibly; but he knows no English,
and you must gird yourself to work if you employ him.&nbsp; This sort
of teacher does not suit the tastes of the present generation and is
dying out, I think.&nbsp; The second kind is invaluable if your purpose
is to pass an examination.&nbsp; He knows English well, dresses smartly,
and is altogether a superior sort of person to the last, especially
in his own estimation; but appearances are delusive, and the sign that
really distinguishes him from other Pundits is that he enjoys in a high
degree the esteem and confidence of a native member of the examining
body.&nbsp; Another unfailing characteristic of him is that he requires
a monstrous monthly stipend and the promise of a handsome <i>douceur</i>
if you pass; but then you have the satisfaction of knowing that, if
you fulfil the conditions, that happy result is certain.&nbsp; His system
leaves no room for failure.&nbsp; Some people regard this man as a myth,
but I have had authentic accounts of him from numerous young gentlemen
who had failed in their examinations simply, as they themselves assured
me, because they did not employ him.&nbsp; The third class consists
of young men, aspirants to University honours and others, with some
knowledge of English and a laudable desire to improve it by conversation
with Englishmen.&nbsp; I do not know for what purpose this sort of Pundit
is useful.</p>
<p>Old Ragunath Rao belonged to the first of these three classes.&nbsp;
He knew no English, and he desired to know none, neither English words
nor English thoughts.&nbsp; He was an undiluted Brahmin.&nbsp; He had
taught a former generation of Anglo-Indians, long since retired, or
in their graves, and one or two of these, who were very religious men,
had impressed him by their characters so deeply that he always spoke
of them with reverence, as not men but divinities.&nbsp; The tide had
ebbed away from him, and no one employed him now: he was very poor.&nbsp;
His face was heavy, his ears like beef-steaks, with a fringe of long
bristles round the edge and a bushy tuft of the same sprouting from
the inside.&nbsp; His features were not pleasing, but strongly expressive
of character, stubborn Hindoo character, self-disciplined, self-satisfied,
and in a set attitude of defence against the invasions of novelty.&nbsp;
His athletic intellect was exercised in all manner of curious questions.&nbsp;
The only matter about which it never concerned itself was reality, the
existence of which he probably doubted.&nbsp; At any rate, he considered
truth, right, wrong, to be subjects for speculative philosophy.&nbsp;
As a practical man, he had minutely acquainted himself with all the
things that behoved to be believed by an orthodox Brahmin, and he was
not the man to give way to mere facts.&nbsp; This frame of mind begot
in him a large tolerance, for what possible connection could there be
between what it became him to believe and what it became you to believe?&nbsp;
If his son had turned a Christian, he could have swung him from a tree
by his thumbs and toes and flagellated him from below with acute pleasure;
but if you expounded Christian doctrines and morals to him, he would
listen with profound admiration.&nbsp; A Christian who lived up to his
creed he respected unfeignedly.&nbsp; Strange old man! like one of his
own idols, not modelled upon anything that is in heaven or on earth.&nbsp;
Are they not, he and the idol, the fruit of the same tree?</p>
<p>What memories rise out of their graves at the mention of old Ragunath!&nbsp;
Just about a quarter of an hour after his time he comes slowly up the
steps, panting for breath, and leaving his shoes at the door, walks
in with a <i>quasi</i> courtly salutation.&nbsp; As soon as he can recover
his voice, he tells of a hair-breadth escape from sudden death.&nbsp;
As he was crossing the road, a carriage and pair bore down on him.&nbsp;
He stood petrified with terror, not knowing whether to hurry forward
or turn back, but just as the horses were upon him, he made a frantic
effort and gained the side-walk!&nbsp; He infers that his time to die
had not arrived, and takes the occasion to impart some information about
the planets and their influence on human destinies.&nbsp; Then we seat
ourselves, and he takes my exercise (translation from Grant Duff), and
reads it slowly in a muffled voice, which is forced to make its exit
by the nose, the mouth being occupied with cardamoms or betel nut.&nbsp;
As he reads he corrects with a pencil, but gives no explanation of his
corrections; for you must not expect him to teach: he is a mine simply,
in which you must dig for what you want.&nbsp; One thing you may depend
on, that whatever you extract from that mine will be worth having, indigenous
treasure, current wherever Hindoo thought is moving, very different
from the foreign-flavoured pabulum with which your English smattering
instructor charges his feeding bottle.&nbsp; The exercise gives Ragunath
an opportunity of digressing into some traditional incident of Maratha
history which escaped the researches of Mr. Grant Duff, an incident
generally in which Maratha cunning (<i>sagacity</i> he calls it) triumphed
over English stupidity.&nbsp; After the exercise comes the inevitable
petition.&nbsp; I do not remember the subject of it&mdash;some grievance
no doubt connected with hereditary rights in land&mdash;but it matters
little; the whole document might as well be a Moabite stone recording
the wars of Mesha with Jehoram, for not a letter of it stands out recognisable
to my eyes.&nbsp; Indeed, no letter, or word either, stands out at all;
the scribe seems never to have lifted his pen from his paper except
for ink, and that generally in the middle of a word.&nbsp; However,
Ragunath takes the greasy paper from my hand, remarks that the handwriting
is good, and starts off reading it, or, I should say, intoning it, on
exactly the same principle, <i>viz</i>., never pausing except for breath,
and that generally in the middle of a word.&nbsp; Then we read together
the &ldquo;Garland of Pearls,&rdquo; which he illuminates with notes
of his own.&nbsp; Speaking of old age, he remarks that the hair of some
men ripens sooner than that of others, but that our heads must all grow
grey as our brains get thin.&nbsp; He discourses on anatomy, food, digestion,
the advisability of lying down on the left side for twenty minutes after
meals, and on many things in heaven and earth which are not dreamed
of in our philosophy.&nbsp; As the morning wears on, the old man, who
is not accustomed to sitting on chairs, begins to fidget, and shows
signs of a desire to gather up his feet into the seat and nurse them.&nbsp;
At last drowsiness overtakes him.&nbsp; His eyes are open, but his mind
is asleep, and I may do as I please with grammar and idiom: even when
I yawn, he omits to snap his fingers and lets the devil skip down my
throat.&nbsp; When he awakes he suggests that it is time to stop, and
asks leave for the next day, as he has to renew his sacred thread.&nbsp;
Poor old Ragunath!&nbsp; I fear he has gone long since to the burning
ground on the banks of the Moota Moola.</p>
<p>Before we part let me give you a hint.&nbsp; Always keep a separate
chair for your Pundit, one isolated on glass legs, if possible.&nbsp;
Even this does not afford complete security, for he now and then detects
one of the many insects which you have watched coursing up and down
his white scarf, and picking it off with his finger and thumb, puts
it on the floor.&nbsp; His creed forbids him to take the life of anything
which may possibly be the corporeal habitation of the spirit of one
of his deceased ancestors, but these little insects irritate him, so
he deports them as we do our loafers.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>HURREE, THE DIRZEE</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A warm altercation is going on in the verandah.&nbsp; A little human
animal, with a very large red turban on his little head, stuck full
of pins and threaded needles, stands on all fours over a garment of
an unmentionable kind, which I recognise as belonging to me, and a piece
of cloth lies before him, out of which he has cut a figure resembling
the said garment.&nbsp; The scissors with which the operation was performed
are still lying open upon the ground before him.&nbsp; His head is thrown
so far back that the great turban rests between his shoulder blades,
his brow is corrugated with perplexity, his mouth a little open, as
if his lower jaw could not quite follow the rest of his upturned face.&nbsp;
Hurree cannot know much about toothache.&nbsp; What would I not give
for that set of incisors, regular as the teeth of a saw, and all as
red as a fresh brick!&nbsp; I suppose the current quid of <i>pan suparee</i>
is temporarily stowed away under that swelling in the left cheek, where
the fierce black patch of whisker grows.&nbsp; The survival of a partial
cheek pouch in some branches of the human race is a point that escaped
Darwin.&nbsp; But I am digressing into reflections.&nbsp; To return:
a lady is standing over the quadruped and evidently expressing serious
displeasure in some form of that domestic language which we call Hindoostanee,
with variations.&nbsp; The charge she lays against him seems to be that
he has, in disregard of explicit instructions and defiance of common
sense, made a blunder to which her whole past experience in India furnishes
no parallel, and which has resulted in the total destruction of a whole
piece of costly material, and the wreck of a garment for want of which
the <i>saheb</i> (that is myself) will be put to a degree of inconvenience
which cannot be estimated in rupees, and will most certainly be provoked
to an outbreak of indignation too terrible to be described.&nbsp; So
little do we know ourselves!&nbsp; I had no idea I harboured such a
temper.&nbsp; However, Hurree does not tremble, but pleads that it was
necessary to make the garment &ldquo;leetle silope,&rdquo; and though
he admits that the slope is too great, he thinks the mistake can be
remedied, and is pulling the cloth to see if it will not stretch to
the required shape.&nbsp; Failing this, he has other remedies of a technical
kind to suggest.&nbsp; I do not understand these matters, and cannot
interpret his argument, but he puts his fingers on the floor and flings
himself lightly to the other side of the cloth, to point out where he
proposes to have a &ldquo;fals hame,&rdquo; or some other device.&nbsp;
She rejects the proposal with scorn, and again impresses him with the
consequences of his wicked blunder.&nbsp; At last I am glad to see that
a compromise is effected, and the little man settles himself in the
middle of a small carpet and locks his legs together so that his shins
form an X and he sits on his feet.&nbsp; In this position he will ply
his needle for the rest of the day at a rate inversely proportional
to the distance of his mistress.&nbsp; When she retires for her afternoon
<i>siesta</i> the needle will nap too.&nbsp; Then he will take out a
little <i>Vade Mecum</i>, which is never absent from his waistband,
and unroll it.&nbsp; It is many-coloured and contains little pockets,
one for fragments of the spicy areca, one for the small tin box which
contains fresh lime, one for cloves, one for cardamoms, and so on.&nbsp;
He will put a little of this and a little of that into his palm, then
roll them all up in a betel leaf out of another pocket, and push the
parcel into his mouth.&nbsp; Thus refreshed he will go to work again,
not, however, upon the garment to which he is now devoted, but upon
a roll of coloured stuffs on which he is at the present moment sitting.&nbsp;
You see, times are hard and Hurree has a large family, so he is obliged
to eke out his salary by contract work for the <i>mussaul</i>.&nbsp;
His work suffers from other interruptions.&nbsp; When the carriage of
a visitor is heard, he has to awaken the <i>chupprassee</i> on duty
at the door, and on his own account he goes out to drink water at least
as often as the <i>chupprassee</i> himself.&nbsp; As the day draws near
its close, he watches the shadow like a hireling, and when it touches
the foot of the long arm chair, he springs to his feet, rolls up his
rags and threads into a bundle, and trips gaily out.&nbsp; As he does
so you will observe that his legs are bandy, the knees refusing to approach
each other.&nbsp; This is the result of the position in which he spends
his days.</p>
<p>This is how we clothe ourselves in our Indian empire.&nbsp; Our smooth
and comfortable <i>khakee</i> suits, our ample <i>pyjamas</i>, the cool
white jackets in which we dine, in this way are they brought about.&nbsp;
But you must not allow yourself to think of the <i>Dirzee</i> simply
as an agency for producing clothes.&nbsp; Life is not made up of such
simplicities.&nbsp; The <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of that mango
tree lies without doubt in the chalice of nectar, called &ldquo;mango
fool,&rdquo; with which Domingo appeases me when he guesses that his
enormities have gone beyond the limits even of my endurance; but I see
that thirty-seven candidates for the place of the <i>chupprassee</i>
who went on leave yesterday have encamped under its shade, that they
may watch for my face in the verandah.&nbsp; The trespassing goat also
has browsed on its leaves, and from the shelter of its branches the
Magpie Robin pours that stream of song which, just before the dawning
of the day, in the cloudy border land between sleeping and waking flows
over my soul.&nbsp; But I shall never really know the place that tree
has filled in my life, unless someone cuts it down and gives me a full
view, from my easy chair, of the dirty brick-burners&rsquo; hut, with
the poisonous film of blue smoke playing over the kiln, and the family
of pariah puppies below, sporting with the sun-dried remains of a fowl,
which deceased in my yard and was purloined by their gaunt mother.&nbsp;
Now let imagination blot out the <i>Dirzee</i>.&nbsp; Remove him from
the verandah.&nbsp; Take up his carpet and sweep away the litter.&nbsp;
What a strange void there is in the place!&nbsp; Eliminate him from
a lady&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Let nine o&rsquo;clock strike, but bring no
stealthy footstep to the door, no muffled voice making respectful application
for his <i>Kam</i>.&nbsp; From nine to ten breakfast will fill the breach,
and you may allow another hour for the butler&rsquo;s account and the
godown; but there is still a yawning chasm of at least two hours between
eleven and tiffin.&nbsp; I cannot bridge it.&nbsp; Imagination strikes
work.&nbsp; The joyful sound of the Borah&rsquo;s voice brings promise
of relief; but no! for what interest can there be in the Borah if you
have no <i>Dirzee</i>?&nbsp; In the spirit of fair play, however, I
must mention that my wife does not endorse all this.&nbsp; On the contrary,
she tells me (she has a terse way of speaking) that it is &ldquo;rank
bosh.&rdquo;&nbsp; She declares that the <i>Dirzee</i> is the bane of
her life, that he is worse than a fly, that she cannot sit down to the
piano for five minutes but he comes buzzing round for black thread,
or white thread, or mother-o-pearl buttons, or hooks and eyes, that
every evening for the last month he has watched her getting ready for
to drive, and just as her foot was on the carriage step, has reminded
her, with a cough, that his work was finished and he had nothing to
do.&nbsp; If she could only do without him, she would send him about
his business and be the happiest woman in the world, for she could devote
the whole day to music and painting and the improvement of her mind.&nbsp;
Of course I assent.&nbsp; That is a very commendable way of thinking
about the matter.&nbsp; But, as an amateur philosopher, I warn you never
to let yourself get under practical bondage to such notions.&nbsp; I
tell you when you betake yourself to music or painting, carpentry or
gardening, as a means of getting through the day, you are sapping your
mental constitution and shortening your life: unless you are sustained
by more than ordinary littleness of mind you will never see threescore
and ten.&nbsp; All these things are good in proportion as you have difficulty
in finding time for them.&nbsp; When you have to rise early in the morning
and work hard to make a little leisure for your favourite hobby, then
you are getting its blessing.&nbsp; Now, the <i>Dirzee</i> is not a
means of killing time.&nbsp; On the contrary, I see that he compels
his mistress to take thought how she may save time alive, if she wishes
to get anything done.&nbsp; He hurries the day along and scatters its
hours, so that <i>ennui</i> cannot find an empty minute to lurk in.&nbsp;
I do not deny that he is the occasion of a few provocations, and the
simile of the fly is just; but are not provocations an element in the
interest of every pursuit, the pepper which flavours all pleasant occupation?&nbsp;
I collect butterflies, and my friends think I am a man to be envied
because I have such a taste.&nbsp; Do they suppose a butterfly catcher
has no provocations?&nbsp; Was it seventeen or seventy times (I forget)
in one page that I laid down my pen, put off my spectacles and caught
up my net to rush after that brute of a <i>Papilio polymnestor</i>,
who just came to the <i>duranta</i> flowers to flout me and skip over
the wall into the next garden?&nbsp; And does anyone but a butterfly
hunter know how it feels to open your cabinet drawers just a few hours
after the ants have got the news that the camphor is done?&nbsp; Does
anyone but an entomologist know the grub of <i>Dermestes intolerabilis</i>?&nbsp;
Why should a collection of butterflies be called an object of perennial
interest and delight, and the <i>Dirzee</i> an unmitigated provocation?&nbsp;
They are both of one family.&nbsp; Nothing is unmitigated in this world.</p>
<p>Maria Graham tells us that in her time &ldquo;the <i>Dirdjees</i>,
or tailors, in Bombay&rdquo; were &ldquo;Hindoos of respectable caste,&rdquo;
but in these days the Goanese, who has not capacity to be a butler or
cook, becomes a <i>Dirzee</i>, and in Bombay I have seen Bunniah <i>Dirzees</i>.&nbsp;
Hurree can hold his own against these, I doubt not, but the advancing
tide of civilization is surely crumbling down his foundations.&nbsp;
It is not only the &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; shop in Bombay that takes the
bread out of his month, but in the smallest and most remote stations,
Narayen, &ldquo;Tailor, Outfitter, Milliner, and Dressmaker,&rdquo;
hangs out his sign-board, and under it pale, consumptive youths of the
Shimpee caste bend over their work by lamplight, and sing the song of
the shirt to the whirr-rr-rr of sewing machines.&nbsp; And as Hurree
goes by on his way home, his prophetic soul tells him that his son will
not live the happy and independent life which has fallen to his lot.&nbsp;
But he has a bulwark still in the <i>dhobie</i>, for the &ldquo;Tailor
and Outfitter&rdquo; will not repair frayed cuffs, and the sewing machine
cannot put on buttons.&nbsp; And Hurree is not ungrateful, for I observe
that, when the <i>dhobie</i> delivers up your clothes in a state which
requires the <i>Dirzee</i>, the <i>Dirzee</i> always gives them back
in a condition which demands the <i>dhobie.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>THE MALEE</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Another custom is their sitting always on the ground with
their knees up to their chins, which I know not how to account for.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daniel
Johnson</i></p>
<p>I have been watching Thomas Otway, gardener.&nbsp; His coat hangs
on a tree hard by, and he, standing in his shirt sleeves, is slaughtering
regiments of weeds with a long hoe.&nbsp; When they are all uprooted
and prostrate, he changes his weapon for a fork, with which he tosses
them about and shakes them free of soil and gathers them into heaps.&nbsp;
Then he brings a wheel-barrow, and, piling them into it until it can
hold no more, goes off at a trot.&nbsp; I am told his only fault is
that he is <i>slow.</i></p>
<p>I have also stood watching Peelajee.&nbsp; He, too, is a gardener,
called by his own people a <i>Malee</i>, and by us, familiarly, a <i>Molly</i>.&nbsp;
He sits in an attitude not easy to describe, but familiar to all who
have resided in the otiose East.&nbsp; You will get at it by sitting
on your own heels and putting your knees into your armpits.&nbsp; In
this position Peelajee can spend the day with much comfort, which is
a wonderful provision of nature.&nbsp; At the present moment he also
is engaged in the operation of weeding.&nbsp; In his right hand is a
small species of sickle called a <i>koorpee</i>, with which he investigates
the root of each weed as a snipe feels in the mud for worms; then with
his left hand he pulls it out, gently shakes the earth off it, and contributes
it to a small heap beside him.&nbsp; When he has cleared a little space
round him, he moves on like a toad, without lifting himself.&nbsp; He
enlivens his toil by exchanging remarks upon the weather as affecting
the price of grain, the infirmity of my temper and other topics of personal
interest, with an assistant, whom he persuaded me to engage by the day,
pleading the laborious nature of this work of weeding.&nbsp; When two
or three square yards have been cleared, they both go away, and return
in half an hour with a very small basket, which one holds while the
other fills it with the weeds.&nbsp; Then the assistant balances it
on his head, and sets out at one mile an hour for the garden gate, where
he empties it on the roadside.&nbsp; Then he returns at the same rate,
with the empty basket on his head, to Peelajee, who is occupied sitting
waiting for him.</p>
<p>It is clear that there may be two ways of doing the same thing.&nbsp;
I have no doubt there is much to be said for both, but, upon the whole,
the advantage seems to lie with the <i>Malee</i>.&nbsp; Otway does as
much work in a day as Peelajee does in a week.&nbsp; But why should
a day be better than a week?&nbsp; If you turn the thing round, and
look at the other side of it, you will find that Otway costs three shillings
a day and Peelajee two rupees a week.&nbsp; So, if you are in a hurry,
you can employ half a dozen Peelajees, and feel that you are making
six families in the world happy instead of only one.&nbsp; And I am
sure the calm and peaceful air of Peelajee, as he moves about the garden,
must be good for the soul and promote longevity.&nbsp; I hate bustle,
and I can vouch for Peelajee that he never bustles.&nbsp; However, there
is no need of odious comparisons.&nbsp; There is a time for everything
under the sun, and a place.&nbsp; Here, in India, we have need of Peelajee.&nbsp;
He is a necessary part of the machinery by which our exile life is made
to be the graceful thing it often is.&nbsp; I pass by bungalow after
bungalow, each in its own little paradise, and look upon the green lawn
successfully defying an unkind climate, the islands of mingled foliage
in profuse, confused beauty, the gay flower beds, the clean gravel paths
with their trim borders, the grotto in a shady corner, where fern and
moss mingle, all dripping as if from recent showers and make you feel
cool in spite of all thermometers, and I say to myself, &ldquo;Without
the <i>Malee</i> all this would not be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither with the
<i>Malee</i> alone would this be, but something very different.&nbsp;
I admit that.&nbsp; But is not this just one secret of the beneficent
influence he has on us?&nbsp; Your &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; gardener is
altogether too good.&nbsp; He obliterates you&mdash;reduces you to a
spectator.&nbsp; But keeping a <i>Malee</i> draws you out, for he compels
you to look after him, and if you are to look after him, you must know
something about his art, and if you do not know, you must learn.&nbsp;
So we Anglo-Indians are gardeners almost to a man, and spend many pure,
happy hours with the pruning shears and the budding knife, and this
we owe to the <i>Malee</i>.&nbsp; When I say you must look after him,
I do not disparage his skill; he is neat handed and knows many things;
but his taste is elementary.&nbsp; He has an eye for symmetry, and can
take delight in squares and circles and parallel lines; but the more
subtle beauties of unsymmetrical figures and curves which seem to obey
no law are hid from him.&nbsp; He loves bright tints especially red
and yellow, with a boy&rsquo;s love for sugar; he cannot have too much
of them; but he has no organ for perceiving harmony in colour, and so
the want of it does not pain him.&nbsp; The chief avenue, however, by
which the delights of a gardener&rsquo;s life reach him is the sense
of smell.&nbsp; He revels in sweet odours; but here, too, he seeks for
strength rather than what we call delicacy.&nbsp; In short, the enjoyment
which he finds in the tones of his native <i>tom-tom</i> may be taken
as typical of all his pleasures.&nbsp; I find however, that Peelajee
understands the principles of toleration, and, recognising that he caters
for my pleasure rather than his own, is quite willing to abandon his
favourite yellow marigold and luscious jasmine for the <i>pooteena</i>
and the <i>beebeena</i> and the <i>fullax</i>.&nbsp; But perhaps you
do not know these flowers by their Indian names.&nbsp; We call them
<i>petunia</i>, <i>verbena</i>, and <i>phlox</i>.&nbsp; This is, doubtless,
another indication of our Aryan brotherhood.</p>
<p>Peelajee is industrious after the Oriental method&mdash;that is to
say, he is always doing something, but is economical of energy rather
than time.&nbsp; If there are more ways than one of doing a thing, he
has an unerring instinct which guides him to choose the one that costs
least trouble.&nbsp; He is a fatalist in philosophy, and this helps
him too.&nbsp; For example, when he transplants a rose bush, he saves
himself the trouble of digging very deep by breaking the root, for if
the plant is to live it will live, and if it is to die it will die.&nbsp;
Some plants live, he remarks, and some plants die.&nbsp; The second
half of this aphorism is only too true.&nbsp; In fact, many of my best
plants not only die, but suddenly and entirely disappear.&nbsp; If I
question Peelajee, he denies that I ever had them, and treats me as
a dreamer of dreams.&nbsp; I would not be uncharitable, but a little
suspicion, like a mouse, lurks in the crevices of my mind that Peelajee
surreptitiously carries on a small business as a seedsman and nursery
gardener, and I know that in his simple mind he is so identified with
his master that <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> blend, as it were, into
one.&nbsp; I am restrained from probing into the matter by a sensitiveness
about certain other mysteries which may be bound up with this, and about
which I have always suppressed my curiosity.&nbsp; For example, where
do the beautiful flowers which decorate my table grow?&nbsp; Not altogether
in my garden.&nbsp; So much I know: more than that I think it prudent
not to know.&nbsp; For this reason, as I said, I forbear to make close
scrutiny into what may be called the undercurrent of Peelajee&rsquo;s
operations, but I notice that he always has in hand large beds of cuttings
from my best roses and crotons, and these flourish up to a certain point,
after which I lose all trace of them.&nbsp; He says that an insidious
caterpillar attacks their roots, so that they all grow black and wither
away suddenly.&nbsp; I fall upon him and tell him that he is to blame.&nbsp;
He protests that he cannot control underground caterpillars.&nbsp; He
knows that I suspect, and I suspect that he knows, but a veil of dissimulation,
however transparent, averts a crisis, so we fence for a time till he
understands clearly that, when he propagates my plants, he must reserve
a decent number for me.</p>
<p>Griffins and travelling M.P.s are liable to suppose that the <i>Malee</i>
is a gardener, and <i>ergo</i> that you keep him to attend to your garden.&nbsp;
This is an error.&nbsp; He is a gardener, of course, but the primary
use of him is to produce flowers for your table, and you need him most
when you have no garden.&nbsp; A high-class <i>Malee</i> of good family
and connections is quite independent of a garden.&nbsp; It seems necessary,
however, that your neighbours should have gardens.</p>
<p>The highest branch of the <i>Malee&rsquo;s</i> art is the making
of nosegays, from the little &ldquo;buttonhole,&rdquo; which is equivalent
to a cough on occasions when <i>baksheesh</i> seems possible, to the
great valedictory or Christmas bouquet.&nbsp; The manner of making these
is as follows.&nbsp; First you gather your flowers, cutting the stalks
as short as possible, and tie each one firmly to an artificial stalk
of thin bamboo.&nbsp; Then you select some large and striking flower
for a centre, and range the rest round it in rings of beautiful colours.&nbsp;
If your bull&rsquo;s eye is a sunflower, then you may gird it with a
broad belt of red roses.&nbsp; Yellow marigolds may follow, then another
ring of red roses, then lilac bougainvillea, then something blue, after
which you may have a circle of white jasmine, and so on.&nbsp; Finally,
you fringe the whole with green leaves, bind it together with pack thread,
and tie it to the end of a short stick.&nbsp; If the odour of rose,
jasmine, chumpa, oleander, etc., is not sufficient, you can mix a good
quantity of mignonette with the leaves on the outside, but, in any case,
it is best to sprinkle the whole profusely with rose water.&nbsp; This
will make a bouquet fit to present to a Commissioner.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>THE BHEESTEE</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The <i>malee</i> has an ally called the <i>Bheestee</i>.&nbsp; If
you ask, Who is the <i>Bheestee</i>?&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; <i>Behisht</i>
in the Persian tongue means Paradise, and a <i>Bihishtee</i> is, therefore,
an inhabitant of Paradise, a cherub, a seraph, an angel of mercy.&nbsp;
He has no wings; the painters have misconceived him; but his back is
bowed down with the burden of a great goat-skin swollen to bursting
with the elixir of life.&nbsp; He walks the land when the heaven above
him is brass and the earth iron, when the trees and shrubs are languishing
and the last blade of grass has given up the struggle for life, when
the very roses smell only of dust, and all day long the roaring &ldquo;dust
devils&rdquo; waltz about the fields, whirling leaf and grass and corn
stalk round and round and up and away into the regions of the sky; and
he unties a leather thong which chokes the throat of his goat-skin just
where the head of the poor old goat was cut off, and straight-way, with
a life-reviving gurgle, the stream called <i>thunda panee</i> gushes
forth, and plant and shrub lift up their heads and the garden smiles
again.&nbsp; The dust also on the roads is laid and a grateful incense
rises from the ground, the sides of the water chatty grow dark and moist
and cool themselves in the hot air, and through the dripping interstices
of the <i>khuskhus</i> tattie a chilly fragrance creeps into the room,
causing the mercury in the thermometer to retreat from its proud place.&nbsp;
Nay, the seraph finds his way to your very bath-room, and discharging
a cataract into the great tub, leaves it heaving like the ocean after
a storm.&nbsp; When you follow him there, you will thank that nameless
poet who gave our humble Aquarius the title he bears.&nbsp; Surely in
the world there can be no luxury like an Indian &ldquo;tub&rdquo; after
a long march, or a morning&rsquo;s shooting, in the month of May.&nbsp;
I know of none.&nbsp; Wallace says that to eat a <i>durian</i> is a
new sensation, worth a voyage to the East to experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
rich, butterlike custard, highly flavoured with almonds, gives the best
general idea of it, but intermingled with it come wafts of flavour which
call to mind cream cheese, onion sauce, brown sherry, and other incongruities.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If this is true, then eating a <i>durian</i> must, in its way, be something
like having a tub.&nbsp; That certainly is a new sensation.&nbsp; I
cannot tell what gives the best general idea of it, but there are mingled
with it many wafts of a vigorous enjoyment, which touch you, I think,
at a higher point in your nature than cream cheese or onion sauce.&nbsp;
There is first the enfranchisement of your steaming limbs from gaiter
and shooting boot, buckskin and flannel; then the steeping of your sodden
head in the pellucid depth, with bubaline snortings and expirations
of satisfaction; then, as the first cold stream from the &ldquo;tinpot&rdquo;
courses down your spine, what electric thrills start from a dozen ganglia
and flush your whole nervous system with new life!&nbsp; Finally, there
is the plunge and the wallow and the splash, with a feeling of kinship
to the porpoise in its joy, under the influence of which the most silent
man becomes vocal and makes the walls of the narrow <i>ghoosulkhana</i>
resound with amorous, or patriotic, song.&nbsp; A flavour of sadness
mingles here, for you must come out at last, but the ample gaol towel
receives you in its warm embrace and a glow of contentment pervades
your frame, which seems like a special preparation for the soothing
touch of cool, clean linen, and white duck, or smooth <i>khakee</i>.&nbsp;
And even before the voice of the butler is heard at the door, your olfactory
nerves, quickened by the tonic of the tub, have told you what he is
going to say.</p>
<p>Some people in India always bathe in hot water, not for their sins,
but because they like it.&nbsp; At least, so they say, and it may be
true, for I have been told that you may get a taste even for drinking
hot water if you keep at it long enough.</p>
<p>The <i>Bheestee</i> is the only one of all our servants who never
asks for a rise of pay on account of the increase of his family.&nbsp;
But he is not like the other servants.&nbsp; We do not think of him
as one of the household.&nbsp; We do not know his name, and seldom or
never speak to him; but I follow him about, as you would some little
animal, and observe his ways.&nbsp; I find that he always stands on
his left leg, which is like an iron gate-post, and props himself with
his right.&nbsp; I cannot discover whether he straightens out when he
goes home at night, but when visible in the daytime, he is always bowed,
either under the weight of his <i>mussuk</i> or the recollection of
it.&nbsp; The constant application of that great cold poultice must
surely bring on chronic lumbago, but he does not complain.&nbsp; I notice,
however, that his waist is always bound about with many folds of unbleached
cotton cloth and other protective gear.&nbsp; The place to study him
to advantage is the <i>bowrie</i>, or station well, in a little hollow
at the foot of a hill.&nbsp; Of course there are many wells, but some
have a bad reputation for guineaworm, and some are brackish, and some
are jealously guarded by the Brahmins, who curse the <i>Bheestee</i>
if he approaches, and some are for low caste people.&nbsp; This well
is used by the station generally, and the water of it is very &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Any native in the place will tell you that if you drink of this well
you will always have an appetite for your meals and digest your food.&nbsp;
It is circular and surrounded by a strong parapet wall, over which,
if you peep cautiously into the dark abyss, you may catch a sight of
the wary tortoise, which shares with a score or so of gigantic frogs
the task of keeping the water &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was introduced
for the purpose by a thoughtful <i>Bheestee</i>: the frogs fell in.&nbsp;
Wild pigeons have their nests in holes in the sides of the well.&nbsp;
Here, morning and evening, you will find the <i>Bheestees</i> of the
station congregated, some coming and some going, like bees at the mouth
of a hive, but most standing on the wall and letting down their leather
buckets into the water.&nbsp; As they begin to haul these up again hand
over hand, you will look to see them all topple head foremost into the
well, but they do not as a rule.&nbsp; It makes an imaginative European
giddy to look down into that Tartarean depth; but then the <i>Bheestee</i>
is not imaginative.&nbsp; As the hot season advances, the water retreats
further and further into the bowels of the earth, and the labour of
filling the <i>mussuk</i> becomes more and more arduous.&nbsp; At the
same time, the demand for water increases, for man is thirsty and the
ground parched.&nbsp; So the toils of the poor <i>Bheestee</i> march
<i>pari passu</i> with the tyranny of the climate, and he grows thin
and very black.&nbsp; Then, with the rain, his vacation begins.&nbsp;
Happy man if his master does not cut his pay down on the ground that
he has little to do.&nbsp; We masters sometimes do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I believe the <i>mussuk</i> bearer is the true and original <i>Bheestee</i>,
but in many places, as wealth and luxury have spread, he has emancipated
his own back and laid his burden on the patient bullock, which walks
sagaciously before him, and stops at the word of command beside each
flower-pot or bush.&nbsp; He treats his slave kindly, hanging little
bells and <i>cowries</i> about its neck.&nbsp; If it is refractory he
does not beat it, but gently reviles its female ancestors.&nbsp; I like
the <i>Bheestee</i> and respect him.&nbsp; As a man, he is temperate
and contented, eating <i>bajree</i> bread and slacking his thirst with
his own element.&nbsp; The author of Hobson Jobson says he never saw
a drunken <i>Bheestee</i>.&nbsp; And as a servant he is laborious and
faithful, rarely shirking his work, seeking it out rather.&nbsp; For
example, we had a bottle-shaped filter of porous stoneware, standing
in a bucket of water, which it was his duty to fill daily; but the good
man, not content with doing his bare duty, took the plug out of the
filter and filled it too!&nbsp; And all the station knows how assiduously
he fills the rain gauge.&nbsp; But what I like best in him is his love
of nature.&nbsp; He keeps a tame lark in a very small cage, covered
with dark cloth that it may sing, and early in the morning you will
find him in the fields, catching grasshoppers for his little pet.&nbsp;
I am speaking of a Mahomedan <i>Bheestee</i>.&nbsp; You must not expect
love of nature in a Hindoo.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>TOM, THE BARBER</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In India it is not good form to shave yourself.&nbsp; You ought to
respect the religious prejudices and social institutions of the people.&nbsp;
If everyone shaved himself, how would the Barber&rsquo;s stomach be
filled?&nbsp; The pious feeling which prompts this question lies deep
in the heart of Hindoo society.&nbsp; We do not understand it.&nbsp;
How can we, with our cold-blooded creed of demand and supply, free trade
and competition, fair field and no favour?&nbsp; In this ancient land,
whose social system is not a deformed growth, but a finished structure,
nothing has been left to chance, least of all a man&rsquo;s beard; for,
cleanliness and godliness not being neighbours here, a beard well matted
with ashes and grease is the outward and visible sign of sanctity.&nbsp;
And so, in the golden age, when men did everything that is wise and
right, there was established a caste whose office it was to remove that
sign from secular chins.&nbsp; How impious and revolutionary then must
it be for a man who is not a barber to tamper with his own beard, thus
taking the bread out of the mouths of barbers born, and blaspheming
the wisdom of the ancient founders of civilization!&nbsp; It is true
that, during the barbers&rsquo; strike a few years ago, the Brahmins,
even of orthodox Poona, consecrated a few of their own number to the
use of the razor.&nbsp; But desperate diseases demand desperate remedies.&nbsp;
When the barbers struck, Nature did not strike.&nbsp; Beards grew as
before, and threatened to change the whole face of society.&nbsp; In
view of such an appalling crisis who would say anything was unlawful?&nbsp;
Besides, British rule is surely undermining the very foundations of
society, and I doubt if you could find a Brahmin to-day under fifty
years of age whose heart is not more or less corroded by the spirit
of change.&nbsp; Your young University man is simply honey-combed: he
can scarcely conceal his mind from his own mother or wife.</p>
<p>But I must return to the Barber.&nbsp; The natives call him <i>hujjam</i>.&nbsp;
He has been bred so true for a score or so of centuries that shaving
must be an instinct with him now.&nbsp; His right hand is as delicate
an organ as a foxhound&rsquo;s nose.&nbsp; I believe that, when inebriated,
he goes on shaving, just as a toad deprived of its brain will walk and
eat and scratch its nose.&nbsp; If you put a jagged piece of tin into
the hand of a baby <i>hujjam</i>, he will scrape his little sister&rsquo;s
face with it.&nbsp; In India, as you know, every caste has its own &ldquo;points,&rdquo;
and you can distinguish a Barber as easily as a <i>dhobie</i> or a Dorking
hen.&nbsp; He is a sleek, fair-complexioned man, dressed in white, with
an ample red turban, somewhat oval in shape, like a sugared almond.&nbsp;
He wears large gold earrings in the upper part of his ears, and has
a sort of false stomach, which, at a distance, gives him an aldermanic
figure, but proves, on a nearer view, to be made of leather, and to
have many compartments, filled with razors, scissors, soap, brush, comb,
mirror, tweezers, earpicks, and other instruments of a more or less
surgical character; for he is, indeed, a surgeon, and especially an
aurist and narist.&nbsp; When he takes a Hindoo head into his charge,
he does not confine himself to the chin or scalp, but renovates it all
over.&nbsp; The happy patient enjoys the operation, sitting proudly
in a public place.&nbsp; When a Barber devotes himself to European heads
he rises in the social scale.&nbsp; If he has any real talent for his
profession, he soon rises to the rank and title of Tom, and may eventually
be presented with a small hot-water jug, bearing an inscription to the
effect that it is a token of the respect and esteem in which he was
held by the officers of the ---th Regiment at the station of Daree-nai-hona.&nbsp;
This is equivalent to a C. I. E., but is earned by merit.&nbsp; In truth,
Tom is a great institution.&nbsp; He opens the day along with tea and
hot toast and the <i>Daree-nai-hona Chronicle</i>, but we throw aside
the <i>Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; It is all very well if you want to know
which band will play at the band-stand this evening, and the leading
columns are occasionally excruciatingly good, when a literary corporal
of the Fusiliers discusses the political horizon, or unmasks the <i>Herald</i>,
pointing out with the most pungent sarcasm how &ldquo;our virtuous contemporary
puts his hands in his breeches pockets, like a crocodile, and sheds
tears;&rdquo; but during the parade season the corporal writes little,
and articles by the regular staff, upon the height to which cantonment
hedges should be allowed to grow, are apt to be dull.&nbsp; For news
we depend on Tom.&nbsp; He appears reticent at first, but be patient.&nbsp;
Let him put the soap on, and then tap him gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, what news this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No news, sar.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a long pause, &ldquo;Commissioner
Saheb coming to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&nbsp; No, he is not coming for three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow coming.&nbsp; Not telling anybody; quietly coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; After another pause, &ldquo;Nana Shett
give Mamletdar 500 rupee for not send his son to prison.&nbsp; Then
Nana Shett&rsquo;s brother he fight with Nana Shett, so he write letter
to Commissioner and tell him you come quietly and make inquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mamletdar has been taking bribes, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody taking.&nbsp; Fouzdar take 200 rupee.&nbsp; Dipooty
take 500 rupee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Does the Deputy Collector take bribes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows.&nbsp; Black man very bad.&nbsp; All black man same
like bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then are you not a black man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom smiles pleasantly and makes a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Saheb&rsquo;s madam got baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl, sar.&nbsp; Colonel Saheb very angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say, &lsquo;I want boy.&nbsp; Why always girl coming?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Get very angry.&nbsp; Beat butler with stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Tom is a great institution.&nbsp; Who can estimate how much
we owe to him for the circulation of that lively interest in one another&rsquo;s
well-being which characterises the little station?&nbsp; Tom comes,
like the Pundit, in the morning, but he is different from the Pundit
and we welcome him.&nbsp; He is not a shadow of the black examination-cloud
which lowers over us.&nbsp; There is no flavour of grammars and dictionaries
about him.&nbsp; Even if he finds you still in bed, conscience gets
no support from him.&nbsp; He does not awaken you, but slips in with
noiseless tread, lifts the mosquito curtains, proceeds with his duty
and departs, leaving no token but a gentle dream about the cat which
came and licked your cheeks and chin with its soft, warm tongue, and
scratched you playfully with its claws, while a cold frog, embracing
your nose, looked on and smiled a froggy smile.&nbsp; The barber&rsquo;s
hand <i>is</i> cold and clammy.&nbsp; <i>Chacun &agrave; son gout</i>.&nbsp;
I do not like him.&nbsp; I grow my beard, and Tom looks at me as the
Chaplain regards dissenters.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>OUR &ldquo;NOWKERS&rdquo;&mdash;THE MARCH PAST</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Now it is time to close our inspection and order a march past.&nbsp;
I think I have marshalled the whole force.&nbsp; It may seem a small
band to you, if you have lived in imperial Bengal, for we of Bombay
do not generally keep a special attendant to fill and light our pipe,
and our <i>tatoo</i> does not require a man to cut its grass.&nbsp;
Some of us even put on our own clothes.&nbsp; In short, we have not
carried the art of living to such oriental perfection as prevails on
the other side of India, and a man of simple tastes will find my company
of fourteen a sufficient staff.&nbsp; There they are, <i>Sub hazir hai</i>,
&ldquo;they are all present,&rdquo; the butler says, except one humble,
but necessary officer, who does not like to appear.&nbsp; He is known
familiarly by many names.&nbsp; You may call him Plantagenet, for his
emblem is the lowly broom; but since his modesty keeps him in the background,
we will leave him there.&nbsp; The rest are before you, the faithful
corps with whose help we transact our exile life.&nbsp; You may look
at them from many standpoints, and how much depends on which you take!&nbsp;
I suspect the commonest with us masters is that which regards boy, butler,
<i>mussaul</i>, cook, as just so many synonyms for channels by which
the hard-earned rupee, which is our life-blood, flows from us continually.&nbsp;
This view puts enmity between us and them, between our interests and
theirs.&nbsp; It does not come into our minds, that when we submit our
claim for an extra allowance of Rs. 200 under section 1735 of the Code,
and the <i>mussaul</i> gets the butler to prefer a humble request for
an increase of one rupee a month to his slender <i>puggar</i>, we and
the <i>mussaul</i> are made kin by that one touch of nature.&nbsp; We
spurn the request and urge the claim, with equal wonderment at the effrontery
of <i>mussauls</i> and the meanness of Governments.&nbsp; And &ldquo;the
angels weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shift your standpoint, and in each cringing menial you will see a
black token of that Asiatic metamorphosis through which we all have
passed.&nbsp; What a picture!&nbsp; Look at yourself as you stand there
in purple sublimity, trailing clouds of darkness from the middle ages
whence you come, planting your imperial foot on all the manly traditions
of your own free country, and pleased with the grovelling adulations
of your trembling serfs.&nbsp; And now it is not the angels who weep,
but the Baboo of Bengal.&nbsp; His pale and earnest brow is furrowed
with despair as he turns from you.&nbsp; For whither shall he turn?&nbsp;
When his bosom palpitates with the intense joy of newborn aspirations
for liberty, to whom shall he go if the Briton, the champion of the
world&rsquo;s freedom, has drunk of Comus&rsquo;s cup and become an
oriental satrap?&nbsp; Ah! there is still hope.&nbsp; The &ldquo;large
heart of England&rdquo; beats still for him.&nbsp; In the land of John
Hampden and Labouchere there are thousands yet untainted by the plague,
who keep no servant, who will listen to the Baboo while he tells them
about you, and perhaps return him to parliament.</p>
<p>There is a third view of the case, fraught with much content to those
who can take it, and, happily, it is the only view possible to the primitive
intelligences over which we exercise domestic lordship.&nbsp; In this
view they are, indeed, as we regard them&mdash;so many channels by which
the rupee may flow from us; but what are we, if not great reservoirs,
built to feed those very channels?&nbsp; And so, with that &ldquo;sweet
reasonableness&rdquo; which is so pleasant a feature of the Hindoo mind,
your boy or butler, being the main conduit, sets himself to estimate
the capacity of the reservoir, that he may adapt the gauge of each pipe
and regulate the flow.&nbsp; And, as the reservoir grows greater, as
the assistant becomes a collector and the collector a commissioner,
the pipes are extended and enlarged, and all rejoice together.&nbsp;
The moral beauty of this view of the situation grows upon you as you
accustom your mind to dwell on it.&nbsp; Is it not pleasant to think
of yourself as a beneficent irrigation work, watering a wide expanse
of green pasture and smiling corn, or as a well in a happy garden, diffusing
life and bloom?&nbsp; Look at the syce&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Phil
Robinson says there are nine of them, all about the same age and dressed
in the same nakedness.&nbsp; As they squat together there, indulging
&ldquo;the first and purest of our instincts&rdquo; in the mud or dust
of the narrow back road, reflect that their tender roots are nourished
by a thin rivulet of rupees which flows from you.&nbsp; If you dried
up, they would droop and perhaps die.&nbsp; The butler has a bright
little boy, who goes to school every day in a red velvet cap and print
jacket, with a small slate in his hand, and hopes one day to climb higher
in the word than his father.&nbsp; His tendrils are wrapped about your
salary.&nbsp; Nay, you may widen the range of your thoughts: the old
hut in the environs of Surat, with its patch of field and the giant
gourds, acknowledges you, and a small stream, diverted from one of the
channels which you supply, is filling a deep cistern in one of the back
streets of Goa.&nbsp; Pardon me if I think that the untutored Indian&rsquo;s
thought is better even for us than any which we have framed for ourselves.&nbsp;
Imagine yourself as a sportsman, spear in hand, pursuing the wild V.C.
through fire and water, or patiently stalking the wary K.C.B., or laying
snares for the gentle C.I.E.; or else as a humble industrious dormouse
lining a warm nest for the winter of your life in Bath or Tunbridge
Wells; or as a gay butterfly flitting from flower to flower while the
sunshine of your brief day may last; or simply as a prisoner toiling
at the treadmill because you must: the well in the garden is a pleasanter
conception than all these and wholesomer.&nbsp; Foster it while you
may.&nbsp; Now that India has wakened up and begun to spin after the
rest of the great world down the ringing grooves of change, these tints
of dawn will soon fade away, and in the light of noon the instructed
Aryan will learn to see and deplore the monstrous inequalities in the
distribution of wealth.&nbsp; He will come to understand the essential
equality of all men, and the real nature of the contract which subsists
between master and servant.&nbsp; Yes, I am afraid the day is fast drawing
near when you will no longer venture to cut the <i>hamal&rsquo;s</i>
pay for letting mosquitoes into your bed curtains and he will no longer
join his palms and call you his father and mother for doing so.&nbsp;
What a splendid capacity for obedience there is in this ancient people!&nbsp;
And our relations with them have certainly taught us again how to govern,
which is one of the forgotten arts in the West.&nbsp; Where in the world
to-day is there a land so governed as this Indian Empire?</p>
<p>And now each man wants his &ldquo;character&rdquo; before he makes
his last <i>salaam</i>, and what shall I say?&nbsp; &ldquo;The bearer
--- has been in my service since --- and I have always found him ---
&rdquo;&nbsp; So far good; but what next?&nbsp; Honest?&mdash;Yes.&nbsp;
Willing?&mdash;Certainly.&nbsp; Careful?&mdash;Very.&nbsp; Hardworking?&mdash;Well,
I have often told him that he was a lazy scoundrel, and that he might
easily take a lesson in activity from the <i>bheestee&rsquo;s</i> bullock,
and perhaps I spoke the truth.&nbsp; But, after all, he gets up in the
morning an hour before me, and eats his dinner after I have retired
for the night.&nbsp; He gets no Saturday half-holiday, and my Sabbath
is to him as the other days of the week.&nbsp; And so the hard things
I have said of him and to him are forgotten, and charity triumphs at
the last.&nbsp; And when my furlough is over and I return to these shores,
the whole troop will be at the Apollo Bunder, waiting to welcome back
their old master and eat his salt again.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT.&nbsp; THE GOWLEE, OR DOODWALLAH</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Gopal, the <i>Gowlee</i>, haunts me in my dreams, complaining that
he has been left out in the cold.&nbsp; I had classed him with the <i>borah</i>
and the baker, as outsiders with whom I had merely business relations;
but Gopal seems to urge that he is not on the same footing with these.&nbsp;
How can he be compared to a mercenary <i>borah</i>?&nbsp; Has he not
ministered to my wants, morning and evening, in wet weather and dry?&nbsp;
Have not my children grown up on his milk?&nbsp; He will not deny that
they have eaten the baker&rsquo;s bread too; but who is the baker?&nbsp;
Does he come into the <i>saheb&rsquo;s</i> presence in person as Gopal
does?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; He sits in his shop and sends a servant.&nbsp;
Not so Gopal.&nbsp; He is one of my children, and I am his father and
mother.&nbsp; And I am forced to admit there is some truth in this view
of the case.&nbsp; The ill-favoured man who haunts my house of a morning,
with a large basket of loaves poised slantwise on his head, and converses
in a strange nasal brogue with the cook, is not Mr. de Souza, &ldquo;baker
of superior first and second sort bread, and manufacturer of every kind
of biscuit, cake,&rdquo; &amp;c., but a mere underling.&nbsp; My intercourse
with the head of the firm is confined to the first day of each month,
when he waits on me in person, dressed in a smart black jacket, and
presents his bill.&nbsp; Also on Good Friday he sends me a cake and
his compliments, but the former, if it is not intercepted by the butler
and applied to his own uses, is generally too unctuous for my taste.&nbsp;
Very different are our relations with the <i>Doodwallah</i>.&nbsp; Our
<i>chota hazree</i> waits for him in the morning; our afternoon tea
cannot proceed till he comes; the baby cries if the <i>Doodwallah</i>
is late.&nbsp; And even if you are one of the few who strike for independence
and keep their own cow, I still counsel you to maintain amicable relations
with the <i>Doodwallah</i>.&nbsp; One day the cow will kick and refuse
to be milked, and the butler will come to you with a troubled countenance.&nbsp;
It is a grave case and demands professional skill.&nbsp; The <i>Doodwallah</i>
must be sent for to milk the cow.&nbsp; In many other ways, too, we
are made to feel our dependence on him.&nbsp; I believe we rarely die
of cholera, or typhoid fever, without his unobtrusive assistance.&nbsp;
And all his services are performed in person, not through any underling.&nbsp;
That stately man who walks up the garden path morning and evening, erect
as a betel-nut palm, with a tiara of graduated milk-pots on his head,
and driving a snorting buffalo before him, is Gopal himself.&nbsp; Scarcely
any other figure in the compound impresses me in the same way as his.&nbsp;
It is altogether Eastern in its simple dignity, and symbolically it
is eloquent.&nbsp; The buffalo represents absolute milk and the lessening
pyramid of brass <i>lotas</i>, from the great two-gallon vessel at the
base to the &frac14;-seer measure at the top, stand for successive degrees
of dilution with that pure element which runs in the roadside ditches
after rain.&nbsp; Thus his insignia interpret themselves to me.&nbsp;
Gopal does not acknowledge my heraldry, but explains that the lowest
<i>lota</i> contains butter milk&mdash;that is to say, milk for making
butter.&nbsp; The second contains milk which is excellent for drinking,
but will not yield butter; the third a cheaper quality of milk for puddings,
and so on.&nbsp; If you are an anxious mother, or a fastidious bachelor,
and none of these will please you, then he brings the buffalo to the
door and milks it in your presence.&nbsp; I think the truth which underlies
the two ways of putting the thing is the same: Gopal and I differ in
form of words only.&nbsp; However that may be, practice is more than
theory, and I stipulate for milk for all purposes from the lowest <i>lota</i>&mdash;that
is, milk which is warranted to yield butter.&nbsp; If it will not stand
that test, I reject it.&nbsp; Gopal wonders at my extravagance, but
consents.&nbsp; The milk is good and the butter from it plentiful.&nbsp;
But as time goes on the latter declines both in quantity and quality,
so gradually that suspicion is scarcely awakened.&nbsp; When at last
you summon the butler to a consultation, he suggests that the weather
has been too hot for successful butter making, or too cold.&nbsp; If
these reasons do not satisfy you, he has others; if they fail, he gives
his verdict against the <i>Doodwallah</i>.&nbsp; Next morning Gopal
is called to superintend the making of the butter and convicted, convicted
but not abashed.&nbsp; He expresses the greatest regret, but blames
the buffalo; its calf is too old.&nbsp; To-morrow you shall have the
produce of another buffalo.&nbsp; So next day you have the satisfaction
of seeing a fine healthy pat of butter swimming in the butter dish,
carved and curled with all the butler&rsquo;s art, like a full-blown
dahlia.&nbsp; But the milk in your tea does not improve, for Gopal,
after ascertaining how much milk you set aside for butter every day,
finds that the new buffalo yields only that quantity, and so what you
require for other purposes comes from another source.&nbsp; The butler
forgot to tell you this.&nbsp; What bond is there between him and honest
Gopal?&nbsp; I cannot tell.&nbsp; Many are the mysteries of housekeeping
in India, and puzzling its problems.&nbsp; If you could behead your
butler when anything went wrong, I have very little doubt everything
would go right, but the complicated methods of modern justice are no
match for the subtleties of Indian petty wickedness.&nbsp; And yet under
this crust of cunning there is a vein of simple stupidity which constantly
crops up where you least expect it.&nbsp; I remember a gentleman, a
bachelor, who set before himself a very high standard.&nbsp; He would
be strictly just and justly strict.&nbsp; He suspected that his milk
was watered, but his faithful boy protested that this could not be,
as the milking was begun and finished in his presence.&nbsp; So the
master provided himself with a lactometer, and the suspicion became
certainty.&nbsp; Summoning his boy into his presence, he explained to
him that that little instrument, which he saw floating in the so-called
milk before him, could neither lie nor be deceived.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
declares,&rdquo; he added sternly, &ldquo;that there is twenty-five
per cent. of water in this milk.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your lordship speaks
the truth,&rdquo; answered the faithful man, &ldquo;but how could I
tell a lie?&nbsp; The milk was drawn in my presence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you mean to say you were there the whole time the animal was being milked?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The whole time, your lordship.&nbsp; Would I give those rogues
the chance of watering the <i>saheb&rsquo;s</i> milk?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
master thought for a moment, and asked again, &ldquo;Are you sure there
was no water in the pail before the milking began?&mdash;these people
are very cunning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are as cunning as <i>sheitan</i>,
your lordship, but I made the man turn the pail upside down and shake
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again the master turned the matter over in his just
mind, and it occurred to him that the lactometer was of English manufacture
and might be puzzled by the milk of the buffalo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this
cow&rsquo;s milk, or buffalo&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; The boy
was beginning to feel his position uncomfortable and caught at this
chance of escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! that I cannot tell.&nbsp; It may
be buffalo&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Tableau.</i></p>
<p>I have spoken of having butter made in the house, but Gopal carries
on all departments of a dairyman&rsquo;s business, and you may buy butter
of him at two annas a &ldquo;cope.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let philologists settle
the derivation of the word.&nbsp; The &ldquo;cope&rdquo; is a measure
like a small tea-cup, and when Gopal has filled it, he presses the butter
well down with his hand, so that a man skilled in palmistry may read
the honest milkman&rsquo;s fortune off any cope of his butter.&nbsp;
How he makes it, or of what materials, I dare not say.&nbsp; Many flavours
mingle in it, some familiar enough, some unknown to me.&nbsp; Its texture
varies too.&nbsp; Sometimes it is pasty, sometimes semi-fluid, sometimes
sticky, following the knife.&nbsp; In colour it is bluish-white, unless
dyed.&nbsp; All things considered, I refuse Gopal&rsquo;s butter, and
have mine made at home.&nbsp; The process is very simple, and no churn
is needed.&nbsp; Every morning the milk for next day&rsquo;s butter
is put into a large flat dish, to stand for twenty-four hours, at the
end of which time, if the dish is as dirty as it should be, the milk
has curdled.&nbsp; Then, with a tin spoon, Mukkun skims off the cream
and puts it into a large pickle bottle, and squatting on the ground,
<i>more suo</i>, bumps the bottle upon a pad until the butter is made.&nbsp;
The artistic work of preparing it for presentation remains.&nbsp; First
it is dyed yellow with a certain seed, that it may please the <i>saheb&rsquo;s</i>
taste, for buffalo butter is quite white, and you know it is an axiom
in India that cow&rsquo;s milk does not yield butter.&nbsp; Then Mukkun
takes a little bamboo instrument and patiently works the butter into
a &ldquo;flower&rdquo; and sends it to breakfast floating in cold water.</p>
<p>Gopal is a man of substance, owning many buffaloes and immensely
fat Guzerat cows, with prodigious humps and large pendent ears.&nbsp;
His family, having been connected for many generations with the sacred
animal, he enjoys a certain consciousness of moral respectability, like
a man whose uncles are deans or canons.&nbsp; In my mind, he is always
associated rather with his buffaloes, those great, unwieldy, hairless,
slate-coloured docile, intelligent antediluvians.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>THE MISCELLANEOUS WALLAHS</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I have yielded to the claim of the <i>doodwallah</i> to be reckoned
among the <i>nowkers</i>.&nbsp; His right is more than doubtful, and
I will yield no further.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is a cluster of petty
dependents, a nebula of minor satellites, which have us for the focus
of their orbit, and which cannot be left out of a comprehensive account
of our system.&nbsp; Whence, for example, is that raucus stridulation
which sets every tooth on edge and sends a rheumatic shiver up my spine?&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is only the <i>Kalai-wallah</i>,&rdquo; says the boy, and
points to a muscular black man, very nearly in the garb of a Grecian
athlete, standing with both feet in one of my largest cooking pots.&nbsp;
He grasps a post with both hands, and swings his whole frame fiercely
from side to side with a circular motion, like the balance wheel of
a watch.&nbsp; He seems to have a rough cloth and sand under his feet,
so I suppose this is only his energetic way of scouring the pot preparatory
to tinning it, for the <i>Kalai-wallah</i> is the &ldquo;tin-man,&rdquo;
whose beneficent office it is to avert death by verdigris and salts
of copper from you and your family.&nbsp; His assistant, a semi-nude,
fleshless youth, has already extemporized a furnace of clay in the ground
hard by, and is working a huge pair of clumsy bellows.&nbsp; Around
him are all manner of copper kitchen utensils, <i>handies</i>, or <i>deckshies</i>,
kettles, frying-pans, and what not, and there are also on the ground
some rings of <i>kalai</i>, commonly called tin; but pure tin is an
expensive metal, and I do not think it is any part of the <i>Kalai-wallah&rsquo;s</i>
care to see that you are not poisoned with lead.&nbsp; One notable peculiarity
there is in this <i>Kalai-wallah</i>, or tin-man, which deserves record,
namely, that he pays no <i>dustooree</i> to any man.&nbsp; I take it
as sufficient evidence of this fact that, though even the <i>matie</i>
could tell you that the pots ought to be tinned once a month, neither
the butler nor the cook ever seems to remember when the day comes round.&nbsp;
This is a matter which you must see to personally.&nbsp; Contrast with
this the case of the <i>Nalbund</i>, the clink of whose hammer in the
early morning tells that the 15th of the month has dawned.&nbsp; His
portable anvil is already in the ground, and he is hammering the shoes
into shape after a fashion; but he is not very particular about this,
for if the shoe does not fit the hoof he can always cut the hoof to
fit the shoe.&nbsp; This is an advantage which the maker of shoes for
human feet does not enjoy, though I have heard of very fashionable ladies
who secretly have one toe amputated that the rest may more easily be
squeezed into that curious pointed thing, which, by some mysterious
process of mind, is regarded as an elegant shoe.&nbsp; But this is by
the way.&nbsp; To return to the <i>Nalbund</i>.&nbsp; His work is guaranteed
to last one calendar month, and your faithful <i>ghorawallah</i>, who
remembers nothing else, and scarcely knows the day of the week, bears
in mind the exact date on which the horse has to be shod next, and if
the careless <i>Nalbund</i> does not appear, promptly goes in search
of him.&nbsp; Does not this speak volumes for the efficiency of that
venerable and wonderful institution <i>dustooree</i>, by which the interests
of all classes are cemented together and the wheels of the social system
are oiled?&nbsp; The shoeing of the bullock is generally a distinct
profession, I believe, from the shoeing of the horse, and is not considered
such a high art.&nbsp; The poor <i>byle</i> is thrown, and, his feet
being tied together, the assistant holds his nose to the ground, while
the master nails a small slip of bad iron to each half of the hoof.&nbsp;
I often stop on my way to contemplate this spectacle, which beautifully
illustrates that cold patience, or natural thick-skinnedness, which
fits the <i>byle</i> so admirably for his lot in this land.&nbsp; He
is yoked to a creaking cart and prodded with a sharp nail to make him
go, his female ancestry reviled to the third generation, his belly tickled
with the driver&rsquo;s toes, and his tail twisted till the joints crack,
but he plods patiently on till he feels disposed to stop, and then he
lies down and takes with an even mind such cudgelling as the enraged
driver can inflict.&nbsp; At last a fire of straw is lighted under him,
and then he gets up and goes on.&nbsp; He never grows restive or frets,
as a horse would, and so he does not wear out.&nbsp; This is the reason
why bullocks are used throughout India for all agricultural purposes.&nbsp;
The horse does not suit the genius of the people.&nbsp; I wish horses
in India could do without shoes.&nbsp; In sandy districts, like Guzerat,
they can, and are much better unshod; but in the stony Deccan some protection
is absolutely necessary, and the poor beast is often at the mercy of
the village bullock <i>Nalbund</i>.&nbsp; It carries my thoughts to
the days of our forefathers, when the blacksmith was also the dentist.</p>
<p>The <i>Nalbund</i> leads naturally to the <i>Ghasswallah</i>, or
grass-man, whose sign is a mountain of green stuff, which comes nodding
in at the back gate every day upon four emaciated legs.&nbsp; A small
pony&rsquo;s nose protrudes from the front, with a muzzle on, for in
such matters the spirit of the law of Moses is not current in this country.&nbsp;
The mild Hindoo does muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn.&nbsp; His religion forbids him to take life, and he obeys, but
he steers as near to that sin as he can, without actually committing
it, and vitality is seen here at a lower ebb, perhaps, than in any other
country under the sun.&nbsp; The grassman maintains just so much flesh
on the bones of his beast as will suffice to hold them together under
their burden, and this can be done without lucerne grass, so poor Tantalus
toddles about, buried under a pile of sweet-scented, fresh, green herbage,
ministering to the sleek aristocracy of his own kind, and returns to
gnaw his daily allowance of <i>kurbee</i>.&nbsp; There is, however,
one alleviation of his lot for which he may well be thankful, and that
is that his burden so encompasses him about that the stick of his driver
cannot get at any part of him.&nbsp; I believe the <i>Ghasswallah</i>
is an institution peculiar to our presidency&mdash;this kind of <i>Ghasswallah</i>,
I mean, who is properly a farmer, owning large well-irrigated fields
of lucerne grass.&nbsp; Hay is supplied by another kind of <i>Ghasswallah</i>,
who does not keep a pony, but brings the daily allowance on his head.&nbsp;
That allowance is five <i>polees</i> for each horse.&nbsp; A <i>polee</i>
is a bundle of grass about as thick as a tree, and as long as a bit
of string.&nbsp; This hay merchant does a large business, and used to
send in a monthly bill to each of his constituents in due form, thus:-</p>

<p>The &frac12; horse was a cow.</p>
<p>As the monsoon draws to a close and the weather begins to get colder,
a man in a tight brown suit and leather belt, with an unmistakable flavour
of sport about him, presents himself at the door.&nbsp; This is the
<i>shikaree</i> come with <i>khubber</i> of &ldquo;<i>ishnap</i>,&rdquo;
and quail, and duck, and in fact of anything you like up to bison and
tiger.&nbsp; But we must dismiss him to-day.&nbsp; He would require
a chapter to himself, and would take me over ground quite outside of
my present scope.&nbsp; What a <i>loocha</i> he is!</p>
<p>What shall I say of the <i>Roteewallah</i> and the <i>Jooteewallah</i>,
who comes round so regularly to keep your boots and shoes in disrepair,
and of all the vociferous tribe of <i>borahs</i>?&nbsp; There is the
<i>Kupprawallah</i>, and the <i>Boxwallah</i>, and the <i>Ready-made-clotheswallah</i>
(&ldquo;readee made cloes mem sa-ab! dressin&rsquo; gown, badee, petticoat,
drars, chamees, everyting, mem sa-ab, very che-eap!&rdquo;) and the
<i>Chowchowwallah</i> and the <i>Maiwawallah</i> or fruit man, with
his pleasant basket of pomeloes and oranges, plantains, red and white,
custard apples, guavas, figs, grapes, and pineapples, and those suspicious-looking
old iron scales, hanging by greasy, knotted strings.&nbsp; Each of these
good people, it seems, lives in this hard world for no other end but
to supply my wants.&nbsp; One of them is positive that he supplied my
father with the necessaries of life before I was born.&nbsp; He is by
appearance about eighteen years of age, but this presents no difficulty,
for if it was not he who ministered to my parent, it was his father,
and so he has not only a personal, but a hereditary claim on me.&nbsp;
He is a <i>workboxwallah</i>, and is yearning to show his regard for
me by presenting me with a lady&rsquo;s sandalwood dressing-case in
return for the trifling sum of thirty-five rupees.&nbsp; The <i>sindworkwallah</i>,
who has a similar esteem for me, scorns the thought of wishing to sell,
but if I would just look at some of his beautiful things, he could go
away happy.&nbsp; When they are all spread upon the ground, then it
occurs to him that I have it in my power to make him lucky for the day
by buying a fancy smoking-cap, which, by-the-by, he brought expressly
for me.&nbsp; But this subject always makes me sad, for there is no
disguising the fact that the <i>borah</i> is fast passing away for ever,
and with him all the glowing morning tints of that life which we used
to live when India was still India.&nbsp; But let that regret pass.&nbsp;
One <i>wallah</i> remains, who presents himself at your door, not monthly,
or weekly, but every day, and often twice a day, and not at the back
verandah, but at the front, walking confidently up to the very easy-chair
on which we stretch our lordly limbs.&nbsp; And I may safely say that,
of all who claim directly or indirectly to have eaten our salt, there
is not a man for whom we have, one and all of us, a kindlier feeling.&nbsp;
You may argue that he is only a public servant, and has really far less
claim on us than any of the others; never mind -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I pray thee, peace.&nbsp; I will be flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The English mail is in, and we feel, and will feel, towards that
red-livened man as Noah felt towards the dove with the olive branch
in her mouth.&nbsp; And when Christmas comes round, howsoever we may
harden ourselves against others, scarcely one of us, I know, will grudge
a rupee to the <i>tapalwallah.</i></p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
