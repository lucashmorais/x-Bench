<dt>Beloved

the kisses of his mouth;
<dd>for your love is better than wine.
<dt> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Your oils have a
pleasing fragrance.
<dd>Your name is oil poured forth,
<dd>therefore the virgins love you.
<dt> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Take me away with you.
<dd>Let us hurry.
<dd>The king has brought me into his chambers.
<dt>
<dt>Friends
<dt>We will be glad and rejoice in you.
<dd>We will praise your love more than wine!
<dt>
<dt>Beloved
<dt>They are right to love you.
<dt> <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> I am dark, but lovely,
<dd>you daughters of Jerusalem,
<dd>like Kedar's tents,
<dd>like Solomon's curtains.
<dt> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Don't stare at me
because I am dark,
<dd>because the sun has scorched me.
<dt>My mother's sons were angry with me.
<dd>They made me keeper of the vineyards.
<dd>I haven't kept my own vineyard.
<dt> <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Tell me, you whom my
soul loves,
<dd>where you graze your flock,
<dd>where you rest them at noon;
<dd>For why should I be as one who is veiled
<dd>beside the flocks of your companions?
<dt>
<dt>Lover
<dt> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> If you don't know,
most beautiful among women,

<dt>
<dt> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> I have compared you,
my love,
<dd>to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.

beautiful with earrings,

earrings of gold,

his table,

sachet of myrrh,
<dd>that lies between my breasts.

cluster of henna blossoms

<dt>
<dt>Beloved
<dt> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> As the apple tree
among the trees of the wood,

<dt>I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
<dd>his fruit was sweet to my taste.
<dt> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> He brought me to the
banquet hall.
<dd>His banner over me is love.

raisins,
<dd>refresh me with apples;

my head.

daughters of Jerusalem,

<dd>until it so desires.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> The voice of my
beloved!
<dd>Behold, he comes,

<dt> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> My beloved is like a
roe or a young hart.
<dd>Behold, he stands behind our wall!
<dt>He looks in at the windows.
<dd>He glances through the lattice.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> My beloved spoke, and
said to me,

winter is past.
<dd>The rain is over and gone.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> The flowers appear on
the earth.
<dd>The time of the singing has come,
<dd>and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> The fig tree ripens
her green figs.
<dd>The vines are in blossom.
<dd>They give forth their fragrance.
<dt>Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
<dd>and come away.&quot;
<dt>

<dd>Let me hear your voice;
<dd>for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Catch for us the
foxes,

<dt>
<dt>Beloved
<dt> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> My beloved is mine,
and I am his.
<dd>He browses among the lilies.
<dt> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Until the day is
cool, and the shadows flee away,
<dd>turn, my beloved,
<dd>and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> By night on my bed,
<dd>I sought him whom my soul loves.
<dd>I sought him, but I didn't find him.
<dt> <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> I will get up now, and
go about the city;
<dd>in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.
<dd>I sought him, but I didn't find him.
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> The watchmen who go
about the city found me;
<dd>&quot;Have you seen him whom my soul loves?&quot;
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> I had scarcely passed
from them,
<dd>when I found him whom my soul loves.
<dt>I held him, and would not let him go,
<dd>until I had brought him into my mother's house,
<dd>into the chamber of her who conceived me.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> I adjure you,
daughters of Jerusalem,

<dd>that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
<dd>until it so desires.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Who is this who comes
up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
<dd>perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
<dd>with all spices of the merchant?
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Behold, it is
Solomon's carriage!
<dd>Sixty mighty men are around it,
<dd>of the mighty men of Israel.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> They all handle the
sword, and are expert in war.
<dd>Every man has his sword on his thigh,
<dd>because of fear in the night.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> King Solomon made
himself a carriage
<dd>of the wood of Lebanon.
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> He made its pillars
of silver,

<dt>
<dt> <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> I am my beloved's.
<dd>His desire is toward me.
<dt> <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Come, my beloved, let
us go forth into the field.
<dd>Let us lodge in the villages.
<dt> <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Let's go early up to
the vineyards.
<dd>Let's see whether the vine has budded,
<dd>its blossom is open,
<dd>and the pomegranates are in flower.
<dd>There I will give you my love.
<dt> <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> The mandrakes give
forth fragrance.
<dd>At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,
<dd>which I have stored up for you, my beloved.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Oh that you were like
my brother,
<dd>who sucked the breasts of my mother!
<dt>If I found you outside, I would kiss you;
<dd>yes, and no one would despise me.
<dt> <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> I would lead you,
bringing you into my mother's house,
<dd>who would instruct me.
<dt>I would have you drink spiced wine,
<dd>of the juice of my pomegranate.
<dt> <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> His left hand would be
under my head.
<dd>His right hand would embrace me.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> I adjure you,
daughters of Jerusalem,
<dd>that you not stir up, nor awaken love,

<dt>Friends
<dt> <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> Who is this who comes
up from the wilderness,

<dt>
<dt>Under the apple tree I aroused you.
<dd>There your mother conceived you.
<dd>There she was in labor and bore you.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> Set me as a seal on
your heart,
<dd>as a seal on your arm;
<dd>for love is strong as death.
<dd>Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
<dd>Its flashes are flashes of fire,
<dd>a very flame of Yahweh.
<dt> <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Many waters can't
quench love,
<dd>neither can floods drown it.
<dt>If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
<dd>he would be utterly scorned.

<dt>Friends

<dt>Beloved
<dt> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> I am a wall, and my

<p>This file should be named web2210h.htm or web2210h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web2211h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web2210ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>

that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
