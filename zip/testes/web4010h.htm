The Good News According to Matthew
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The book of the genealogy
of Jesus <a href="#N1">Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Abraham became the father
of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of
Judah and his brothers.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Judah became the father of Perez
and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the
father of Ram.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> Ram became
the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon
became the father of Salmon.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> Salmon became the father of Boaz
by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father
of Jesse.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Jesse became the
father of David the king. David became the father of Solomon by her who
had been the wife of Uriah.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Solomon became the father of
Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father
of Asa.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Asa became the
father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram
became the father of Uzziah.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Uzziah became the father of
Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of
Hezekiah.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Hezekiah became
the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became
the father of Josiah.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Josiah became the father of
Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> After the exile to Babylon,
Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of
Zerubbabel.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Zerubbabel
became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim
became the father of Azor.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Azor became the father of Sadoc.
Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
 <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> Eliud became the father
of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the
father of Jacob.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> Jacob
became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born <a
href="#N2">Jesus</a>, who is called Christ.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> So all the generations from
Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the
Christ, fourteen generations.
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Now the birth of Jesus
Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph,
before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
 <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> Joseph, her husband,
being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example,
intended to put her away secretly.  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> But when he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,
&quot;Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your
wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> She shall bring forth a son. You
shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from
their sins.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Now all this has
happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through
the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> &quot;Behold, the
virgin shall be with child,
<dd>and shall bring forth a son.
<dt>They shall call his name Immanuel;&quot;
<dd>which is, being interpreted, &quot;God with us.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> Joseph arose from his
sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife
to himself;  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> and didn't
know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named
him Jesus.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Now when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, <a
href="#N4">wise men</a> from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> &quot;Where is he who is born King
of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship
him.&quot;  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> When Herod the
king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Gathering together all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be
born.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet, 
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> 'You Bethlehem, land
of Judah,
<dd>are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
<dt>for out of you shall come forth a governor,
<dd>who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Then Herod secretly
called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star
appeared.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> He sent them to
Bethlehem, and said, &quot;Go and search diligently for the young child.
When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and
worship him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> They, having heard the
king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east,
went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> They came into the house and saw
the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped
him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold,
frankincense, and myrrh.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.
<p> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Now when they had
departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
saying, &quot;Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into
Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young
child to destroy him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> He arose and took the
young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> and was there until the death of
Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, &quot;Out of Egypt I called my son.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> Then Herod, when he
saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent
out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the
surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the
exact time which he had learned from the wise men.  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Then that which was spoken by
Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> &quot;A voice was
heard in Ramah,
<dd>lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
<dt>Rachel weeping for her children;
<dd>she wouldn't be comforted,
<dd>because they are no more.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> But when Herod was
dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying,  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> &quot;Arise and
take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for
those who sought the young child's life are dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> He arose and took the
young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid
to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee,  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> and came and
lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through the prophets: &quot;He will be called a Nazarene.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> In those days, John the
Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> &quot;Repent, for the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand!&quot;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> For this is he who was spoken of
by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>make ready the way of the Lord.
<dd>Make his paths straight.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Now John himself wore
clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His
food was locusts and wild honey.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Then people from Jerusalem, all of
Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> They were <a
href="#N9">baptized</a> by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
 <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> But when he saw many of
the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his <a href="#N10">baptism,</a> he
said to them, &quot;You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from
the wrath to come?  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Therefore bring forth fruit worthy
of repentance!  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Don't think
to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God
is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
<p> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> &quot;Even now the axe
lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring
forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> I indeed <a
href="#N11">baptize</a> you in water for repentance, but he who comes
after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will
baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> His winnowing fork is in his
hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather
his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable
fire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Then Jesus came from
Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But John would have hindered him,
saying, &quot;I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> But Jesus, answering,
said to him, &quot;Allow it now, for this is the fitting
way for us to fulfill all righteousness.&quot; Then he allowed him.
 <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Jesus, when he was
baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were
opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming
on him.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Behold, a voice
out of the heavens said, &quot;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Then Jesus was led up
by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> When he had fasted forty days and
forty nights, he was hungry afterward.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> The tempter came and said to him,
&quot;If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become
bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> But he answered, &quot;It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Then the devil took him
into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> and said to him, &quot;If you are
the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his
angels in charge of you.' and,
<dl>
<dt>'On their hands they will bear you up,
<dd>so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N14">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Lord,
your God.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> Again, the devil took
him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of
the world, and their glory.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> He said to him, &quot;I will give
you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> Then Jesus said to
him, &quot;<a href="#N16">Get behind me,</a> Satan! For it
is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him
only.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Then the devil left
him, and behold, angels came and served him.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Now when Jesus heard that John
was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Leaving Nazareth, he came and
lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali,  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> &quot;The land of
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
<dd>toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
<dd>Galilee of the Gentiles,
<dt> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> the people who sat in
darkness saw a great light,
<dd>to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
<dd>to them light has dawned.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N18">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> From that time, Jesus
began to preach, and to say, &quot;Repent! For the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Walking by the sea of
Galilee, <a href="#N19">he</a> saw two brothers: Simon, who is called
Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were
fishermen.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> He said to
them, &quot;Come after me, and I will make you fishers for
men.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> They immediately left
their nets and followed him.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Going on from there, he saw two
other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
 <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> They immediately left the
boat and their father, and followed him.
<p> <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> Jesus went about in
all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the
Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
 <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> The report about him went
out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with
various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and
paralytics; and he healed them.  <a name="C4V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:25</font></a> Great multitudes from Galilee,
Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> Seeing the multitudes,
he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to
him.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> He opened his mouth
and taught them, saying,

<p> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> &quot;Blessed are you when people
reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you
falsely, for my sake.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad,
for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the
prophets who were before you.
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> &quot;You are the salt of the
earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted?
It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet
of men.  <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> You are the light
of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.  <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> Neither do you light a lamp, and
put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who
are in the house.  <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> Even
so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
<p> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> &quot;Don't think that I came to
destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.

tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one <a

shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are
accomplished.  <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> Whoever,
therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others
to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever
shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
 <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> For I tell you that
unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there
is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> &quot;You have heard that it was
said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N25">*</a></sup></font> and 'Whoever shall murder
shall be in danger of the judgment.'  <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> But I tell you, that everyone who
is angry with his brother <a href="#N26">without a cause</a> shall be in
danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, '<a
href="#N27">Raca</a>!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever
shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of <a
href="#N28">Gehenna.</a>
<p>  <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> &quot;If therefore you are
offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has
anything against you,  <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> leave your gift there before the
altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come
and offer your gift.  <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> Agree with your adversary
quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor
deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and
you be cast into prison.  <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, you
shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last <a
href="#N29">penny.</a>
<p> <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> &quot;You have heard that it was
said, <font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N30">*</a></sup></font>
'You shall not commit adultery;'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N31">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:28</font></a> but I tell you that everyone who
gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already
in his heart.  <a name="C5V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:29</font></a> If your
right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you.
For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish,
than for your whole body to be cast into <a href="#N32">Gehenna.</a>
 <a name="C5V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:30</font></a> If your right hand causes
you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more
profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your
whole body to be cast into <a href="#N33">Gehenna.</a>
<p> <a name="C5V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:31</font></a> &quot;It was also said, 'Whoever
shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N34">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:32</font></a> but I tell you that whoever puts
away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an
adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
<p> <a name="C5V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:33</font></a> &quot;Again you have heard that
it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall
perform to the Lord your vows,'  <a name="C5V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:34</font></a> but I tell you, don't swear at
all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;  <a name="C5V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:35</font></a> nor by the earth, for it is the
footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great
King.  <a name="C5V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:36</font></a> Neither shall you
swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.  <a name="C5V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:37</font></a> But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and
your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
<p> <a name="C5V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:38</font></a> &quot;You have heard that it was
said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N35">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:39</font></a> But I tell you, don't resist him
who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the
other also.  <a name="C5V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:40</font></a> If anyone
sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.  <a name="C5V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:41</font></a> Whoever compels you to go one
mile, go with him two.  <a name="C5V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:42</font></a> Give to him who asks you, and
don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you.
<p> <a name="C5V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:43</font></a> &quot;You have heard that it was
said, 'You shall love your neighbor,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N36">*</a></sup></font> and hate your enemy.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N37">*</a></sup></font>'  <a name="C5V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:44</font></a> But I tell you, love your
enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and
pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,  <a name="C5V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:45</font></a> that you may be children of your
Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the
good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.  <a name="C5V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:46</font></a> For if you love those who love
you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
 <a name="C5V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:47</font></a> If you only greet your
friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do
the same?  <a name="C5V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:48</font></a> Therefore you
shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> &quot;Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before
men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who
is in heaven.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Therefore
when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet before yourself, as the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get
glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their
reward.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> But when you do
merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand does,
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> so that your merciful
deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward
you openly.
<p> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> &quot;When you pray, you shall not
be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues
and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most
certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.  <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> But you, when you pray, enter into
your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is
in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
 <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> In praying, don't use vain
repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard
for their much speaking.  <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> Therefore don't be like them, for
your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> Pray like this: 'Our Father in
heaven, may your name be kept holy.  <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Let your Kingdom come. Let your
will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> Give us today our daily bread.
 <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Forgive us our debts, as
we also forgive our debtors.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> Bring us not into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil one. <a href="#N38">For yours is the Kingdom, the
power, and the glory forever. Amen.</a>'
<p> <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> &quot;For if you forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> But if you don't forgive men
their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
<p> <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> &quot;Moreover when you fast,
don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their
faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell
you, they have received their reward.  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> But you, when you fast, anoint
your head, and wash your face;  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> so that you are not seen by men
to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who
sees in secret, will reward you.
<p> <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> &quot;Don't lay up treasures for
yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves
break through and steal;  <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where
thieves don't break through and steal;  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> for where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.
<p> <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> &quot;The lamp of the body is the
eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of
light.  <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> But if your eye is
evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light
that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
<p> <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> &quot;No one can serve two
masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he
will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and
Mammon.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> Therefore, I tell
you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will
drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than
food, and the body more than clothing?  <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> See the birds of the sky, that
they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly
Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?
<p> <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> &quot;Which of you, by being
anxious, can add one <a href="#N39">moment</a> to his lifespan?  <a name="C6V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:28</font></a> Why are you anxious about
clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't
toil, neither do they spin,  <a name="C6V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:29</font></a> yet I tell you that even Solomon
in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.  <a name="C6V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:30</font></a> But if God so clothes the grass
of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
<p> <a name="C6V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:31</font></a> &quot;Therefore don't be anxious,
saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we
be clothed?'  <a name="C6V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:32</font></a> For the
Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that
you need all these things.  <a name="C6V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:33</font></a> But seek first God's Kingdom, and
his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
 <a name="C6V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:34</font></a> Therefore don't be
anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's
own evil is sufficient.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> &quot;Don't judge, so that you
won't be judged.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> For with
whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure
you measure, it will be measured to you.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> Why do you see the speck that is
in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own
eye?  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> Or how will you tell
your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the
beam is in your own eye?  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> You hypocrite! First remove the
beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck
out of your brother's eye.
<p> <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> &quot;Don't give that which is
holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps
they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
<p> <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> &quot;Ask, and it will be given
you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.
 <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> For everyone who asks
receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> Or who is there among you, who, if
his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?  <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Or if he asks for a fish, who
will give him a serpent?  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> If you then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is
in heaven give good things to those who ask him!  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Therefore whatever you desire for
men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the
prophets.
<p> <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> &quot;Enter in by the narrow
gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction,
and many are those who enter in by it.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> <a href="#N40">How</a> narrow is
the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who
find it.
<p> <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> &quot;Beware of false prophets,
who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
 <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> By their fruits you will
know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
 <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> Even so, every good tree
produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> A good tree can't produce evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Every tree that doesn't grow good
fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Therefore, by their fruits you
will know them.  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> Not
everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> Many will tell me in that day,
'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out
demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> Then I will tell them, 'I never
knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'
<p> <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> &quot;Everyone therefore who
hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man,
who built his house on a rock.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> The rain came down, the floods
came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for
it was founded on the rock.  <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> Everyone who hears these words of
mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house
on the sand.  <a name="C7V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:27</font></a> The rain
came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house;
and it fell--and great was its fall.&quot;
<p> <a name="C7V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:28</font></a> It happened, when
Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were
astonished at his teaching,  <a name="C7V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:29</font></a> for he taught them with
authority, and not like the scribes.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> When he came down from
the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> Behold, a leper came to him and
worshiped him, saying, &quot;Lord, if you want to, you can make me
clean.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> Jesus stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, &quot;I want to. Be made
clean.&quot; Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> Jesus said to him, &quot;See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the
priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to
them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> When he came into
Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> and saying, &quot;Lord, my servant
lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;I will come and heal him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> The centurion answered,
&quot;Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the
word, and my servant will be healed.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> For I am also a man under
authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he
goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> When Jesus heard it,
he marveled, and said to those who followed, &quot;Most
certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in
Israel.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> I tell you that
many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> but the children of the Kingdom
will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.&quot;  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> Jesus said to the centurion,
&quot;Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have
believed.&quot; His servant was healed in that hour.
<p> <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> When Jesus came into
Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> He touched her hand, and the
fever left her. She got up and served <a href="#N41">him.</a>  <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> When evening came, they brought
to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick;  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: &quot;He took our
infirmities, and bore our diseases.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Now when Jesus saw great
multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
<p> <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> A scribe came, and
said to him, &quot;Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> Another of his
disciples said to him, &quot;Lord, allow me first to go and bury my
father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> But Jesus said to him,
&quot;Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own
dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> When he got into a
boat, his disciples followed him.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> Behold, a violent storm came up
on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was
asleep.  <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> They came to him,
and woke him up, saying, &quot;Save us, Lord! We are dying!&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?&quot;
Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
<p> <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> The men marveled,
saying, &quot;What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea
obey him?&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> When he came to the
other side, into the country of the <a href="#N43">Gergesenes,</a> two
people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> Behold, they cried out, saying,
&quot;What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come
here to torment us before the time?&quot;  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Now there was a herd of many pigs
feeding far away from them.  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> The demons begged him, saying,
&quot;If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.&quot;
<p> <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Go!&quot;
<p>They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole
herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
 <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> Those who fed them fled,
and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened
to those who were possessed with demons.  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> Behold, all the city came out to
meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their
borders.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> He entered into a boat,
and crossed over, and came into his own city.  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> Behold, they brought to him a man
who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, &quot;Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> Behold, some of the
scribes said to themselves, &quot;This man blasphemes.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said, &quot;Why do you think evil in your
hearts?  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> For which is
easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'
 <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> But that you may know that
the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...&quot;
(then he said to the paralytic), &quot;Get up, and take up
your mat, and go up to your house.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> He arose and departed
to his house.  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> But when the
multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.
<p> <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> As Jesus passed by from
there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.
He said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot; He got up
and followed him.  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> It
happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners
came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> When the Pharisees saw it, they
said to his disciples, &quot;Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors
and sinners?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, &quot;Those who are healthy have no need
for a physician, but those who are sick do.  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> But you go and learn what this
means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font> for I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners <a href="#N45">to repentance.</a>&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> Then John's disciples
came to him, saying, &quot;Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but
your disciples don't fast?&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as
the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom
will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> No one puts a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment,
and a worse hole is made.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> Neither do people put new wine
into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be
spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins,
and both are preserved.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> While he told these
things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, &quot;My
daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will
live.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> Jesus got up and
followed him, as did his disciples.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> Behold, a woman who had an issue
of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the <a
href="#N46">fringe</a> of his garment;  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> for she said within herself,
&quot;If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> But Jesus, turning
around and seeing her, said, &quot;Daughter, cheer up!
Your faith has made you well.&quot; And the woman was made well
from that hour.
<p> <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> When Jesus came into
the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy
disorder,  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> he said to
them, &quot;Make room, because the girl isn't dead, but
sleeping.&quot;
<p>They were ridiculing him.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> But when the crowd was put out,
he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> The report of this went out into
all that land.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> As Jesus
passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying,
&quot;Have mercy on us, son of David!&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:28</font></a> When he had come into
the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, &quot;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&quot;
<p>They told him, &quot;Yes, Lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:29</font></a> Then he touched their
eyes, saying, &quot;According to your faith be it done to
you.&quot;  <a name="C9V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:30</font></a> Their
eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, &quot;See that no one knows about this.&quot;  <a name="C9V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:31</font></a> But they went out and spread
abroad his fame in all that land.
<p> <a name="C9V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:32</font></a> As they went out,
behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.  <a name="C9V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:33</font></a> When the demon was cast out, the
mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, &quot;Nothing like this
has ever been seen in Israel!&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:34</font></a> But the Pharisees
said, &quot;By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.&quot;
<p> <a name="C9V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:35</font></a> Jesus went about all
the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness
among the people.  <a name="C9V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:36</font></a> But
when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because
they were <a href="#N47">harassed</a> and scattered, like sheep without a
shepherd.  <a name="C9V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:37</font></a> Then he said to
his disciples, &quot;The harvest indeed is plentiful, but
the laborers are few.  <a name="C9V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:38</font></a> Pray therefore that the Lord of
the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.&quot;
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> He called to himself
his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> Now the names of the twelve
apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his
brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas;
Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; <a
href="#N48">Lebbaeus, whose surname was</a> Thaddaeus;  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Simon the Canaanite; and Judas
Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<p> <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Jesus sent these
twelve out, and commanded them, saying, &quot;Don't go
among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city of the Samaritans.
 <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> Rather, go to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> As you go, preach, saying, 'The
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'  <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Heal the sick, cleanse the
lepers<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N49">*</a></sup></font>, and cast out demons. Freely you received,
so freely give.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Don't
take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> Take no bag for your journey,
neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his
food.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> Into whatever city
or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until
you go on.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> As you enter
into the household, greet it.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> If the household is worthy, let
your peace come on it, but if it isn't worthy, let your peace return to
you.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> Whoever doesn't
receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that
city, shake off the dust from your feet.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, it
will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that city.
<p> <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> &quot;Behold, I send you out as
sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> But beware of
men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues
they will scourge you.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Yes, and you will be brought
before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the
nations.  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> But when they
deliver you up, don't be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be
given you in that hour what you will say.  <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> For it is not you who speak, but
the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
<p> <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> &quot;Brother will deliver up
brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against
parents, and cause them to be put to death.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> You will be hated by all men for
my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.  <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> But when they persecute you in
this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not
have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.
<p> <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> &quot;A disciple is not above
his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> It is enough for the disciple
that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have
called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his
household!  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Therefore
don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be
revealed; and hidden that will not be known.  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> What I tell you in the darkness,
speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on
the housetops.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Don't be
afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.
Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in <a
href="#N50">Gehenna.</a>
<p> <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> &quot;Aren't two sparrows sold
for an <a href="#N51">assarion coin</a>? Not one of them falls on the
ground apart from your Father's will,  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> but the very hairs of your head
are all numbered.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> Therefore don't be afraid. You
are of more value than many sparrows.  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> Everyone therefore who confesses
me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
 <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> But whoever denies me
before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
<p> <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> &quot;Don't think that I came to
send peace on the earth. I didn't come to send peace, but a sword.  <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> For I came to set a man at odds
against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> A man's foes will be those of
his own household.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N52">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> He who loves father or mother
more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more
than me isn't worthy of me.  <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> He who doesn't take his cross
and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.  <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> He who seeks his life will lose
it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> He who receives you receives me,
and he who receives me receives him who sent me.  <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> He who receives a prophet in the
name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward: and he who receives a
righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous
man's reward.  <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> Whoever
gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the
name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his
reward.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> It happened that when
Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there
to teach and preach in their cities.  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> Now when John heard in the prison
the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> and said to him, &quot;Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
 <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N53">*</a></sup></font> the dead
are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N54">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Blessed is he who finds no
occasion for stumbling in me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> As these went their
way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, &quot;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken by the wind?  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> But
what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear
soft clothing are in king's houses.  <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> But why did you go out? To see a
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> For this is he, of whom it is
written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare
your way before you.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N55">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, among
those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John
the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
he.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> From the days of
John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and
the violent <a href="#N56">take it by force.</a>  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> For all the prophets and the law
prophesied until John.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> If you are willing to receive
it, this is Elijah, who is to come.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> He who has ears to hear, let him
hear.
<p> <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> &quot;But to what shall I
compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces,
who call to their companions  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> and say, 'We played the flute
for you, and you didn't dance. We mourned for you, and you didn't lament.'
 <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> For John came neither
eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend
of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her <a
href="#N57">children.</a>&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> Then he began to
denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done,
because they didn't repent.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> &quot;Woe to
you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been
done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes.  <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> But I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> You, Capernaum, who are exalted
to heaven, you will go down to <a href="#N58">Hades.</a> For if the mighty
works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have
remained until this day.  <a name="C11V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:24</font></a> But I tell you that it will be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C11V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:25</font></a> At that time, Jesus
answered, &quot;I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and
revealed them to infants.  <a name="C11V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:26</font></a> Yes, Father, for so it was
well-pleasing in your sight.  <a name="C11V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:27</font></a> All things have been delivered
to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does
anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to
reveal him.
<p> <a name="C11V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:28</font></a> &quot;Come to me, all you who
labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.  <a name="C11V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:29</font></a> Take my yoke upon you, and learn
from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for
your souls.  <a name="C11V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:30</font></a> For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is light.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> At that time, Jesus
went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were
hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> But the Pharisees, when they saw
it, said to him, &quot;Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do
on the Sabbath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> But he said to them,
&quot;Haven't you read what David did, when he was hungry,
and those who were with him;  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> how he entered into the house of
God, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither
for those who were with him, but only for the priests?<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N59">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> Or have you not read in the law,
that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath,
and are guiltless?  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> But I
tell you that one greater than the temple is here.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> But if you had known what this
means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N60">*</a></sup></font> you would not have
condemned the guiltless.  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> He departed there, and
went into their synagogue.  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> And behold there was a man with
a withered hand. They asked him, &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day?&quot; that they might accuse him.
<p> <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and
if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't he grab on to it,

much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do
good on the Sabbath day.&quot;  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> Then he told the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; He stretched it out;
and it was restored whole, just like the other.  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> But the Pharisees went out, and
conspired against him, how they might destroy him.  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew
from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> and commanded them that they
should not make him known:  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> &quot;Behold, my
servant whom I have chosen;

nor shout;
<dd>neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.

bruised reed.

nations will hope.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p> <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> Then one possessed by
a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the
blind and mute man both spoke and saw.  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> All the multitudes were amazed,
and said, &quot;Can this be the son of David?&quot;  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> But when the Pharisees heard it,
they said, &quot;This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul,
the prince of the demons.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:25</font></a> Knowing their
thoughts, Jesus said to them, &quot;Every kingdom divided
against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided
against itself will not stand.  <a name="C12V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:26</font></a> If Satan casts out Satan, he is
divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?  <a name="C12V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:27</font></a> If I by Beelzebul cast out
demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be
your judges.  <a name="C12V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:28</font></a> But if I by
the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon
you.  <a name="C12V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:29</font></a> Or how can one
enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he
first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.
<p> <a name="C12V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:30</font></a> &quot;He who is not with me is
against me, and he who doesn't gather with me, scatters.  <a name="C12V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:31</font></a> Therefore I tell you, every sin
and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit
will not be forgiven men.  <a name="C12V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:32</font></a> Whoever speaks a word against
the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the

the tree is known by its fruit.  <a name="C12V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:34</font></a> You offspring of vipers, how can
you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart,

good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man

 <a name="C12V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:37</font></a> For by your words you
will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:38</font></a> Then certain of the
scribes and Pharisees answered, &quot;Teacher, we want to see a sign from
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:39</font></a> But he answered them,
&quot;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a
sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
 <a name="C12V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:40</font></a> For as Jonah was three
days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be
three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  <a name="C12V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:41</font></a> The men of Nineveh will stand up
in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah
is here.  <a name="C12V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:42</font></a> The queen of
the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will
condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.  <a name="C12V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:43</font></a> But the unclean spirit, when he
is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and
doesn't find it.  <a name="C12V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:44</font></a> Then he
says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,' and when he has
come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.  <a name="C12V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:45</font></a> Then he goes, and takes with
himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and
dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even
so will it be also to this evil generation.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:46</font></a> While he was yet
speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood
outside, seeking to speak to him.  <a name="C12V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:47</font></a> One said to him, &quot;Behold,
your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C12V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:48</font></a> But he answered him
who spoke to him, &quot;Who is my mother? Who are my
brothers?&quot;  <a name="C12V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:49</font></a> He stretched out his hand
towards his disciples, and said, &quot;Behold, my mother
and my brothers!  <a name="C12V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:50</font></a> For
whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and
sister, and mother.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> On that day Jesus went
out of the house, and sat by the seaside.  <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> Great multitudes gathered to him,
so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on
the beach.  <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> He spoke to
them many things in parables, saying, &quot;Behold, a
farmer went out to sow.  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> As he sowed, some seeds fell by
the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> Others fell on rocky ground,
where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because
they had no depth of earth.  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> When the sun had risen, they were
scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Others fell among thorns. The
thorns grew up and choked them:  <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> and others fell on good soil, and
yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some
thirty.  <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> He who has ears
to hear, let him hear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> The disciples came,
and said to him, &quot;Why do you speak to them in parables?&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> For whoever has, to him will be
given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn't have, from him will
be taken away even that which he has.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Therefore I speak to them in
parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear,
neither do they understand.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> In them the prophecy of Isaiah
is fulfilled, which says, 
<dl>
<dt>'By hearing you will hear,
<dd>and will in no way understand;
<dt>Seeing you will see,
<dd>and will in no way perceive:
<dt> <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> for this people's
heart has grown callous,
<dd>their ears are dull of hearing,
<dd>they have closed their eyes;
<dt>or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,
<dd>hear with their ears,
<dd>understand with their heart,
<dt>and should turn again;
<dd>and I would heal them.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p> <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> &quot;But blessed are your eyes,
for they see; and your ears, for they hear.  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> For most certainly I tell you
that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you
see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and
didn't hear them.
<p> <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> &quot;Hear, then, the parable of
the farmer.  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> When anyone
hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one
comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is
what was sown by the roadside.  <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> What was sown on the rocky
places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives
it;  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> yet he has no root
in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises
because of the word, immediately he stumbles.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> What was sown among the thorns,
this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> What was sown on the good
ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most
certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much,
some sixty, and some thirty.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> He set another
parable before them, saying, &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven
is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> but while people slept, his
enemy came and sowed <a href="#N64">darnel weeds</a> also among the wheat,
and went away.  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> But when
the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds
appeared also.  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> The
servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow
good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?'
<p> <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> &quot;He said to them, 'An enemy
has done this.'
<p>&quot;The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to
go and gather them up?'
<p> <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> &quot;But he said, 'No, lest
perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with
them.  <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Let both grow
together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the
reapers, &quot;First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles
to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> He set another
parable before them, saying, &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven
is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
 <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> which indeed is smaller
than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and
becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its
branches.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> He spoke another
parable to them. &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is like
yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three <a href="#N65">measures</a> of
meal, until it was all leavened.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:34</font></a> Jesus spoke all these
things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't
speak to them,  <a name="C13V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:35</font></a> that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
<dl>
<dt>&quot;I will open my mouth in parables;
<dd>I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the
world.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N66">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C13V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:36</font></a> Then Jesus sent the
multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him,
saying, &quot;Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the
field.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:37</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,  <a name="C13V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:38</font></a> the field is the world; and the
good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are
the children of the evil one.  <a name="C13V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:39</font></a> The enemy who sowed them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
 <a name="C13V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:40</font></a> As therefore the darnel
weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of
this age.  <a name="C13V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:41</font></a> The Son of Man
will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all
things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,  <a name="C13V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:42</font></a> and will cast them into the
furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.  <a name="C13V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:43</font></a> Then the righteous will shine
forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to
hear, let him hear.
<p> <a name="C13V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:44</font></a> &quot;Again, the Kingdom of
Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid.
In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
<p> <a name="C13V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:45</font></a> &quot;Again, the Kingdom of
Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,  <a name="C13V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:46</font></a> who having found one pearl of
great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
<p> <a name="C13V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:47</font></a> &quot;Again, the Kingdom of
Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some
fish of every kind,  <a name="C13V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:48</font></a> which, when it was filled, they
drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into
containers, but the bad they threw away.  <a name="C13V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:49</font></a> So will it be in the end of the
world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the
righteous,  <a name="C13V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:50</font></a> and will cast
them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing
of teeth.&quot;  <a name="C13V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:51</font></a> Jesus said to them, &quot;Have you understood all these things?&quot;
<p>They answered him, &quot;Yes, Lord.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:52</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple
in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings
out of his treasure new and old things.&quot;
<p> <a name="C13V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:53</font></a> It happened that when
Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.  <a name="C13V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:54</font></a> Coming into his own country, he
taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said,
&quot;Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <a name="C13V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:55</font></a> Isn't this the carpenter's son?
Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and
<a href="#N67">Judas</a>?  <a name="C13V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:56</font></a> Aren't all of his sisters with
us? Where then did this man get all of these things?&quot;  <a name="C13V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:57</font></a> They were offended by him.
<p>But Jesus said to them, &quot;A prophet is not without
honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.&quot;
 <a name="C13V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:58</font></a> He didn't do many mighty
works there because of their unbelief.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> At that time, Herod
the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> and said to his servants,
&quot;This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why
these powers work in him.&quot;  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> For Herod had laid hold of John,
and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother
Philip's wife.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> For John
said to him, &quot;It is not lawful for you to have her.&quot;  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> When he would have put him to
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
 <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> But when Herod's birthday
came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.
 <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Whereupon he promised
with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> She, being prompted by her
mother, said, &quot;Give me here on a platter the head of John the
Baptizer.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> The king was grieved,
but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him,
he commanded it to be given,  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> and he sent and beheaded John in
the prison.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> His head was
brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to
her mother.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> His
disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told
Jesus.  <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Now when Jesus
heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart.
When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
<p> <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Jesus went out, and
he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their
sick.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> When evening had
come, his disciples came to him, saying, &quot;This place is deserted, and
the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into
the villages, and buy themselves food.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:16</font></a> But Jesus said to
them, &quot;They don't need to go away. You give them
something to eat.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:17</font></a> They told him,
&quot;We only have here five loaves and two fish.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:18</font></a> He said, &quot;Bring them here to me.&quot;  <a name="C14V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:19</font></a> He commanded the multitudes to
sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the
disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.  <a name="C14V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:20</font></a> They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the
broken pieces.  <a name="C14V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:21</font></a> Those who
ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
<p> <a name="C14V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:22</font></a> Immediately Jesus
made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other
side, while he sent the multitudes away.  <a name="C14V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:23</font></a> After he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had
come, he was there alone.  <a name="C14V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:24</font></a> But the boat was now in the
middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
 <a name="C14V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:25</font></a> In <a href="#N68">the
fourth watch of the night,</a> Jesus came to them, walking on the
sea.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N69">*</a></sup></font>
 <a name="C14V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:26</font></a> When the disciples saw
him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &quot;It's a
ghost!&quot; and they cried out for fear.  <a name="C14V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:27</font></a> But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying &quot;Cheer up! <a href="#N70">It is I!</a>
Don't be afraid.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:28</font></a> Peter answered him
and said, &quot;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the
waters.&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:29</font></a> He said, &quot;Come!&quot;
<p>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to
Jesus.  <a name="C14V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:30</font></a> But when he saw
that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried
out, saying, &quot;Lord, save me!&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:31</font></a> Immediately Jesus
stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, &quot;You of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;
 <a name="C14V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:32</font></a> When they got up into
the boat, the wind ceased.  <a name="C14V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:33</font></a> Those who were in the boat came
and worshiped him, saying, &quot;You are truly the Son of God!&quot;
<p> <a name="C14V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:34</font></a> When they had crossed
over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.  <a name="C14V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:35</font></a> When the people of that place
recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to
him all who were sick,  <a name="C14V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:36</font></a> and they begged him that they
might just touch the <a href="#N71">fringe</a> of his garment. As many as
touched it were made whole.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> Then Pharisees and
scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> &quot;Why do your disciples
disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when
they eat bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> He answered them,
&quot;Why do you also disobey the commandment of God
because of your tradition?  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> For God commanded, 'Honor your
father and your mother,'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N72">*</a></sup></font> and, 'He who speaks evil of father or
mother, let him be put to death.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N73">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> But you say, 'Whoever may tell
his father or his mother, &quot;Whatever help you might otherwise have
gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,&quot;  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> he shall not honor his father or
mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your
tradition.  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> You
hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> 'These people draw
near to me with their mouth,
<dd>and honor me with their lips;
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt> <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> And in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N74">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> He summoned the
multitude, and said to them, &quot;Hear, and understand.
 <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> That which enters into
the mouth doesn't defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the
mouth, this defiles the man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> Then the disciples
came, and said to him, &quot;Do you know that the Pharisees were offended,
when they heard this saying?&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> But he answered,
&quot;Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant
will be uprooted.  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> Leave
them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the
blind, both will fall into a pit.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> Peter answered him,
&quot;Explain the parable to us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> So Jesus said, &quot;Do you also still not understand?  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> Don't you understand that
whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the
body?  <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> But the things
which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the
man.  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> For out of the
heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts,
false testimony, and blasphemies.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> These are the things which
defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the
man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> Jesus went out from
there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> Behold, a Canaanite woman came
out from those borders, and cried, saying, &quot;Have mercy on me, Lord,
you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> But he answered her
not a word.
<p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, &quot;Send her away; for she
cries after us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:24</font></a> But he answered,
&quot;I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:25</font></a> But she came and
worshiped him, saying, &quot;Lord, help me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:26</font></a> But he answered,
&quot;It is not appropriate to take the children's bread
and throw it to the dogs.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:27</font></a> But she said,
&quot;Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their
masters' table.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:28</font></a> Then Jesus answered
her, &quot;Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you
even as you desire.&quot; And her daughter was healed from that
hour.
<p> <a name="C15V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:29</font></a> Jesus departed there,
and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and
sat there.  <a name="C15V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:30</font></a> Great
multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed,
and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
 <a name="C15V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:31</font></a> so that the multitude
wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and
blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel.
<p> <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> Jesus summoned his
disciples and said, &quot;I have compassion on the
multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing
to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the
way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> The disciples said to
him, &quot;Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to
satisfy so great a multitude?&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;How many loaves do you have?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Seven, and a few small fish.&quot;
<p> <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground;  <a name="C15V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:36</font></a> and he took the seven loaves and
the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and
the disciples to the multitudes.  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> They all ate, and were filled.
They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
 <a name="C15V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:38</font></a> Those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children.  <a name="C15V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:39</font></a> Then he sent away the
multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> The Pharisees and
Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from
heaven.  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> But he answered
them, &quot;When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair
weather, for the sky is red.'  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> In the morning, 'It will be foul
weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know
how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs
of the times!  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> An evil and
adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given
to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.&quot;
<p>He left them, and departed.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> The disciples came to the other
side and had forgotten to take bread.  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> Jesus said to them, &quot;Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> They reasoned among
themselves, saying, &quot;We brought no bread.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> Jesus, perceiving it,
said, &quot;Why do you reason among yourselves, you of
little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> Don't you yet perceive, neither
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
took up?  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> Nor the seven
loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?  <a name="C16V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:11</font></a> How is it that you don't
perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the
yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:12</font></a> Then they understood
that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.  <a name="C16V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:13</font></a> Now when Jesus came into the
parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, &quot;Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:14</font></a> They said, &quot;Some
say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the
prophets.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:15</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:16</font></a> Simon Peter answered,
&quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:17</font></a> Jesus answered him,
&quot;Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and
blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
 <a name="C16V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:18</font></a> I also tell you that you
are <a href="#N75">Peter,</a> and on this <a href="#N76">rock</a> I will
build my assembly, and the gates of <a href="#N77">Hades</a> will not
prevail against it.  <a name="C16V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:19</font></a> I
will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind
on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth
will have been released in heaven.&quot;  <a name="C16V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:20</font></a> Then he commanded the disciples
that they should tell no one that he is Jesus the Christ.  <a name="C16V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:21</font></a> From that time, Jesus began to
show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.
<p> <a name="C16V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:22</font></a> Peter took him aside,
and began to rebuke him, saying, &quot;Far be it from you, Lord! This will
never be done to you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C16V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:23</font></a> But he turned, and
said to Peter, &quot;Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of
God, but on the things of men.&quot;  <a name="C16V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:24</font></a> Then Jesus said to his
disciples, &quot;If anyone desires to come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <a name="C16V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:25</font></a> For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find
it.  <a name="C16V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:26</font></a> For what will it
profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what
will a man give in exchange for his life?  <a name="C16V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:27</font></a> For the Son of Man will come in
the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
everyone according to his deeds.  <a name="C16V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:28</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, there
are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see
the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> After six days, Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into
a high mountain by themselves.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> He was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the
light.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> Behold, Moses and
Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
<p> <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> Peter answered, and
said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want,
let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> While he was still
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, &quot;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. Listen to him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> When the disciples
heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> Jesus came and touched them and
said, &quot;Get up, and don't be afraid.&quot;
 <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> Lifting up their eyes,
they saw no one, except Jesus alone.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> As they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, &quot;Don't tell
anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the
dead.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> His disciples asked
him, saying, &quot;Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come
first?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all
things,  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> but I tell you
that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to
him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by
them.&quot;  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> Then
the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
<p> <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> When they came to the
multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> &quot;Lord, have mercy on my
son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into
the fire, and often into the water.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> So I brought him to your
disciples, and they could not cure him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Jesus answered, &quot;Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with
you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.&quot;
 <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> Jesus rebuked him, the
demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
<p> <a name="C17V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:19</font></a> Then the disciples
came to Jesus privately, and said, &quot;Why weren't we able to cast it
out?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:20</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell
you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this
mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be
impossible for you.  <a name="C17V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:21</font></a> But
this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting.&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:22</font></a> While they were
staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, &quot;The Son of
Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,  <a name="C17V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:23</font></a> and they will kill him, and the
third day he will be raised up.&quot;
<p>They were exceedingly sorry.  <a name="C17V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:24</font></a> When they had come to Capernaum,
those who collected the <a href="#N78">didrachma coins</a> came to Peter,
and said, &quot;Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?&quot;  <a name="C17V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:25</font></a> He said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
<p>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, &quot;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the
earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from
strangers?&quot;
<p> <a name="C17V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:26</font></a> Peter said to him,
&quot;From strangers.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to him, &quot;Therefore the children are
exempt.  <a name="C17V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:27</font></a> But, lest we
cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first
fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a <a
href="#N79">stater coin.</a> Take that, and give it to them for me and
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> In that hour the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, &quot;Who then is greatest in the Kingdom
of Heaven?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> Jesus called a little
child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> and said, &quot;Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as
little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
 <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> Whoever therefore humbles
himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> Whoever receives
one such little child in my name receives me,  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> but whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that
a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be
sunk in the depths of the sea.
<p> <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> &quot;Woe to the world because of
occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to
that person through whom the occasion comes!  <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> If your hand or your foot causes
you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into the eternal fire.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> If your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N80">Gehenna</a> of fire.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> See that you don't despise one
of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always
see the face of my Father who is in heaven.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> For the Son of Man came to save
that which was lost.
<p> <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> &quot;What do you think? If a
man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn't he leave
the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
 <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> If he finds it, most
certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine
which have not gone astray.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> Even so it is not the will of
your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
<p> <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> &quot;If your brother sins
against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he
listens to you, you have gained back your brother.  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> But if he doesn't listen, take
one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses
every word may be established.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N81">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> If he refuses to listen to them,
tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him
be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> Most certainly I tell you,
whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
 <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> Again, assuredly I tell
you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they
will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Then Peter came and
said to him, &quot;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I
forgive him? Until seven times?&quot;
<p> <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;I don't tell you until seven times, but, until
seventy times seven.  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
servants.  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> When he had
begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him <a href="#N82">ten
thousand talents.</a>  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> But because he couldn't pay, his
lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that
he had, and payment to be made.  <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> The servant therefore fell down
and kneeled before him, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will
repay you all!'  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> The lord
of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave
him the debt.
<p> <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> &quot;But that servant went out,
and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him <a href="#N83">one
hundred denarii,</a> and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat,
saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
<p> <a name="C18V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:29</font></a> &quot;So his fellow servant fell
down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I
will repay you!'  <a name="C18V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:30</font></a> He
would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back
that which was due.  <a name="C18V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:31</font></a> So
when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry,
and came and told to their lord all that was done.  <a name="C18V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:32</font></a> Then his lord called him in, and
said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you
begged me.  <a name="C18V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:33</font></a> Shouldn't you
also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'
 <a name="C18V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:34</font></a> His lord was angry, and
delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to
him.  <a name="C18V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:35</font></a> So my heavenly
Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your brother from
your hearts for his misdeeds.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> It happened when Jesus
had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> Great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them there.  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> Pharisees came to him, testing
him, and saying, &quot;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> He answered, &quot;Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning
made them male and female,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N84">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> and said, 'For this cause a man
shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two
shall become one flesh?'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N85">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> So that they are no more two, but
one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear
apart.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> They asked him,
&quot;Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and
divorce her?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> He said to them, &quot;Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you
to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> I tell you that whoever divorces
his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits
adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits
adultery.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> His disciples said to
him, &quot;If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not
expedient to marry.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> But he said to them,
&quot;Not all men can receive this saying, but those to
whom it is given.  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> For
there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and
there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who
made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able
to receive it, let him receive it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> Then little children
were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and
the disciples rebuked them.  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> But Jesus said, &quot;Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come
to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.&quot;
 <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> He laid his hands on
them, and departed from there.
<p> <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> Behold, one came to
him and said, &quot;Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may
have eternal life?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> He said to him, &quot;Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is,
God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the
commandments.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> He said to him,
&quot;Which ones?&quot;
<p>Jesus said, &quot;'You shall not murder.' 'You shall
not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false
testimony.'  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> 'Honor your
father and mother.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N86">*</a></sup></font> And, 'You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N87">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C19V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:20</font></a> The young man said to
him, &quot;All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still
lack?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:21</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have,
and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,
follow me.&quot;  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> But when the young man heard the
saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.
 <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> Jesus said to his
disciples, &quot;Most certainly I say to you, a rich man
will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> Again I tell you, it is easier
for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter
into the Kingdom of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> When the disciples
heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, &quot;Who then can be
saved?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> Looking at them,
Jesus said, &quot;With men this is impossible, but with
God all things are possible.&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> Then Peter answered,
&quot;Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we
have?&quot;
<p> <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his
glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> Everyone who has
left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times,
and will inherit eternal life.  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> But many will be last who are
first; and first who are last.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> &quot;For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master
of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his
vineyard.  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> When he had
agreed with the laborers for a <a href="#N88">denarius</a> a day, he sent
them into his vineyard.  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> He went out about the <a
href="#N89">third hour,</a> and saw others standing idle in the
marketplace.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> To them he
said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give
you.' So they went their way.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> Again he went out about the <a
href="#N90">sixth and the ninth hour,</a> and did likewise.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> About the <a href="#N91">eleventh
hour</a> he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them,
'Why do you stand here all day idle?'
<p> <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> &quot;They said to him, 'Because
no one has hired us.'
<p>&quot;He said to them, 'You also go into the
vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.'  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> When evening had come, the lord
of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their
wages, beginning from the last to the first.'
<p> <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> &quot;When those who were hired
at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.  <a name="C20V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:10</font></a> When the first came, they
supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a
denarius.  <a name="C20V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:11</font></a> When they
received it, they murmured against the master of the household,  <a name="C20V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:12</font></a> saying, 'These last have spent
one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat!'
<p> <a name="C20V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:13</font></a> &quot;But he answered one of
them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a
denarius?  <a name="C20V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:14</font></a> Take that
which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just
as much as to you.  <a name="C20V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:15</font></a> Isn't
it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye
evil, because I am good?'  <a name="C20V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:16</font></a> So the last will be first, and
the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:17</font></a> As Jesus was going up
to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said
to them,  <a name="C20V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:18</font></a> &quot;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man
will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn
him to death,  <a name="C20V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:19</font></a> and will
hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the
third day he will be raised up.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:20</font></a> Then the mother of
the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a
certain thing of him.  <a name="C20V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:21</font></a> He
said to her, &quot;What do you want?&quot;
<p>She said to him, &quot;Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on
your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:22</font></a> But Jesus answered,
&quot;You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to
drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;We are able.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:23</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with
the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my
left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by
my Father.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:24</font></a> When the ten heard
it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
<p> <a name="C20V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:25</font></a> But Jesus summoned
them, and said, &quot;You know that the rulers of the
nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over
them.  <a name="C20V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:26</font></a> It shall not be so
among you, but whoever desires to become great among you <a
href="#N92">shall be</a> your servant.  <a name="C20V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:27</font></a> Whoever desires to be first
among you shall be your bondservant,  <a name="C20V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:28</font></a> even as the Son of Man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:29</font></a> As they went out from
Jericho, a great multitude followed him.  <a name="C20V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:30</font></a> Behold, two blind men sitting by
the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out,
&quot;Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!&quot;  <a name="C20V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:31</font></a> The multitude rebuked them,
telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more,
&quot;Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:32</font></a> Jesus stood still,
and called them, and asked, &quot;What do you want me to
do for you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:33</font></a> They told him,
&quot;Lord, that our eyes may be opened.&quot;
<p> <a name="C20V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:34</font></a> Jesus, being moved
with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received
their sight, and they followed him.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> When they drew near to
Jerusalem, and came to <a href="#N93">Bethsphage,</a> to the Mount of
Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> saying to them, &quot;Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately
you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring
them to me.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> If anyone
says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and
immediately he will send them.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> All this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> &quot;Tell the
daughter of Zion,
<dd>behold, your King comes to you,
<dd>humble, and riding on a donkey,
<dd>on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N94">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> The disciples went,
and did just as Jesus commanded them,  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> and brought the donkey and the
colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> A very great multitude spread
their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread
them on the road.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> The
multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, &quot;<a
href="#N95">Hosanna</a> to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N96">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> When he had come into
Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, &quot;Who is this?&quot;
 <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> The multitudes said,
&quot;This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> Jesus entered into
the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the
temple, and overthrew the money changers' tables and the seats of those
who sold the doves.  <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> He
said to them, &quot;It is written, 'My house shall be
called a house of prayer,'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N97">*</a></sup></font> but you have made it a den of
robbers!&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N98">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C21V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:14</font></a> The blind and the
lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.  <a name="C21V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:15</font></a> But when the chief priests and
the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who
were crying in the temple and saying, &quot;Hosanna to the son of
David!&quot; they were indignant,  <a name="C21V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:16</font></a> and said to him, &quot;Do you
hear what these are saying?&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;Yes. Did you never read, 'Out
of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected
praise?'&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N99">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C21V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:17</font></a> He left them, and
went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.  <a name="C21V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:18</font></a> Now in the morning, as he
returned to the city, he was hungry.  <a name="C21V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:19</font></a> Seeing a fig tree by the road,
he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, &quot;Let there be no fruit from you forever!&quot;
<p>Immediately the fig tree withered away.  <a name="C21V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:20</font></a> When the disciples saw it, they
marveled, saying, &quot;How did the fig tree immediately wither away?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:21</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and
don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even
if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would
be done.  <a name="C21V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:22</font></a> All things,
whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:23</font></a> When he had come into
the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as
he was teaching, and said, &quot;By what authority do you do these things?
Who gave you this authority?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:24</font></a> Jesus answered them,
&quot;I also will ask you one question, which if you tell
me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.  <a name="C21V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:25</font></a> The baptism of John, where was
it from? From heaven or from men?&quot;
<p>They reasoned with themselves, saying, &quot;If we say, 'From heaven,'
he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'  <a name="C21V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:26</font></a> But if we say, 'From men,' we
fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.&quot;  <a name="C21V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:27</font></a> They answered Jesus, and said,
&quot;We don't know.&quot;
<p>He also said to them, &quot;Neither will I tell you by
what authority I do these things.  <a name="C21V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:28</font></a> But what do you think? A man had
two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my
vineyard.'  <a name="C21V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:29</font></a> He answered,
'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind, and went.  <a name="C21V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:30</font></a> He came to the second, and said
the same thing. He answered, 'I go, sir,' but he didn't go.  <a name="C21V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:31</font></a> Which of the two did the will of
his father?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;The first.&quot;
<p>Jesus said to them, &quot;Most certainly I tell you
that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom
of God before you.  <a name="C21V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:32</font></a> For
John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him,
but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it,
you didn't even repent afterward, that you might believe him.
<p> <a name="C21V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:33</font></a> &quot;Hear another parable.
There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard,
set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out
to farmers, and went into another country.  <a name="C21V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:34</font></a> When the season for the fruit
drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
 <a name="C21V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:35</font></a> The farmers took his
servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.  <a name="C21V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:36</font></a> Again, he sent other servants
more than the first: and they treated them the same way.  <a name="C21V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:37</font></a> But afterward he sent to them
his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'  <a name="C21V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:38</font></a> But the farmers, when they saw
the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him,
and seize his inheritance.'  <a name="C21V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:39</font></a> So they took him, and threw him
out of the vineyard, and killed him.  <a name="C21V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:40</font></a> When therefore the lord of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:41</font></a> They told him,
&quot;He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out
the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its
season.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:42</font></a> Jesus said to them,
&quot;Did you never read in the Scriptures,
<dl>
<dt>'The stone which the builders rejected,
<dd>the same was made the head of the corner.
<dt>This was from the Lord.
<dd>It is marvelous in our eyes?'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N100">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C21V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:43</font></a> &quot;Therefore I tell you, the
Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation
bringing forth its fruit.  <a name="C21V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:44</font></a> He who falls on this stone will
be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as
dust.&quot;
<p> <a name="C21V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:45</font></a> When the chief
priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke
about them.  <a name="C21V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:46</font></a> When they
sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered
him to be a prophet.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> Jesus answered and
spoke again in parables to them, saying,  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> &quot;The Kingdom
of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
 <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> and sent out his servants
to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not
come.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> Again he sent out
other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, &quot;Behold, I have
made ready my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things
are ready. Come to the marriage feast!&quot;'  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> But they made light of it, and
went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> and the rest grabbed his
servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> When the king heard that, he was
angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their
city.
<p> <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> &quot;Then he said to his
servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't
worthy.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> Go therefore to
the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to
the marriage feast.'  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> Those servants went out into the
highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good.
The wedding was filled with guests.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> But when the king came in to see
the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,
 <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> and he said to him,
'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was
speechless.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> Then the
king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and
throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding
of teeth will be.'  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> For
many are called, but few chosen.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> Then the Pharisees
went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> They sent their disciples to
him, along with the Herodians, saying, &quot;Teacher, we know that you are
honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for
you aren't partial to anyone.  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> Tell us therefore, what do you
think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> But Jesus perceived
their wickedness, and said, &quot;Why do you test me, you
hypocrites?  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> Show me the
tax money.&quot;
<p>They brought to him a denarius.
<p> <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> He asked them, &quot;Whose is this image and inscription?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> They said to him,
&quot;Caesar's.&quot;
<p>Then he said to them, &quot;Give therefore to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> When they heard it,
they marveled, and left him, and went away.
<p> <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> On that day Sadducees
(those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,
 <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> saying, &quot;Teacher,
Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry
his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> Now there were with us seven
brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to
his brother.  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> In like
manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.  <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> After them all, the woman died.
 <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> In the resurrection
therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> But Jesus answered
them, &quot;You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> For in the resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in
heaven.  <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> But concerning
the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to
you by God, saying,  <a name="C22V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:32</font></a> 'I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N101">*</a></sup></font> God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:33</font></a> When the multitudes
heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.  <a name="C22V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:34</font></a> But the Pharisees, when they
heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
 <a name="C22V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:35</font></a> One of them, a lawyer,
asked him a question, testing him.  <a name="C22V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:36</font></a> &quot;Teacher, which is the
greatest commandment in the law?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:37</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;'You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N102">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C22V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:38</font></a> This is the first and great
commandment.  <a name="C22V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:39</font></a> A second
likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N103">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C22V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:40</font></a> The whole law and the prophets
depend on these two commandments.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:41</font></a> Now while the
Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,  <a name="C22V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:42</font></a> saying, &quot;What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is
he?&quot;
<p>They said to him, &quot;Of David.&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:43</font></a> He said to them,
&quot;How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord,
saying,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C22V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:44</font></a> 'The Lord said to my
Lord,
<dd>sit on my right hand,
<dd>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N104">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C22V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:45</font></a> &quot;If then David calls him
Lord, how is he his son?&quot;
<p> <a name="C22V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:46</font></a> No one was able to
answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions
from that day forth.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> Then Jesus spoke to
the multitudes and to his disciples,  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> saying, &quot;The
scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.  <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> All things therefore whatever
they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don't do their works; for
they say, and don't do.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> For they bind heavy burdens that
are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they
themselves will not lift a finger to help them.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> But all their works they do to be
seen by men. They make their <a href="#N105">phylacteries</a> broad,
enlarge the <a href="#N106">fringes</a> of their garments,  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> and love the place of honor at
feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> the salutations in the
marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men.  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> But don't you be called 'Rabbi,'
for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> Call no man on the earth your
father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> Neither be called masters, for
one is your master, the Christ.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> But he who is greatest among you
will be your servant.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> Whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and
as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater
condemnation.

Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one
proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of

swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'  <a name="C23V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:17</font></a> You blind fools! For which is
greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?  <a name="C23V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:18</font></a> 'Whoever swears by the altar, it
is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is
obligated?'  <a name="C23V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:19</font></a> You blind

gift?  <a name="C23V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:20</font></a> He therefore who
swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.  <a name="C23V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:21</font></a> He who swears by the temple,
swears by it, and by him who was living in it.  <a name="C23V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:22</font></a> He who swears by heaven, swears
by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.

Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and <a

law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not
to have left the other undone.  <a name="C23V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:24</font></a> You blind guides, who strain out
a gnat, and swallow a camel!

also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of
hypocrisy and iniquity.

Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and
decorate the tombs of the righteous,  <a name="C23V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:30</font></a> and say, 'If we had lived in the
days of our fathers, we wouldn't have been partakers with them in the
blood of the prophets.'  <a name="C23V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:31</font></a> Therefore you testify to
yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.  <a name="C23V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:32</font></a> Fill up, then, the measure of

and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from

you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed

immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened,
the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and
the powers of the heavens will be shaken;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N115">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C24V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:30</font></a> and then the sign of the Son of
Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with
power and great glory.  <a name="C24V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:31</font></a> He will send out his angels with
a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones
from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
<p> <a name="C24V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:32</font></a> &quot;Now from the fig tree
learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth
its leaves, you know that the summer is near.  <a name="C24V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:33</font></a> Even so you also, when you see
all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.  <a name="C24V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:34</font></a> Most certainly I tell you, this
<a href="#N116">generation</a> will not pass away, until all these things
are accomplished.  <a name="C24V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:35</font></a> Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.  <a name="C24V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:36</font></a> But no one knows of that day and
hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
<p> <a name="C24V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:37</font></a> &quot;As the days of Noah were,
so will be the coming of the Son of Man.  <a name="C24V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:38</font></a> For as in those days which were
before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,  <a name="C24V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:39</font></a> and they didn't know until the
flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of
Man.  <a name="C24V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:40</font></a> Then two men will
be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;  <a name="C24V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:41</font></a> two women grinding at the mill,
one will be taken and one will be left.  <a name="C24V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:42</font></a> Watch therefore, for you don't
know in what hour your Lord comes.  <a name="C24V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:43</font></a> But know this, that if the
master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was
coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be
broken into.  <a name="C24V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:44</font></a> Therefore
also be ready, for in an hour that you don't expect, the Son of Man will
come.
<p> <a name="C24V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:45</font></a> &quot;Who then is the faithful
and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them
their food in due season?  <a name="C24V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:46</font></a> Blessed is that servant whom his
lord finds doing so when he comes.  <a name="C24V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:47</font></a> Most certainly I tell you that
he will set him over all that he has.  <a name="C24V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:48</font></a> But if that evil servant should
say in his heart, 'My lord is delaying his coming,'  <a name="C24V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:49</font></a> and begins to beat his fellow
servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,  <a name="C24V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:50</font></a> the lord of that servant will
come in a day when he doesn't expect it, and in an hour when he doesn't
know it,  <a name="C24V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:51</font></a> and will cut
him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where
the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.
<p> <a name="C25V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:1</font></a> &quot;Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who
took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.  <a name="C25V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:2</font></a> Five of them were foolish, and
five were wise.  <a name="C25V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:3</font></a> Those who
were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,  <a name="C25V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:4</font></a> but the wise took oil in their
vessels with their lamps.  <a name="C25V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:5</font></a> Now while the bridegroom delayed,
they all slumbered and slept.  <a name="C25V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:6</font></a> But at midnight there was a cry,
'Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!'  <a name="C25V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:7</font></a> Then all those virgins arose, and
<a href="#N117">trimmed their lamps.</a>  <a name="C25V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:8</font></a> The foolish said to the wise,
'Give us  some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'  <a name="C25V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:9</font></a> But the wise answered, saying,
'What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who
sell, and buy for yourselves.'  <a name="C25V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:10</font></a> While they went away to buy, the
bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage
feast, and the door was shut.  <a name="C25V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:11</font></a> Afterward the other virgins also
came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'  <a name="C25V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:12</font></a> But he answered, 'Most certainly
I tell you, I don't know you.'  <a name="C25V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:13</font></a> Watch therefore, for you don't
know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
<p> <a name="C25V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:14</font></a> &quot;For it is like a man,
going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his
goods to them.  <a name="C25V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:15</font></a> To one he
gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to
his own ability. Then he went on his journey.  <a name="C25V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:16</font></a> Immediately he who received the
five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
 <a name="C25V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:17</font></a> In like manner he also
who got the two gained another two.  <a name="C25V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:18</font></a> But he who received the one went
away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
<p> <a name="C25V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:19</font></a> &quot;Now after a long time the
lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.  <a name="C25V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:20</font></a> He who received the five talents
came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me
five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.'
<p> <a name="C25V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:21</font></a> &quot;His lord said to him,
'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few
things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
<p> <a name="C25V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:22</font></a> &quot;He also who got the two
talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I
have gained another two talents besides them.'
<p> <a name="C25V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:23</font></a> &quot;His lord said to him,
'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few
things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
<p> <a name="C25V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:24</font></a> &quot;He also who had received
the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man,
reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
 <a name="C25V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:25</font></a> I was afraid, and went
away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'
<p> <a name="C25V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:26</font></a> &quot;But his lord answered him,
'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow,
and gather where I didn't scatter.  <a name="C25V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:27</font></a> You ought therefore to have
deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have
received back my own with interest.  <a name="C25V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:28</font></a> Take away therefore the talent
from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.  <a name="C25V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:29</font></a> For to everyone who has will be
given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn't have, even
that which he has will be taken away.  <a name="C25V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:30</font></a> Throw out the unprofitable
servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.'
<p> <a name="C25V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:31</font></a> &quot;But when the Son of Man
comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on
the throne of his glory.  <a name="C25V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:32</font></a> Before him all the nations will
be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd
separates the sheep from the goats.  <a name="C25V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:33</font></a> He will set the sheep on his
right hand, but the goats on the left.  <a name="C25V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:34</font></a> Then the King will tell those on
his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world;  <a name="C25V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:35</font></a> for I was hungry, and you gave
me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger,
and you took me in;  <a name="C25V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:36</font></a> naked, and you clothed me; I was
sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.'
<p> <a name="C25V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:37</font></a> &quot;Then the righteous will
answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or
thirsty, and give you a drink?  <a name="C25V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:38</font></a> When did we see you as a
stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?  <a name="C25V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:39</font></a> When did we see you sick, or in
prison, and come to you?'
<p> <a name="C25V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:40</font></a> &quot;The King will answer them,
'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of
these my <a href="#N118">brothers</a>, you did it to me.'  <a name="C25V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:41</font></a> Then he will say also to those
on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which
is prepared for the devil and his angels;  <a name="C25V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:42</font></a> for I was hungry, and you didn't
give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;  <a name="C25V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:43</font></a> I was a stranger, and you didn't
take me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you
didn't visit me.'
<p> <a name="C25V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:44</font></a> &quot;Then they will also
answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a
stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?'
<p> <a name="C25V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:45</font></a> &quot;Then he will answer them,
saying, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of
the least of these, you didn't do it to me.'  <a name="C25V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">25:46</font></a> These will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:1</font></a> It happened, when
Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,  <a name="C26V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:2</font></a> &quot;You know
that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be crucified.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:3</font></a> Then the chief
priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together
in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.  <a name="C26V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:4</font></a> They took counsel together that
they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.  <a name="C26V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:5</font></a> But they said, &quot;Not during
the feast, lest a riot occur among the people.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:6</font></a> Now when Jesus was in
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  <a name="C26V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:7</font></a> a woman came to him having an
alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as
he sat at the table.  <a name="C26V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:8</font></a> But
when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, &quot;Why this
waste?  <a name="C26V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:9</font></a> For this ointment
might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:10</font></a> However, knowing
this, Jesus said to them, &quot;Why do you trouble the
woman? Because she has done a good work for me.  <a name="C26V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:11</font></a> For you always have the poor
with you; but you don't always have me.  <a name="C26V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:12</font></a> For in pouring this ointment on
my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.  <a name="C26V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:13</font></a> Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman
has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:14</font></a> Then one of the
twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,  <a name="C26V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:15</font></a> and said, &quot;What are you
willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?&quot; They weighed
out for him thirty pieces of silver.  <a name="C26V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:16</font></a> From that time he sought
opportunity to betray him.
<p> <a name="C26V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:17</font></a> Now on the first day
of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him,
&quot;Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:18</font></a> He said, &quot;Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The
Teacher says, &quot;My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your
house with my disciples.&quot;'&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:19</font></a> The disciples did as
Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.  <a name="C26V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:20</font></a> Now when evening had come, he
was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.  <a name="C26V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:21</font></a> As they were eating, he said,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you that one of you will
betray me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:22</font></a> They were exceedingly
sorrowful, and each began to ask him, &quot;It isn't me, is it, Lord?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:23</font></a> He answered, &quot;He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will
betray me.  <a name="C26V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:24</font></a> The Son of
Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom
the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not
been born.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:25</font></a> Judas, who betrayed
him, answered, &quot;It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?&quot;
<p>He said to him, &quot;You said it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:26</font></a> As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, <a href="#N119">gave thanks for</a> it, and broke it. He
gave to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take, eat; this is
my body.&quot;  <a name="C26V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:27</font></a> He
took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, &quot;All of you drink it,  <a name="C26V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:28</font></a> for this is my blood of the new
covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.  <a name="C26V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:29</font></a> But I tell you that I will not
drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink
it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom.&quot;  <a name="C26V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:30</font></a> When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p> <a name="C26V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:31</font></a> Then Jesus said to
them, &quot;All of you will be made to stumble because of
me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
of the flock will be scattered.'<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N120">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C26V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:32</font></a> But after I am raised up, I will
go before you into Galilee.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:33</font></a> But Peter answered
him, &quot;Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will
never be made to stumble.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:34</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:35</font></a> Peter said to him,
&quot;Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.&quot; All of the
disciples also said likewise.
<p> <a name="C26V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:36</font></a> Then Jesus came with
them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, &quot;Sit here, while I go there and pray.&quot;  <a name="C26V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:37</font></a> He took with him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
 <a name="C26V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:38</font></a> Then he said to them,
&quot;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
Stay here, and watch with me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:39</font></a> He went forward a
little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, &quot;My
Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless,
not what I desire, but what you desire.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:40</font></a> He came to the
disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &quot;What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?  <a name="C26V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:41</font></a> Watch and pray, that you don't
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:42</font></a> Again, a second time
he went away, and prayed, saying, &quot;My Father, if this
cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be
done.&quot;  <a name="C26V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:43</font></a> He
came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.  <a name="C26V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:44</font></a> He left them again, went away,
and prayed a third time, saying the same words.  <a name="C26V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:45</font></a> Then he came to his disciples,
and said to them, &quot;Sleep on now, and take your rest.
Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners.  <a name="C26V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:46</font></a> Arise, let's
be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:47</font></a> While he was still
speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the
people.  <a name="C26V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:48</font></a> Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, &quot;Whoever I kiss, he is the
one. Seize him.&quot;  <a name="C26V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:49</font></a> Immediately he came to Jesus,
and said, &quot;Hail, Rabbi!&quot; and kissed him.
<p> <a name="C26V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:50</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;Friend, why are you here?&quot; Then they
came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <a name="C26V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:51</font></a> Behold, one of those who were
with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.  <a name="C26V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:52</font></a> Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take
the sword will die by the sword.  <a name="C26V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:53</font></a> Or do you think that I couldn't
ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of
angels?  <a name="C26V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:54</font></a> How then would
the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:55</font></a> In that hour Jesus
said to the multitudes, &quot;Have you come out as against
a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple
teaching, and you didn't arrest me.  <a name="C26V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:56</font></a> But all this has happened, that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&quot;
<p>Then all the disciples left him, and fled.  <a name="C26V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:57</font></a> Those who had taken Jesus led
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders
were gathered together.  <a name="C26V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:58</font></a> But Peter followed him from a
distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the
officers, to see the end.  <a name="C26V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:59</font></a> Now the chief priests, the
elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that
they might put him to death;  <a name="C26V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:60</font></a> and they found none. Even though
many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false
witnesses came forward,  <a name="C26V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:61</font></a> and said, &quot;This man said,
'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three
days.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:62</font></a> The high priest stood
up, and said to him, &quot;Have you no answer? What is this that these
testify against you?&quot;  <a name="C26V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:63</font></a> But Jesus held his peace. The
high priest answered him, &quot;I adjure you by the living God, that you
tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:64</font></a> Jesus said to him,
&quot;You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after
this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and
coming on the clouds of the sky.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:65</font></a> Then the high priest
tore his clothing, saying, &quot;He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need
any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.  <a name="C26V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:66</font></a> What do you think?&quot;
<p>They answered, &quot;He is worthy of death!&quot;  <a name="C26V67"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:67</font></a> Then they spit in his face and
beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,  <a name="C26V68"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:68</font></a> saying, &quot;Prophesy to us,
you Christ! Who hit you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V69"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:69</font></a> Now Peter was sitting
outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, &quot;You were also
with Jesus, the Galilean!&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V70"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:70</font></a> But he denied it
before them all, saying, &quot;I don't know what you are talking
about.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V71"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:71</font></a> When he had gone out
onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there,
&quot;This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V72"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:72</font></a> Again he denied it
with an oath, &quot;I don't know the man.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V73"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:73</font></a> After a little while
those who stood by came and said to Peter, &quot;Surely you are also one
of them, for your speech makes you known.&quot;
<p> <a name="C26V74"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:74</font></a> Then he began to
curse and to swear, &quot;I don't know the man!&quot;
<p>Immediately the rooster crowed.  <a name="C26V75"><font size=-1 color="blue">26:75</font></a> Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said to him, &quot;Before the rooster crows, you will deny me
three times.&quot; He went out and wept bitterly.
<p> <a name="C27V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:1</font></a> Now when morning had
come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel
against Jesus to put him to death:  <a name="C27V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:2</font></a> and they bound him, and led him
away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.  <a name="C27V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:3</font></a> Then Judas, who betrayed him,
when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,  <a name="C27V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:4</font></a> saying, &quot;I have sinned in
that I betrayed innocent blood.&quot;
<p>But they said, &quot;What is that to us? You see to it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:5</font></a> He threw down the
pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged
himself.  <a name="C27V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:6</font></a> The chief
priests took the pieces of silver, and said, &quot;It's not lawful to put
them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.&quot;  <a name="C27V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:7</font></a> They took counsel, and bought the
potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.  <a name="C27V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:8</font></a> Therefore that field was called
&quot;The Field of Blood&quot; to this day.  <a name="C27V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:9</font></a> Then that which was spoken
through <a href="#N121">Jeremiah</a> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;They took the thirty pieces of silver,
<dd>the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
<dd>whom some of the children of Israel priced,
<dt> <a name="C27V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:10</font></a> and they gave them
for the potter's field,
<dd>as the Lord commanded me.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N122">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C27V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:11</font></a> Now Jesus stood
before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, &quot;Are you the
King of the Jews?&quot;
<p>Jesus said to him, &quot;So you say.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:12</font></a> When he was accused
by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  <a name="C27V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:13</font></a> Then Pilate said to him,
&quot;Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:14</font></a> He gave him no
answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.  <a name="C27V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:15</font></a> Now at the feast the governor
was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they
desired.  <a name="C27V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:16</font></a> They had then a
notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <a name="C27V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:17</font></a> When therefore they were
gathered together, Pilate said to them, &quot;Whom do you want me to
release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?&quot;  <a name="C27V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:18</font></a> For he knew that because of envy
they had delivered him up.
<p> <a name="C27V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:19</font></a> While he was sitting
on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, &quot;Have nothing to
do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him.&quot;  <a name="C27V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:20</font></a> Now the chief priests and the
elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
 <a name="C27V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:21</font></a> But the governor
answered them, &quot;Which of the two do you want me to release to
you?&quot;
<p>They said, &quot;Barabbas!&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:22</font></a> Pilate said to them,
&quot;What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?&quot;
<p>They all said to him, &quot;Let him be crucified!&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:23</font></a> But the governor
said, &quot;Why? What evil has he done?&quot;
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, &quot;Let him be
crucified!&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:24</font></a> So when Pilate saw
that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting,
he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, &quot;I
am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:25</font></a> All the people
answered, &quot;May his blood be on us, and on our children!&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:26</font></a> Then he released to
them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.  <a name="C27V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:27</font></a> Then the governor's soldiers
took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him.  <a name="C27V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:28</font></a> They
stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.  <a name="C27V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:29</font></a> They braided a crown of thorns
and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled
down before him, and mocked him, saying, &quot;Hail, King of the
Jews!&quot;  <a name="C27V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:30</font></a> They spat on
him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.  <a name="C27V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:31</font></a> When they had mocked him, they
took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to
crucify him.
<p> <a name="C27V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:32</font></a> As they came out,
they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go
with them, that he might carry his cross.  <a name="C27V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:33</font></a> They came to a place called
&quot;Golgotha,&quot; that is to say, &quot;The place of a skull.&quot;
 <a name="C27V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:34</font></a> They gave him sour wine
to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
 <a name="C27V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:35</font></a> When they had crucified
him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N123">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C27V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:36</font></a> and they sat and watched him
there.  <a name="C27V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:37</font></a> They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, &quot;THIS IS JESUS, THE KING
OF THE JEWS.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:38</font></a> Then there were two
robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
 <a name="C27V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:39</font></a> Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads,  <a name="C27V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:40</font></a> and saying, &quot;You who
destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are
the Son of God, come down from the cross!&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:41</font></a> Likewise the chief
priests also mocking, with the scribes, <a href="#N124">the Pharisees,</a>
and the elders, said,  <a name="C27V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:42</font></a> &quot;He saved others, but he
can't save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from
the cross now, and we will believe in him.  <a name="C27V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:43</font></a> He trusts in God. Let God
deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of
God.'&quot;  <a name="C27V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:44</font></a> The robbers
also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
<p> <a name="C27V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:45</font></a> Now from the <a
href="#N125">sixth hour</a> there was darkness over all the land until the
<a href="#N126">ninth hour.</a>  <a name="C27V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:46</font></a> About the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, &quot;Eli, Eli, <a
href="#N127">lima</a> sabachthani?&quot; That is, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N128">*</a></sup></font>
<p> <a name="C27V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:47</font></a> Some of them who
stood there, when they heard it, said, &quot;This man is calling
Elijah.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:48</font></a> Immediately one of
them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him a drink.  <a name="C27V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:49</font></a> The rest said, &quot;Let him be.
Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:50</font></a> Jesus cried again
with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.  <a name="C27V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:51</font></a> Behold, the veil of the temple
was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks
were split.  <a name="C27V52"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:52</font></a> The tombs
were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised;  <a name="C27V53"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:53</font></a> and coming out
of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and
appeared to many.  <a name="C27V54"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:54</font></a> Now
the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw
the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying,
&quot;Truly this was the Son of God.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V55"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:55</font></a> Many women were there
watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
 <a name="C27V56"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:56</font></a> Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons
of Zebedee.  <a name="C27V57"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:57</font></a> When evening
had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also
Jesus' disciple came.  <a name="C27V58"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:58</font></a> This man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
 <a name="C27V59"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:59</font></a> Joseph took the body,
and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <a name="C27V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:60</font></a> and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door
of the tomb, and departed.  <a name="C27V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:61</font></a> Mary Magdalene was there, and
the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.  <a name="C27V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:62</font></a> Now on the next day, which was
the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate,  <a name="C27V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:63</font></a> saying, &quot;Sir, we remember
what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will
rise again.'  <a name="C27V64"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:64</font></a> Command
therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps
his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He
is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the
first.&quot;
<p> <a name="C27V65"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:65</font></a> Pilate said to them,
&quot;You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.&quot;  <a name="C27V66"><font size=-1 color="blue">27:66</font></a> So they went with the guard and
made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
<p> <a name="C28V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:1</font></a> Now after the Sabbath,
as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary came to see the tomb.  <a name="C28V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:2</font></a> Behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and
rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.  <a name="C28V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:3</font></a> His appearance was like
lightning, and his clothing white as snow.  <a name="C28V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:4</font></a> For fear of him, the guards
shook, and became like dead men.  <a name="C28V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:5</font></a> The angel answered the women,
&quot;Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been
crucified.  <a name="C28V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:6</font></a> He is not
here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord was lying.  <a name="C28V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:7</font></a> Go
quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold,
he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have
told you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:8</font></a> They departed quickly
from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples
word.  <a name="C28V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:9</font></a> As they went to
tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, &quot;Rejoice!&quot;
<p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<p> <a name="C28V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:10</font></a> Then Jesus said to
them, &quot;Don't be afraid. Go tell my <a
href="#N129">brothers</a> that they should go into Galilee, and there they
will see me.&quot;
<p> <a name="C28V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:11</font></a> Now while they were
going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief
priests all the things that had happened.  <a name="C28V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:12</font></a> When they were assembled with
the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to
the soldiers,  <a name="C28V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:13</font></a> saying,
&quot;Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
slept.  <a name="C28V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:14</font></a> If this comes to
the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of
worry.&quot;  <a name="C28V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:15</font></a> So they
took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad
among the Jews, and continues until this day.
<p> <a name="C28V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:16</font></a> But the eleven
disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
 <a name="C28V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:17</font></a> When they saw him, they
bowed down to him, but some doubted.  <a name="C28V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:18</font></a> Jesus came to them and spoke to
them, saying, &quot;All authority has been given to me in
heaven and on earth.  <a name="C28V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:19</font></a> Therefore go, and make disciples
of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit,  <a name="C28V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">28:20</font></a> teaching them to observe all
things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
of the age.&quot; Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
