<h1>
Paul's Letter to Philemon
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, a prisoner of Christ
Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
 <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to the beloved Apphia, to
Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Grace to you and peace from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p> <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> I thank my God always,
making mention of you in my prayers,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> hearing of your love, and of the
faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
 <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> that the fellowship of
your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing
which is in us in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> For we have much joy and comfort
in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through
you, brother.
<p> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Therefore, though I
have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
 <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> yet for love's sake I
rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> I beg you
for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, <a
href="#N1">Onesimus,</a>  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> who once was useless to you, but
now is useful to you and to me.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> I am sending him back. Therefore
receive him, that is, my own heart,  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> whom I desired to keep with me,
that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
 <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> But I was willing to do
nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of
necessity, but of free will.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> For perhaps he was therefore
separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> no longer as a slave, but more
than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to
you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> If then you count me a
partner, receive him as you would receive me.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> But if he has wronged you at all,
or owes you anything, put that to my account.  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> I, Paul, write this with my own
hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your
own self besides).  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Yes,
brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the
Lord.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> Having confidence
in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond
what I say.
<p> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Also, prepare a guest
room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to
you.
<p> <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> Epaphras, my fellow
prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,
and Luke, my fellow workers.  <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Philemon ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web5710h.htm or web5710h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web5711h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web5710ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p><a href="http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05">http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05</a> or<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03">ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03</a></p>

<p>Or /etext04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90</p>

<p>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you
want,<br>as it appears in our Newsletters.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>

Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br>
809 North 1500 West<br>
Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>

method other than by check or money order.</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>

efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
