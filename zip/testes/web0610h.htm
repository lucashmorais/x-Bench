<h1>
Joshua
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Now it happened after the
death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son
of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> Moses my servant is dead; now
therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the
land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> I have given you every place that
the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> From the wilderness, and this
Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the
Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
your border.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> No man will
be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with
Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Be strong and of good courage; for
you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their
fathers to give them.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Only
be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law,
which Moses my servant commanded you. Don't turn from it to the right hand
or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> This book of the law shall not
depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that
you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then
you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
 <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Haven't I commanded you?
Be strong and of good courage. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: for
Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.
<p> <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Then Joshua commanded
the officers of the people, saying,  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> &quot;Pass through the midst of
the camp, and command the people, saying, 'Prepare food; for within three
days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which
Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Joshua spoke to the
Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
 <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> &quot;Remember the word
which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God
gives you rest, and will give you this land.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> Your wives, your little ones, and
your livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the
Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
men of valor, and shall help them  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> until Yahweh has given your
brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land
which Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of
your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave
you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> They answered Joshua,
saying, &quot;All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you
send us we will go.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> Just
as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may
Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Whoever rebels against your
commandment, and doesn't listen to your words in all that you command him,
he shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Joshua the son of Nun
secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, &quot;Go, view the
land, and Jericho.&quot; They went and came into the house of a prostitute
whose name was Rahab, and slept there.
<p> <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The king of Jericho was
told, &quot;Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to
spy out the land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> The king of Jericho
sent to Rahab, saying, &quot;Bring out the men who have come to you, who
have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the
land.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> The woman took the two
men and hid them. Then she said, &quot;Yes, the men came to me, but I
didn't know where they came from.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> It happened about the time of the
shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the
men went, I don't know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake
them.&quot;  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> But she had
brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which
she had laid in order on the roof.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> The men pursued them the way to
the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone
out, they shut the gate.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Before they had laid down, she
came up to them on the roof;  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> and she said to the men, &quot;I
know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has
fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before
you.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> For we have heard
how Yahweh dried up the water of the <a href="#N1">Red Sea</a> before you,
when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the
Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly
destroyed.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> As soon as we
had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit
in any man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven
above, and on earth beneath.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> Now therefore, please swear to me
by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal
kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> and that you will save alive my
father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have,
and will deliver our lives from death.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> The men said to her,
&quot;Our life for yours, if you don't talk about this business of ours;
and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly
and truly with you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Then she let them down
by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall,
and she lived on the wall.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> She said to them, &quot;Go to the
mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three
days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your
way.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> The men said to her,
&quot;We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to
swear.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Behold, when we
come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the
window which you did let us down by. You shall gather to yourself into the
house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's
household.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> It shall be
that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his
blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you
in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.
 <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> But if you talk about
this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you
have made us to swear.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> She said,
&quot;According to your words, so be it.&quot; She sent them away, and
they departed. She tied the scarlet line in the window.
<p> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> They went, and came to
the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had
returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find
them.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Then the two men
returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the
son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> They said to Joshua, &quot;Truly
Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the
inhabitants of the land melt away before us.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Joshua rose up early in
the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and
all the children of Israel. They lodged there before they passed over.
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> It happened after three
days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> and they commanded the people,
saying, &quot;When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and
the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
and follow it.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Yet there
shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure.
Don't come near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for
you have not passed this way before.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Joshua said to the
people, &quot;Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders
among you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> Joshua spoke to the
priests, saying, &quot;Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over
before the people.&quot; They took up the ark of the covenant, and went
before the people.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua,
&quot;Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that
they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> You shall command the priests who
bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink of the
waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Joshua said to the
children of Israel, &quot;Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your
God.&quot;  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> Joshua said,
&quot;Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he
will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite,
and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite
out from before you.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Behold, the ark of the covenant
of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.
 <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Now therefore take twelve
men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> It shall come to pass, when the
soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of
all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the
Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and
they shall stand in one heap.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> It happened, when the
people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who
bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> and when those who bore the ark
had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had
dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks
all the time of harvest),  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> that the waters which came down
from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the
city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of
the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed
over right against Jericho.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> The priests who bore the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the
Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had
passed completely over the Jordan.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> It happened, when all
the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying,  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> &quot;Take
twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> and command them, saying, 'Take
from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests'
feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Then Joshua called the
twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every
tribe a man.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> Joshua said
to them, &quot;Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle
of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your
shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
 <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> that this may be a sign
among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do
you mean by these stones?'  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> then you shall tell them, 'Because
the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut
off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel
forever.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> The children of Israel
did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of
the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the
tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to
the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Joshua set up twelve stones in the
middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore
the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> For the priests who bore the ark
stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that
Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that
Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> It happened, when all the people
had completely passed over, that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the
priests, in the presence of the people.
<p> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> The children of
Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed
over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> About forty thousand men, ready
and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of
Jericho.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> On that day,
Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him,
as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
<p> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying,  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> &quot;Command the priests who
bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.&quot;
<p> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> Joshua therefore
commanded the priests, saying, &quot;Come up out of the Jordan!&quot;
 <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> It happened, when the
priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the
middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to
the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and
went over all its banks, as before.  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> The people came up out of the
Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the
east border of Jericho.
<p> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Joshua set up those
twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, n Gilgal.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> He spoke to the children of
Israel, saying, &quot;When your children ask their fathers in time to
come, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> Then you shall let your children
know, saying, 'Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.  <a name="C4V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:23</font></a> For Yahweh your God dried up the
waters of the Jordan from before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh
your God did to the <a href="#N2">Red Sea</a>, which he dried up from
before us, until we had passed over;  <a name="C4V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:24</font></a> that all the peoples of the earth
may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh
your God forever.'&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> It happened, when all
the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all
the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh
had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there
spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> At that time, Yahweh said to
Joshua, &quot;Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of
Israel the second time.&quot;  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> Joshua made himself flint knives,
and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
 <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> This is the reason Joshua
circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even
all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out
of Egypt.  <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> For all the
people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in
the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been
circumcised.  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> For the
children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the
nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because
they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore to them that he
wouldn't let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he
would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> Their children, whom he raised up
in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
because they had not circumcised them on the way.  <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> It happened, when they were done
circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp
until they were healed.
<p> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua,
&quot;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.&quot;
Therefore the name of that place was called <a href="#N3">Gilgal,</a> to
this day.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> The children of
Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of
the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> They ate unleavened cakes and
parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the
Passover, in the same day.  <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> The manna ceased on the next day,
after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel
didn't have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of
Canaan that year.
<p> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> It happened, when
Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold,
a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went
to him, and said to him, &quot;Are you for us, or for our
adversaries?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> He said, &quot;No; but
I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army.&quot;
<p>Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him,
&quot;What does my lord say to his servant?&quot;
<p> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> The prince of Yahweh's
army said to Joshua, &quot;Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place
on which you stand is holy.&quot; Joshua did so.
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Now Jericho was tightly
shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one
came in.  <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> Yahweh said to
Joshua, &quot;Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king
and the mighty men of valor.  <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> All your men of war shall march
around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.
 <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> Seven priests shall bear
seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you
shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the
trumpets.  <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> It shall be that
when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the
sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up
every man straight before him.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Joshua the son of Nun
called the priests, and said to them, &quot;Take up the ark of the
covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
the ark of Yahweh.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> They said to the
people, &quot;Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass
on before Yahweh's ark.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:8</font></a> It was so, that when
Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven
trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets; and
the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.  <a name="C6V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:9</font></a> The armed men went before the
priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets
sounded as they went.
<p> <a name="C6V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:10</font></a> Joshua commanded the
people, saying, &quot;You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard,
neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you
to shout. Then you shall shout.&quot;  <a name="C6V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:11</font></a> So he caused the ark of Yahweh to
go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and
lodged in the camp.  <a name="C6V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:12</font></a> Joshua rose early in the morning,
and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.  <a name="C6V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:13</font></a> The seven priests bearing the
seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on
continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them.
The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh. The trumpets sounded as they
went.  <a name="C6V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:14</font></a> The second day they
marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this
six days.
<p> <a name="C6V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:15</font></a> It happened on the
seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched
around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched
around the city seven times.  <a name="C6V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:16</font></a> It happened at the seventh time,
when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people,
&quot;Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!  <a name="C6V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:17</font></a> The city shall be devoted, even
it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live,
she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers
that we sent.  <a name="C6V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:18</font></a> But as for
you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have
devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of
Israel accursed, and trouble it.  <a name="C6V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:19</font></a> But all the silver, and gold, and
vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into
Yahweh's treasury.&quot;
<p> <a name="C6V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:20</font></a> So the people shouted,
and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the
sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the
wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man
straight before him, and they took the city.  <a name="C6V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:21</font></a> They utterly destroyed all that
was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and
sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.  <a name="C6V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:22</font></a> Joshua said to the two men who
had spied out the land, &quot;Go into the prostitute's house, and bring
out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.&quot;
 <a name="C6V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:23</font></a> The young men who were
spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her
brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives,
and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.  <a name="C6V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:24</font></a> They burnt the city with fire,
and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the
vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.  <a name="C6V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:25</font></a> But Rahab the prostitute, her
father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in
the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom
Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
<p> <a name="C6V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:26</font></a> Joshua commanded them
with an oath at that time, saying, &quot;Cursed be the man before Yahweh,
who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn
shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall
he set up its gates.&quot;  <a name="C6V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:27</font></a> So Yahweh was with Joshua; and
his fame was in all the land.
<p> <a name="C7V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:1</font></a> But the children of
Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of
Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of
the devoted thing: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the
children of Israel.  <a name="C7V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:2</font></a> Joshua
sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side
of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. The men
went up and spied out Ai.  <a name="C7V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:3</font></a> They returned to Joshua, and said
to him, Don't let all the people go up; but let about two or three
thousand men go up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;
for they are but few.  <a name="C7V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:4</font></a> So
there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled
before the men of Ai.  <a name="C7V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:5</font></a> The
men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they chased them
<I>from</I> before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the
descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.  <a name="C7V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:6</font></a> Joshua tore his clothes, and fell
to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he
and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.  <a name="C7V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:7</font></a> Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh,
why have you at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us
into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had
been content and lived beyond the Jordan!  <a name="C7V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:8</font></a> Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after
that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!  <a name="C7V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:9</font></a> For the Canaanites and all the
inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and
cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?
 <a name="C7V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:10</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua,
Get you up; why are you thus fallen on your face?  <a name="C7V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:11</font></a> Israel has sinned; yes, they have
even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yes, they have even
taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and
they have even put it among their own stuff.  <a name="C7V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:12</font></a> Therefore the children of Israel
can't stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their
enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any
more, except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.  <a name="C7V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:13</font></a> Up, sanctify the people, and say,
Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not
stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing from
among you.  <a name="C7V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:14</font></a> In the morning
therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that
the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come near by families; and the family
which Yahweh shall take shall come near by households; and the household
which Yahweh shall take shall come near man by man.  <a name="C7V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:15</font></a> It shall be, that he who is taken
with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has;
because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has
done folly in Israel.  <a name="C7V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:16</font></a> So
Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their
tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:  <a name="C7V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:17</font></a> and he brought near the family of
Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the
family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:  <a name="C7V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:18</font></a> and he brought near his household
man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of
Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.  <a name="C7V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:19</font></a> Joshua said to Achan, My son,
please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to
him; and tell me now what you have done; don't hide it from me.  <a name="C7V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:20</font></a> Achan answered Joshua, and said,
Of a truth I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and
thus have I done:  <a name="C7V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:21</font></a> when I
saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of
silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them,
and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my
tent, and the silver under it.  <a name="C7V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:22</font></a> So Joshua sent messengers, and
they ran to the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver
under it.  <a name="C7V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:23</font></a> They took them
from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the
children of Israel; and they laid them down before Yahweh.  <a name="C7V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:24</font></a> Joshua, and all Israel with him,
took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge
of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his cattle, and his donkeys,
and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up
to the valley of Achor.  <a name="C7V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:25</font></a> Joshua said, Why have you
troubled us? Yahweh shall trouble you this day. All Israel stoned him with
stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
 <a name="C7V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">7:26</font></a> They raised over him a
great heap of stones, to this day; and Yahweh turned from the fierceness
of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called &quot;The valley
of Achor&quot; to this day.
<p> <a name="C8V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:1</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua,
Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: take all the people of war with you,
and arise, go up to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of
Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;  <a name="C8V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:2</font></a> You shall do to Ai and her king as
you did to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its livestock, you
shall take for a prey to yourselves: set you an ambush for the city behind
it.  <a name="C8V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:3</font></a> So Joshua arose, and
all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty
thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.
 <a name="C8V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:4</font></a> He commanded them, saying,
Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; don't
go very far from the city, but be all ready:  <a name="C8V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:5</font></a> and I, and all the people who are
with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out
against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;  <a name="C8V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:6</font></a> and they will come out after us,
until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee
before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;  <a name="C8V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:7</font></a> and you shall rise up from the
ambush, and take possession of the city: for Yahweh your God will deliver
it into your hand.  <a name="C8V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:8</font></a> It
shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on
fire; according to the word of Yahweh you shall do: behold, I have
commanded you.  <a name="C8V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:9</font></a> Joshua sent
them forth; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel
and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the
people.  <a name="C8V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:10</font></a> Joshua arose up
early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the
elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  <a name="C8V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:11</font></a> All the people, <I>even</I> the
<I>men of</I> war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came
before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a
valley between him and Ai.  <a name="C8V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:12</font></a> He took about five thousand men,
and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the
city.  <a name="C8V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:13</font></a> So they set the
people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their
ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst
of the valley.  <a name="C8V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:14</font></a> It
happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early,
and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his
people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn't know that
there was an ambush against him behind the city.  <a name="C8V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:15</font></a> Joshua and all Israel made as if
they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
 <a name="C8V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:16</font></a> All the people who were
in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued
after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  <a name="C8V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:17</font></a> There was not a man left in Ai or
Beth El, who didn't go out after Israel: and they left the city open, and
pursued after Israel.  <a name="C8V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:18</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch
out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into
your hand. Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward
the city.  <a name="C8V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:19</font></a> The ambush
arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched
out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hurried and
set the city on fire.  <a name="C8V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:20</font></a> When the men of Ai looked behind
them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven,
and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people who
fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.  <a name="C8V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:21</font></a> When Joshua and all Israel saw
that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city
ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.  <a name="C8V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:22</font></a> The others came forth out of the
city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them
remain or escape.  <a name="C8V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:23</font></a> The
king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <a name="C8V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:24</font></a> It happened, when Israel had made
an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the
wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the
edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to
Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.  <a name="C8V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:25</font></a> All that fell that day, both of
men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.  <a name="C8V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:26</font></a> For Joshua didn't draw back his
hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly
destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <a name="C8V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:27</font></a> Only the livestock and the spoil
of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of
Yahweh which he commanded Joshua.  <a name="C8V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:28</font></a> So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a
heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.  <a name="C8V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:29</font></a> The king of Ai he hanged on a
tree until the evening: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded,
and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of
the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, to this
day.  <a name="C8V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:30</font></a> Then Joshua built an
altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,  <a name="C8V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:31</font></a> as Moses the servant of Yahweh
commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law
of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any
iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh, and sacrificed
peace offerings.  <a name="C8V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:32</font></a> He wrote
there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the
presence of the children of Israel.  <a name="C8V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:33</font></a> All Israel, and their elders and
officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side
before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh, as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front of
Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal; as Moses the
servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the
people of Israel.  <a name="C8V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:34</font></a> Afterward he read all the words
of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written
in the book of the law.  <a name="C8V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">8:35</font></a> There was not a word of all that
Moses commanded, which Joshua didn't read before all the assembly of
Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the foreigners who were
among them.
<p> <a name="C9V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:1</font></a> It happened, when all
the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the
lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the
Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and
the Jebusite, heard of it;  <a name="C9V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:2</font></a> that they gathered themselves
together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.  <a name="C9V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:3</font></a> But when the inhabitants of Gibeon
heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,  <a name="C9V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:4</font></a> they also resorted to a ruse, and
went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their
donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,  <a name="C9V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:5</font></a> and old and patched shoes on their
feet, and old garments on them; and all the bread of their provision was
dry and was become moldy.  <a name="C9V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:6</font></a> They went to Joshua to the camp at
Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far
country: now therefore make you a covenant with us.  <a name="C9V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:7</font></a> The men of Israel said to the
Hivites, What if you dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with
you?  <a name="C9V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:8</font></a> They said to Joshua,
We are your servants. Joshua said to them, Who are you? and from whence
come you?  <a name="C9V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:9</font></a> They said to
him, From a very far country your servants are come because of the name of
Yahweh your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in
Egypt,  <a name="C9V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:10</font></a> and all that he
did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon
king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.  <a name="C9V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:11</font></a> Our elders and all the
inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your
hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your
servants: and now make you a covenant with us.  <a name="C9V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:12</font></a> This our bread we took hot for
our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but
now, behold, it is dry, and is become moldy:  <a name="C9V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:13</font></a> and these wineskins, which we
filled, were new; and behold, they are torn: and these our garments and
our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.  <a name="C9V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:14</font></a> The men took of their provision,
and didn't ask counsel at the mouth of Yahweh.  <a name="C9V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:15</font></a> Joshua made peace with them, and
made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the
congregation swore to them.  <a name="C9V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:16</font></a> It happened at the end of three
days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they
were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.  <a name="C9V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:17</font></a> The children of Israel traveled,
and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.  <a name="C9V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:18</font></a> The children of Israel didn't
strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by
Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the
princes.  <a name="C9V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:19</font></a> But all the
princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the
God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.  <a name="C9V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:20</font></a> This we will do to them, and let
them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to
them.  <a name="C9V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:21</font></a> The princes said to
them, Let them live: so they became wood cutters and drawers of water to
all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.  <a name="C9V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:22</font></a> Joshua called for them, and he
spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far
from you; when you dwell among us?  <a name="C9V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:23</font></a> Now therefore you are cursed, and
there shall never fail to be of you bondservants, both wood cutters and
drawers of water for the house of my God.  <a name="C9V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:24</font></a> They answered Joshua, and said,
Because it was certainly told your servants, how that Yahweh your God
commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all
the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid
for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  <a name="C9V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:25</font></a> Now, behold, we are in your hand:
as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do.  <a name="C9V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:26</font></a> So did he to them, and delivered
them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they didn't kill
them.  <a name="C9V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">9:27</font></a> That day Joshua
made those wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation, and for
the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which he should choose.
<p> <a name="C10V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:1</font></a> Now it happened, when
Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had
utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had
done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
with Israel, and were among them;  <a name="C10V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:2</font></a> that they feared greatly, because
Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was
greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.  <a name="C10V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:3</font></a> Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of
Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and
to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,  <a name="C10V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:4</font></a> Come up to me, and help me, and
let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the
children of Israel.  <a name="C10V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:5</font></a> Therefore the five kings of the
Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth,
the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and
went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made
war against it.  <a name="C10V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:6</font></a> The men
of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Don't slack your
hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:
for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are
gathered together against us.  <a name="C10V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:7</font></a> So Joshua went up from Gilgal,
he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
 <a name="C10V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:8</font></a> Yahweh said to Joshua,
Don't fear them: for I have delivered them into your hands; there shall
not a man of them stand before you.  <a name="C10V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:9</font></a> Joshua therefore came on them
suddenly; <I>for</I> he went up from Gilgal all the night.  <a name="C10V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:10</font></a> Yahweh confused them before
Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased
them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,
and to Makkedah.  <a name="C10V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:11</font></a> It
happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent
of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from the sky on them to
Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than
they whom the children of Israel killed with the sword.  <a name="C10V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:12</font></a> Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in
the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of
Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still on
Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.  <a name="C10V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:13</font></a> The sun stood still, and the
moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.
Isn't this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of
the sky, and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.  <a name="C10V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:14</font></a> There was no day like that
before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man: for
Yahweh fought for Israel.  <a name="C10V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:15</font></a> Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, to the camp to Gilgal.  <a name="C10V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:16</font></a> These five kings fled, and hid
themselves in the cave at Makkedah.  <a name="C10V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:17</font></a> It was told Joshua, saying, The
five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.  <a name="C10V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:18</font></a> Joshua said, Roll great stones
to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:  <a name="C10V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:19</font></a> but don't stay; pursue after
your enemies, and strike the hindmost of them; don't allow them to enter
into their cities: for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.
 <a name="C10V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:20</font></a> It happened, when Joshua
and the children of Israel had made an end of killing them with a very
great slaughter, until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
of them had entered into the fortified cities,  <a name="C10V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:21</font></a> that all the people returned to
the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any
of the children of Israel.  <a name="C10V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:22</font></a> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth
of the cave, and bring forth those five kings to me out of the cave.
 <a name="C10V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:23</font></a> They did so, and brought
forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the
king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of
Eglon.  <a name="C10V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:24</font></a> It happened, when
they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the
men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,
Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. They came near, and
put their feet on the necks of them.  <a name="C10V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:25</font></a> Joshua said to them, Don't be
afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall
Yahweh do to all your enemies against whom you fight.  <a name="C10V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:26</font></a> Afterward Joshua struck them,
and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were
hanging on the trees until the evening.  <a name="C10V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:27</font></a> It happened at the time of the
going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off
the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden
themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very
day.  <a name="C10V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:28</font></a> Joshua took
Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its
king: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were therein; he
left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to
the king of Jericho.  <a name="C10V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:29</font></a> Joshua passed from Makkedah, and
all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:  <a name="C10V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:30</font></a> and Yahweh delivered it also,
and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of
the sword, and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in
it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.  <a name="C10V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:31</font></a> Joshua passed from Libnah, and
all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought
against it:  <a name="C10V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:32</font></a> and Yahweh
delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second
day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were
therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.  <a name="C10V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:33</font></a> Then Horam king of Gezer came up
to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left
him none remaining.  <a name="C10V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:34</font></a> Joshua passed from Lachish, and
all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought
against it;  <a name="C10V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:35</font></a> and they
took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword; and all the
souls who were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all
that he had done to Lachish.  <a name="C10V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:36</font></a> Joshua went up from Eglon, and
all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:  <a name="C10V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:37</font></a> and they took it, and struck it
with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the
souls who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he
had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were
therein.  <a name="C10V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:38</font></a> Joshua
returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:
 <a name="C10V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:39</font></a> and he took it, and its
king, and all its cities; and they struck them with the edge of the sword,
and utterly destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none
remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king;
as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.  <a name="C10V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:40</font></a> So Joshua struck all the land,
the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all
their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that
breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.  <a name="C10V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:41</font></a> Joshua struck them from Kadesh
Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
 <a name="C10V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:42</font></a> All these kings and
their land did Joshua take at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel,
fought for Israel.  <a name="C10V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">10:43</font></a> Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
<p> <a name="C11V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:1</font></a> It happened, when
Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and
to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,  <a name="C11V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:2</font></a> and to the kings who were on the
north, in the hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in
the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,  <a name="C11V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:3</font></a> to the Canaanite on the east and
on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of
Mizpah.  <a name="C11V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:4</font></a> They went out,
they and all their armies with them, much people, even as the sand that is
on the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.  <a name="C11V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:5</font></a> All these kings met together; and
they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with
Israel.  <a name="C11V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:6</font></a> Yahweh said to
Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time will I
deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall hamstring their horses,
and burn their chariots with fire.  <a name="C11V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:7</font></a> So Joshua came, and all the
people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and
fell on them.  <a name="C11V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:8</font></a> Yahweh
delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased
them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh
eastward; and they struck them, until they left them none remaining.
 <a name="C11V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:9</font></a> Joshua did to them as
Yahweh bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with
fire.  <a name="C11V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:10</font></a> Joshua turned back
at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for
Hazor before was the head of all those kingdoms.  <a name="C11V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:11</font></a> They struck all the souls who
were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there
was none left who breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.  <a name="C11V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:12</font></a> All the cities of those kings,
and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he struck them with the
edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of
Yahweh commanded.  <a name="C11V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:13</font></a> But as
for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them,
save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.  <a name="C11V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:14</font></a> All the spoil of these cities,
and the livestock, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves;
but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had
destroyed them, neither left they any who breathed.  <a name="C11V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:15</font></a> As Yahweh commanded Moses his
servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing
undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C11V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:16</font></a> So Joshua took all that land,
the hill country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the
lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland
of the same;  <a name="C11V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:17</font></a> from Mount
Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon
under Mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and struck them, and put
them to death.  <a name="C11V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:18</font></a> Joshua
made war a long time with all those kings.  <a name="C11V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:19</font></a> There was not a city that made
peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of
Gibeon: they took all in battle.  <a name="C11V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:20</font></a> For it was of Yahweh to harden
their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly
destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy
them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <a name="C11V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:21</font></a> Joshua came at that time, and
cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from
Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill
country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
 <a name="C11V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:22</font></a> There was none of the
Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath,
and in Ashdod, did some remain.  <a name="C11V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">11:23</font></a> So Joshua took the whole land,
according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an
inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The
land had rest from war.
<p> <a name="C12V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:1</font></a> Now these are the
kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their
land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to
Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:  <a name="C12V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:2</font></a> Sihon king of the Amorites, who
lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley
of the Arnon, and <I>the city that is in</I> the middle of the valley, and
half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of
Ammon;  <a name="C12V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:3</font></a> and the Arabah to
the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the
Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the
slopes of Pisgah:  <a name="C12V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:4</font></a> and the
border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at
Ashtaroth and at Edrei,  <a name="C12V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:5</font></a> and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in
Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.  <a name="C12V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:6</font></a> Moses the servant of Yahweh and
the children of Israel struck them: and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave
it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe
of Manasseh.  <a name="C12V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:7</font></a> These are
the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond
the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount
Halak, that goes up to Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel
for a possession according to their divisions;  <a name="C12V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:8</font></a> in the hill country, and in the
lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and
in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  <a name="C12V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:9</font></a> the king of Jericho, one; the
king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;  <a name="C12V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:10</font></a> the king of Jerusalem, one; the
king of Hebron, one;  <a name="C12V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:11</font></a> the
king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;  <a name="C12V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:12</font></a> the king of Eglon, one; the king
of Gezer, one;  <a name="C12V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:13</font></a> the king
of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;  <a name="C12V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:14</font></a> the king of Hormah, one; the
king of Arad, one;  <a name="C12V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:15</font></a> the
king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;  <a name="C12V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:16</font></a> the king of Makkedah, one; the
king of Bethel, one;  <a name="C12V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:17</font></a> the
king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;  <a name="C12V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:18</font></a> the king of Aphek, one; the king
of Lassharon, one;  <a name="C12V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:19</font></a> the
king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;  <a name="C12V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:20</font></a> the king of Shimron Meron, one;
the king of Achshaph, one;  <a name="C12V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:21</font></a> the king of Taanach, one; the
king of Megiddo, one;  <a name="C12V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:22</font></a> the king of Kedesh, one; the
king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;  <a name="C12V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:23</font></a> the king of Dor in the height of
Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;  <a name="C12V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">12:24</font></a> the king of Tirzah, one: all the
kings thirty-one.
<p> <a name="C13V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:1</font></a> Now Joshua was old and
well stricken in years; and Yahweh said to him, You are old and well
stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
 <a name="C13V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:2</font></a> This is the land that yet
remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
 <a name="C13V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:3</font></a> from the Shihor, which is
before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, <I>which</I> is
reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the
Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the
Ekronites; also the Avvim,  <a name="C13V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:4</font></a> on the south; all the land of the
Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the
border of the Amorites;  <a name="C13V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:5</font></a> and the land of the Gebalites,
and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to
the entrance of Hamath;  <a name="C13V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:6</font></a> all the inhabitants of the hill
country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will
I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot you it to
Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.  <a name="C13V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:7</font></a> Now therefore divide this land
for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
 <a name="C13V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:8</font></a> With him the Reubenites
and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond
the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:
 <a name="C13V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:9</font></a> from Aroer, that is on
the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of
the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;  <a name="C13V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:10</font></a> and all the cities of Sihon king
of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of
Ammon;  <a name="C13V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:11</font></a> and Gilead, and
the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and
all Bashan to Salecah;  <a name="C13V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:12</font></a> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of
the Rephaim); for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.  <a name="C13V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:13</font></a> Nevertheless the children of
Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur
and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.  <a name="C13V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:14</font></a> Only to the tribe of Levi he
gave no inheritance; the offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by
fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.  <a name="C13V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:15</font></a> Moses gave to the tribe of the
children of Reuben according to their families.  <a name="C13V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:16</font></a> Their border was from Aroer,
that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in
the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;  <a name="C13V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:17</font></a> Heshbon, and all its cities that
are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,  <a name="C13V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:18</font></a> and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and
Mephaath,  <a name="C13V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:19</font></a> and
Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley,
 <a name="C13V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:20</font></a> and Beth Peor, and the
slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,  <a name="C13V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:21</font></a> and all the cities of the plain,
and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,
whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.  <a name="C13V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:22</font></a> Balaam also the son of Beor, the
soothsayer, did the children of Israel kill with the sword among the rest
of their slain.  <a name="C13V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:23</font></a> The
border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border <I>of
it</I>. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to
their families, the cities and its villages.  <a name="C13V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:24</font></a> Moses gave to the tribe of Gad,
to the children of Gad, according to their families.  <a name="C13V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:25</font></a> Their border was Jazer, and all
the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer
that is before Rabbah;  <a name="C13V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:26</font></a> and from Heshbon to Ramath
Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;  <a name="C13V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:27</font></a> and in the valley, Beth Haram,
and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon
king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border <I>of it</I>, to the uttermost
part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.  <a name="C13V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:28</font></a> This is the inheritance of the
children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
 <a name="C13V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:29</font></a> Moses gave
<I>inheritance</I> to the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the
half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.
 <a name="C13V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:30</font></a> Their border was from
Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the
towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities:  <a name="C13V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:31</font></a> and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth,
and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the
children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
of Machir according to their families.  <a name="C13V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:32</font></a> These are the inheritances which
Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho,
eastward.  <a name="C13V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">13:33</font></a> But to the
tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Yahweh, the God of Israel, is
their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
<p> <a name="C14V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:1</font></a> These are the
inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan,
which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the
fathers' <I>houses</I> of the tribes of the children of Israel,
distributed to them,  <a name="C14V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:2</font></a> by
the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine
tribes, and for the half-tribe.  <a name="C14V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:3</font></a> For Moses had given the
inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but to
the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.  <a name="C14V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:4</font></a> For the children of Joseph were
two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites
in the land, save cities to dwell in, with its suburbs for their livestock
and for their substance.  <a name="C14V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:5</font></a> As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the
children of Israel did; and they divided the land.  <a name="C14V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:6</font></a> Then the children of Judah drew
near to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite
said to him, You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.  <a name="C14V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:7</font></a> Forty years old was I when Moses
the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and
I brought him word again as it was in my heart.  <a name="C14V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:8</font></a> Nevertheless my brothers who went
up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh
my God.  <a name="C14V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:9</font></a> Moses swore on
that day, saying, Surely the land whereon your foot has trodden shall be
an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have
wholly followed Yahweh my God.  <a name="C14V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:10</font></a> Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me
alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh
spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now,
behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.  <a name="C14V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:11</font></a> As yet I am as strong this day
as I as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is
my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.  <a name="C14V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:12</font></a> Now therefore give me this hill
country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how
the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that
Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
 <a name="C14V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:13</font></a> Joshua blessed him; and
he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  <a name="C14V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:14</font></a> Therefore Hebron became the
inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day;
because that he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C14V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">14:15</font></a> Now the name of Hebron before
was Kiriath Arba; <I>which Arba was</I> the greatest man among the Anakim.
The land had rest from war.
<p> <a name="C15V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:1</font></a> The lot for the tribe
of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of
Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of
the south.  <a name="C15V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:2</font></a> Their south
border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that
looks southward;  <a name="C15V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:3</font></a> and it
went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and
went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and
went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;  <a name="C15V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:4</font></a> and it passed along to Azmon, and
went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at
the sea: this shall be your south border.  <a name="C15V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:5</font></a> The east border was the Salt Sea,
even to the end of the Jordan. The border of the north quarter was from
the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;  <a name="C15V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:6</font></a> and the border went up to Beth
Hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went
up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;  <a name="C15V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:7</font></a> and the border went up to Debir
from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is
over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the
river; and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and the
goings out of it were at En Rogel;  <a name="C15V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:8</font></a> and the border went up by the
valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward (the
same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that
lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part
of the valley of Rephaim northward;  <a name="C15V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:9</font></a> and the border extended from the
top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out
to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same
is Kiriath Jearim);  <a name="C15V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:10</font></a> and
the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed
along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and
went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;  <a name="C15V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:11</font></a> and the border went out to the
side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed
along to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the
border were at the sea.  <a name="C15V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:12</font></a> The west border was to the great
sea, and the border <I>of it</I>. This is the border of the children of
Judah according to their families.  <a name="C15V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:13</font></a> To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he
gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment
of Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath Arba, <I>which Arba was</I> the father
of Anak (the same is Hebron).  <a name="C15V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:14</font></a> Caleb drove out there the three
sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
 <a name="C15V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:15</font></a> He went up there against
the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
 <a name="C15V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:16</font></a> Caleb said, He who
strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter as wife.  <a name="C15V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:17</font></a> Othniel the son of Kenaz, the
brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
 <a name="C15V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:18</font></a> It happened, when she
came <I>to him</I>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and
she alighted from off her donkey; and Caleb said, What would you?  <a name="C15V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:19</font></a> She said, Give me a blessing;
for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of
water. He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.  <a name="C15V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:20</font></a> This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.  <a name="C15V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:21</font></a> The uttermost cities of the
tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were
Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,  <a name="C15V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:22</font></a> and Kinah, and Dimonah, and
Adadah,  <a name="C15V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:23</font></a> and Kedesh, and

Sansannah,  <a name="C15V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:32</font></a> and Lebaoth,
and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty-nine, with
their villages.  <a name="C15V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:33</font></a> In the
lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,  <a name="C15V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:34</font></a> and Zanoah, and En Gannim,
Tappuah, and Enam,  <a name="C15V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:35</font></a> Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and

villages.  <a name="C15V37"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:37</font></a> Zenan, and

villages;  <a name="C15V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:46</font></a> from Ekron
even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
 <a name="C15V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:47</font></a> Ashdod, its towns and
its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and
the great sea, and the border <I>of it</I>.  <a name="C15V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:48</font></a> In the hill country, Shamir, and
Jattir, and Socoh,  <a name="C15V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:49</font></a> and
Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),  <a name="C15V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:50</font></a> and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and

Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.  <a name="C15V60"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:60</font></a> Kiriath Baal (the same is
Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.  <a name="C15V61"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:61</font></a> In the wilderness, Beth Arabah,
Middin, and Secacah,  <a name="C15V62"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:62</font></a> and
Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities with their
villages.  <a name="C15V63"><font size=-1 color="blue">15:63</font></a> As for the
Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn't
drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at
Jerusalem to this day.
<p> <a name="C16V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:1</font></a> The lot came out for
the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of
Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through
the hill country to Bethel;  <a name="C16V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:2</font></a> and it went out from Bethel to
Luz, and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth;  <a name="C16V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:3</font></a> and it went down westward to the
border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to
Gezer; and the goings out of it were at the sea.  <a name="C16V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:4</font></a> The children of Joseph, Manasseh
and Ephraim, took their inheritance.  <a name="C16V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:5</font></a> The border of the children of
Ephraim according to their families was <I>thus</I>: the border of their
inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;  <a name="C16V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:6</font></a> and the border went out westward
at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward to
Taanath Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;  <a name="C16V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:7</font></a> and it went down from Janoah to
Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached to Jericho, and went out at the
Jordan.  <a name="C16V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:8</font></a> From Tappuah the
border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out of it
were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
Ephraim according to their families;  <a name="C16V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:9</font></a> together with the cities which
were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance
of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.  <a name="C16V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">16:10</font></a> They didn't drive out the
Canaanites who lived in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of
Ephraim to this day, and are become servants to do forced labor.
<p> <a name="C17V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:1</font></a> <I>This</I> was the
lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for
Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a
man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.  <a name="C17V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:2</font></a> So <I>the lot</I> was for the
rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the
children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children
of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of
Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.  <a name="C17V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:3</font></a> But Zelophehad, the son of
Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no
sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and
Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.  <a name="C17V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:4</font></a> They came near before Eleazar the
priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying,
Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:
therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an
inheritance among the brothers of their father.  <a name="C17V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:5</font></a> There fell ten parts to Manasseh,
besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;  <a name="C17V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:6</font></a> because the daughters of Manasseh
had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest
of the sons of Manasseh.  <a name="C17V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:7</font></a> The border of Manasseh was from
Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along
to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.  <a name="C17V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:8</font></a> The land of Tappuah belonged to
Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children
of Ephraim.  <a name="C17V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:9</font></a> The border
went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities
belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of
Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out of it were
at the sea:  <a name="C17V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:10</font></a> southward it
was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his
border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the
east.  <a name="C17V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:11</font></a> Manasseh had in
Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns,
and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and
its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the
inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.  <a name="C17V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:12</font></a> Yet the children of Manasseh
couldn't drive out <I>the inhabitants of</I> those cities; but the
Canaanites would dwell in that land.  <a name="C17V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:13</font></a> It happened, when the children
of Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor,
and didn't utterly drive them out.  <a name="C17V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:14</font></a> The children of Joseph spoke to
Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an
inheritance, seeing I am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has
blessed me?  <a name="C17V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:15</font></a> Joshua said
to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest, and cut down for
yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the
hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.  <a name="C17V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:16</font></a> The children of Joseph said, The
hill country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites who dwell in the
land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean
and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.  <a name="C17V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:17</font></a> Joshua spoke to the house of
Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people,
and have great power; you shall not have one lot only:  <a name="C17V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">17:18</font></a> but the hill country shall be
yours; for though it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and the goings
out of it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though
they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
<p> <a name="C18V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:1</font></a> The whole congregation
of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set
up the Tent of Meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
 <a name="C18V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:2</font></a> There remained among the
children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their
inheritance.  <a name="C18V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:3</font></a> Joshua said
to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go in to possess the
land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?  <a name="C18V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:4</font></a> Appoint for you three men of each
tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the
land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come
to me.  <a name="C18V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:5</font></a> They shall divide
it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and
the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.  <a name="C18V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:6</font></a> You shall describe the land into
seven portions, and bring <I>the description</I> here to me; and I will
cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.  <a name="C18V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:7</font></a> For the Levites have no portion
among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance: and Gad and
Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.
 <a name="C18V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:8</font></a> The men arose, and went:
and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, Go and
walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will
cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.  <a name="C18V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:9</font></a> The men went and passed through
the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and
they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.  <a name="C18V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:10</font></a> Joshua cast lots for them in
Shiloh before Yahweh: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of
Israel according to their divisions.  <a name="C18V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:11</font></a> The lot of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border
of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of
Joseph.  <a name="C18V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:12</font></a> Their border on
the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side
of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward;
and the goings out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.  <a name="C18V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:13</font></a> The border passed along from
there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Bethel), southward; and the
border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
of Beth Horon the lower.  <a name="C18V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:14</font></a> The border extended
<I>there</I>, and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the
mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it
were at Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children
of Judah: this was the west quarter.  <a name="C18V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:15</font></a> The south quarter was from the
uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim; and the border went out westward, and
went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah;  <a name="C18V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:16</font></a> and the border went down to the
uttermost part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of
Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to
the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down
to En Rogel;  <a name="C18V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:17</font></a> and it
extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth,
which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone
of Bohan the son of Reuben;  <a name="C18V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:18</font></a> and it passed along to the side
over against the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah;  <a name="C18V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:19</font></a> and the border passed along to
the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were
at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was
the south border.  <a name="C18V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:20</font></a> The
Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the
children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their
families.  <a name="C18V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:21</font></a> Now the cities
of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were
Jericho, and Beth Hoglah, and Emek Keziz,  <a name="C18V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:22</font></a> and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim,
and Bethel,  <a name="C18V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:23</font></a> and Avvim,
and Parah, and Ophrah,  <a name="C18V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:24</font></a> and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni,
and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:  <a name="C18V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:25</font></a> Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
 <a name="C18V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:26</font></a> and Mizpeh, and
Chephirah, and Mozah,  <a name="C18V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:27</font></a> and Rekem, and Irpeel, and
Taralah,  <a name="C18V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">18:28</font></a> and Zelah,
Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, <I>and</I>
Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of
the children of Benjamin according to their families.
<p> <a name="C19V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:1</font></a> The second lot came
out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to
their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance
of the children of Judah.  <a name="C19V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:2</font></a> They had for their inheritance
Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,  <a name="C19V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:3</font></a> and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and
Ezem,  <a name="C19V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:4</font></a> and Eltolad, and
Bethul, and Hormah,  <a name="C19V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:5</font></a> and
Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,  <a name="C19V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:6</font></a> and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen;
thirteen cities with their villages:  <a name="C19V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:7</font></a> Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and
Ashan; four cities with their villages:  <a name="C19V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:8</font></a> and all the villages that were
around these cities to Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families.  <a name="C19V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:9</font></a> Out of the part
of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon;
for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore
the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
 <a name="C19V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:10</font></a> The third lot came up
for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of
their inheritance was to Sarid;  <a name="C19V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:11</font></a> and their border went up
westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to
the brook that is before Jokneam;  <a name="C19V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:12</font></a> and it turned from Sarid
eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went
out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;  <a name="C19V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:13</font></a> and from there it passed along
eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which
stretches to Neah;  <a name="C19V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:14</font></a> and
the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out
of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;  <a name="C19V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:15</font></a> and Kattath, and Nahalal, and
Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
 <a name="C19V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:16</font></a> This is the inheritance
of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with
their villages.  <a name="C19V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:17</font></a> The
fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar
according to their families.  <a name="C19V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:18</font></a> Their border was to Jezreel, and
Chesulloth, and Shunem,  <a name="C19V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:19</font></a> and Hapharaim, and Shion, and

Haddah, and Beth Pazzez,  <a name="C19V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:22</font></a> and the border reached to Tabor,
and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh; and the goings out of their border were
at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.  <a name="C19V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:23</font></a> This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities
with their villages.  <a name="C19V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:24</font></a> The
fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to
their families.  <a name="C19V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:25</font></a> Their
border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,  <a name="C19V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:26</font></a> and Allammelech, and Amad, and
Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;  <a name="C19V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:27</font></a> and it turned toward the sunrise
to Beth Dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El
northward to Beth Emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left
hand,  <a name="C19V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:28</font></a> and Ebron, and
Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;  <a name="C19V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:29</font></a> and the border turned to Ramah,
and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the
goings out of it were at the sea by the region of Achzib;  <a name="C19V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:30</font></a> Ummah also, and Aphek, and
Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.  <a name="C19V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:31</font></a> This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities
with their villages.  <a name="C19V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:32</font></a> The
sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of
Naphtali according to their families.  <a name="C19V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:33</font></a> Their border was from Heleph,
from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the
goings out of it were at the Jordan;  <a name="C19V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:34</font></a> and the border turned westward
to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok; and it reached to
Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at
the Jordan toward the sunrise.  <a name="C19V35"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:35</font></a> The fortified cities were
Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,  <a name="C19V36"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:36</font></a> and Adamah, and Ramah, and

Edrei, and En Hazor,  <a name="C19V38"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:38</font></a> Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and
Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.  <a name="C19V39"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:39</font></a> This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities
with their villages.  <a name="C19V40"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:40</font></a> The
seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to
their families.  <a name="C19V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:41</font></a> The
border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,  <a name="C19V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:42</font></a> and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and
Ithlah,  <a name="C19V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:43</font></a> and Elon, and
Timnah, and Ekron,  <a name="C19V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:44</font></a> and
Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,  <a name="C19V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:45</font></a> and Jehud, and Bene Berak, and
Gath Rimmon,  <a name="C19V46"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:46</font></a> and Me
Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.  <a name="C19V47"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:47</font></a> The border of the children of
Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought
against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and
possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of
Dan their father.  <a name="C19V48"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:48</font></a> This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their
families, these cities with their villages.  <a name="C19V49"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:49</font></a> So they made an end of
distributing the land for inheritance by its borders; and the children of
Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
 <a name="C19V50"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:50</font></a> according to the
commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city which he asked, even
Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and
lived therein.  <a name="C19V51"><font size=-1 color="blue">19:51</font></a> These are
the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and
the heads of the fathers' <I>houses</I> of the tribes of the children of
Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the
door of the Tent of Meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
<p> <a name="C20V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:1</font></a> Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying,  <a name="C20V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:2</font></a> Speak to
the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, of which
I spoke to you by Moses,  <a name="C20V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:3</font></a> that the manslayer who kills any
person unwittingly <I>and</I> unawares may flee there: and they shall be
to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.  <a name="C20V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:4</font></a> He shall flee to one of those
cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and
declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell
among them.  <a name="C20V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:5</font></a> If the
avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the
manslayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unawares, and
didn't hate him before.  <a name="C20V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:6</font></a> He shall dwell in that city,
until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of
the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer
return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from
whence he fled.  <a name="C20V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:7</font></a> They set
apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in
the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron) in the
hill country of Judah.  <a name="C20V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:8</font></a> Beyond the Jordan at Jericho
eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the
tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.  <a name="C20V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">20:9</font></a> These were the appointed cities
for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among
them, that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there, and not
die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the
congregation.
<p> <a name="C21V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:1</font></a> Then came near the
heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and
to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers' <I>houses</I> of
the tribes of the children of Israel;  <a name="C21V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:2</font></a> and they spoke to them at Shiloh
in the land of Canaan, saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to
dwell in, with its suburbs for our livestock.  <a name="C21V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:3</font></a> The children of Israel gave to
the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of
Yahweh, these cities with their suburbs.  <a name="C21V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:4</font></a> The lot came out for the families
of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the
Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the
Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.  <a name="C21V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:5</font></a> The rest of the children of
Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of
the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
 <a name="C21V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:6</font></a> The children of Gershon
had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the
tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the
half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.  <a name="C21V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:7</font></a> The children of Merari according
to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of
Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.  <a name="C21V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:8</font></a> The children of Israel gave by
lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by
Moses.  <a name="C21V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:9</font></a> They gave out of
the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children
of Simeon, these cities which are <I>here</I> mentioned by name:  <a name="C21V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:10</font></a> and they were for the children
of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of
Levi; for theirs was the first lot.  <a name="C21V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:11</font></a> They gave them Kiriath Arba,
<I>which Arba was</I> the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill
country of Judah, with its suburbs around it.  <a name="C21V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:12</font></a> But the fields of the city, and
its villages, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
 <a name="C21V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:13</font></a> To the children of Aaron
the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the

of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of
the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.  <a name="C21V41"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:41</font></a> All the cities of the Levites in
the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight
cities with their suburbs.  <a name="C21V42"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:42</font></a> These cities were every one with
their suburbs around them: thus it was with all these cities.  <a name="C21V43"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:43</font></a> So Yahweh gave to Israel all the
land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and
lived therein.  <a name="C21V44"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:44</font></a> Yahweh
gave them rest all around, according to all that he swore to their
fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them;
Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand.  <a name="C21V45"><font size=-1 color="blue">21:45</font></a> There failed not anything of any
good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to
pass.
<p> <a name="C22V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:1</font></a> Then Joshua called the
Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,  <a name="C22V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:2</font></a> and said to them, You have kept
all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to
my voice in all that I commanded you:  <a name="C22V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:3</font></a> you have not left your brothers
these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the
commandment of Yahweh your God.  <a name="C22V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:4</font></a> Now Yahweh your God has given
rest to your brothers, as he spoke to them: therefore now turn you, and
get you to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the
servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.  <a name="C22V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:5</font></a> Only take diligent heed to do the
commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you,
to love Yahweh your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart
and with all your soul.  <a name="C22V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:6</font></a> So Joshua blessed them, and sent
them away; and they went to their tents.  <a name="C22V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:7</font></a> Now to the one half-tribe of
Manasseh Moses had given <I>inheritance</I> in Bashan; but to the other
half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward; moreover
when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,  <a name="C22V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:8</font></a> and spoke to them, saying, Return
with much wealth to your tents, and with very much livestock, with silver,
and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:
divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.  <a name="C22V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:9</font></a> The children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from
the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to
go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they
owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.  <a name="C22V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:10</font></a> When they came to the region
about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an
altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look on.  <a name="C22V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:11</font></a> The children of Israel heard
say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of
Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to the
children of Israel.  <a name="C22V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:12</font></a> When
the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children
of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to
war.  <a name="C22V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:13</font></a> The children of
Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to
the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of
Eleazar the priest,  <a name="C22V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:14</font></a> and
with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the
tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers'
houses among the thousands of Israel.  <a name="C22V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:15</font></a> They came to the children of
Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to
the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,  <a name="C22V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:16</font></a> Thus says the whole congregation
of Yahweh, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God
of Israel, to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you have
built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?  <a name="C22V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:17</font></a> Is the iniquity of Peor too
little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day,
although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,  <a name="C22V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:18</font></a> that you must turn away this day
from following Yahweh? and it will be, seeing you rebel today against
Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of
Israel.  <a name="C22V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:19</font></a> However, if the
land of your possession be unclean, then pass over to the land of the
possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession
among us: but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in
building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.  <a name="C22V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:20</font></a> Didn't Achan the son of Zerah
commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the
congregation of Israel? and that man didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
 <a name="C22V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:21</font></a> Then the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered,
and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,  <a name="C22V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:22</font></a> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the
Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel he shall know: if it be in
rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),
 <a name="C22V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:23</font></a> that we have built us an
altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer thereon burnt
offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings
thereon, let Yahweh himself require it;  <a name="C22V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:24</font></a> and if we have not <I>rather</I>
out of carefulness done this, <I>and</I> of purpose, saying, In time to
come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to
do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?  <a name="C22V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:25</font></a> for Yahweh has made the Jordan a
border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you
have no portion in Yahweh: so might your children make our children cease
from fearing Yahweh.  <a name="C22V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:26</font></a> Therefore we said, Let us now
prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
 <a name="C22V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:27</font></a> but it shall be a
witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we
may do the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, and with
our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not
tell our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.  <a name="C22V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:28</font></a> Therefore said we, It shall be,
when they so tell us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall
say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made,
not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us
and you.  <a name="C22V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:29</font></a> Far be it from
us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from
following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering,
or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his
tent.  <a name="C22V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:30</font></a> When Phinehas the
priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the
thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it
pleased them well.  <a name="C22V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:31</font></a> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to
the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of
us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh: now have
you delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.  <a name="C22V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:32</font></a> Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from
the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to
the children of Israel, and brought them word again.  <a name="C22V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:33</font></a> The thing pleased the children
of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of
going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad lived.  <a name="C22V34"><font size=-1 color="blue">22:34</font></a> The children of Reuben and the
children of Gad called the altar <I>Ed</I>: For, <I>said they</I>, it is a
witness between us that Yahweh is God.
<p> <a name="C23V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:1</font></a> It happened after many
days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around,
and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;  <a name="C23V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:2</font></a> that Joshua called for all
Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for
their officers, and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:
 <a name="C23V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:3</font></a> and you have seen all
that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you; for
Yahweh your God, he it is that has fought for you.  <a name="C23V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:4</font></a> Behold, I have allotted to you
these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the
Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea
toward the going down of the sun.  <a name="C23V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:5</font></a> Yahweh your God, he will thrust
them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you
shall possess their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.  <a name="C23V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:6</font></a> Therefore be you very courageous
to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses,
that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left;  <a name="C23V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:7</font></a> that you not come among these
nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of
their gods, nor cause to swear <I>by them</I>, neither serve them, nor bow
down yourselves to them;  <a name="C23V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:8</font></a> but cleave to Yahweh your God, as
you have done to this day.  <a name="C23V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:9</font></a> For Yahweh has driven out from
before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man has stood
before you to this day.  <a name="C23V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:10</font></a> One man of you shall chase a
thousand; for Yahweh your God, he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to
you.  <a name="C23V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:11</font></a> Take good heed
therefore to yourselves, that you love Yahweh your God.  <a name="C23V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:12</font></a> Else if you do at all go back,
and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even these who remain among
you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
 <a name="C23V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:13</font></a> know for a certainty
that Yahweh your God will no more drive these nations from out of your
sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your
sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land
which Yahweh your God has given you.  <a name="C23V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:14</font></a> Behold, this day I am going the
way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your
souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Yahweh
your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you, not one thing has
failed of it.  <a name="C23V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:15</font></a> It shall
happen, that as all the good things are come on you of which Yahweh your
God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring on you all the evil things, until
he have destroyed you from off this good land which Yahweh your God has
given you.  <a name="C23V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">23:16</font></a> When you
disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you, and go
and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger
of Yahweh be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off
the good land which he has given to you.
<p> <a name="C24V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:1</font></a> Joshua gathered all
the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and
for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they
presented themselves before God.  <a name="C24V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:2</font></a> Joshua said to all the people,
Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond
the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and
they served other gods.  <a name="C24V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:3</font></a> I
took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all
the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.  <a name="C24V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:4</font></a> I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:
and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children
went down into Egypt.  <a name="C24V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:5</font></a> I
sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did
in its midst: and afterward I brought you out.  <a name="C24V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:6</font></a> I brought your fathers out of
Egypt: and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your
fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the <a href="#N4">Red Sea</a>.
 <a name="C24V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:7</font></a> When they cried out to
Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea
on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you
lived in the wilderness many days.  <a name="C24V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:8</font></a> I brought you into the land of
the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and
I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed
them from before you.  <a name="C24V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:9</font></a> Then Balak the son of Zippor,
king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called
Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;  <a name="C24V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:10</font></a> but I would not listen to
Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his
hand.  <a name="C24V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:11</font></a> You went over the
Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you,
the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and
the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into
your hand.  <a name="C24V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:12</font></a> I sent the
hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two
kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.  <a name="C24V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:13</font></a> I gave you a land whereon you
had not labored, and cities which you didn't build, and you dwell therein;
of vineyards and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.  <a name="C24V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:14</font></a> Now therefore fear Yahweh, and
serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your
fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.
 <a name="C24V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:15</font></a> If it seem evil to you
to serve Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods
which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the
Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will
serve Yahweh.  <a name="C24V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:16</font></a> The people
answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other
gods;  <a name="C24V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:17</font></a> for Yahweh our
God, he it is who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt,
from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and
preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples
through the midst of whom we passed;  <a name="C24V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:18</font></a> and Yahweh drove out from before
us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land: therefore we
also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.  <a name="C24V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:19</font></a> Joshua said to the people, You
can't serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not
forgive your disobedience nor your sins.  <a name="C24V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:20</font></a> If you forsake Yahweh, and serve
foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after
that he has done you good.  <a name="C24V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:21</font></a> The people said to Joshua, No;
but we will serve Yahweh.  <a name="C24V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:22</font></a> Joshua said to the people, You
are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve
him. They said, We are witnesses.  <a name="C24V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:23</font></a> Now therefore put away, <I>said
he</I>, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to
Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <a name="C24V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:24</font></a> The people said to Joshua,
Yahweh our God will we serve, and to his voice will we listen.  <a name="C24V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:25</font></a> So Joshua made a covenant with
the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
 <a name="C24V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:26</font></a> Joshua wrote these words
in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up
there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.  <a name="C24V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:27</font></a> Joshua said to all the people,
Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the
words of Yahweh which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness
against you, lest you deny your God.  <a name="C24V28"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:28</font></a> So Joshua sent the people away,
every man to his inheritance.  <a name="C24V29"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:29</font></a> It happened after these things,
that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred
ten years old.  <a name="C24V30"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:30</font></a> They
buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in
the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
 <a name="C24V31"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:31</font></a> Israel served Yahweh all
the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua,
and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
 <a name="C24V32"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:32</font></a> The bones of Joseph,
which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in
Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor
the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the
inheritance of the children of Joseph.  <a name="C24V33"><font size=-1 color="blue">24:33</font></a> Eleazar the son of Aaron died;
and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him
in the hill country of Ephraim.

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,<br>
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,<br>
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,<br>
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New<br>
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,<br>
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

<p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>

method other than by check or money order.</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are<br>
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising<br>

made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.</p>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
