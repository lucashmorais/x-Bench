<h1 align="center">CHAPTER I</h1>

<h2 align="center">&#8220;While the Heart Beats Young&#8221;</h2>

<p align="left">The scorching heat of a midsummer
day beat mercilessly upon the earth. Travelers on
the dusty roads, toilers in the fields, and others
exposed to the rays of the sun, thought yearningly
of cooling winds and running streams. They would have
looked with envy upon the scene being enacted in one
of the small streams of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
There a little red-haired girl, barefooted, her short
gingham skirt tucked up unevenly here and there, was
wading in the cool, shallow waters of a creek that
was tree-bordered and willow-arched. Her clear, rippling
laughter of sheer joy broke through the Sabbatical
calm of that quiet spot and echoed up and down the
meadow as she splashed about in the brook.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; she said aloud,
&#8220;this here&#8217;s the best fun! Abody wouldn&#8217;t
hardly know it&#8217;s so powerful hot out to-day.
All these trees round the crick makes it cool. I like
wadin&#8217; and pickin&#8217; up the pebbles, some
of &#8217;em washed round and smooth like little white
soup beans--ach, I got to watch me,&#8221; she exclaimed,
laughing, as she made a quick movement to retain her
equilibrium. &#8220;The big stones are slippery from
bein&#8217; in the water. Next I know I&#8217;ll sit
right down in the crick. Then wouldn&#8217;t Phil
be ready to laugh at me! It wonders me now where he
is. I wish he&#8217;d come once and we&#8217;d have
some fun.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As if in answer to her wish a boyish
whistle rang out, followed by a long-drawn &#8220;Oo-oh,
Manda, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here. Wadin&#8217; in the crick,&#8221; she
called. &#8220;Come on in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She splashed gleefully about as her
brother came into sight and walked with mock dignity
through the meadow to the stream. He held his red-crowned
head high and sang teasingly, &#8220;Manda, Manda,
red-headed Manda; tee-legged, toe-legged, bow-legged
Manda!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Philip Reist,&#8221; she shouted
crossly, &#8220;I am not! My legs are straighter&#8217;n
yours! You dare, you just dare once, to come in the
crick and say that and see what you get!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Although two years her junior he accepted
the challenge and repeated the doggerel as he planted
his bare feet in the water. She splashed him and he
retaliated, but the boy, though smaller, was agile,
and in an unguarded moment he caught the girl by the
wrists and pushed her so she sat squarely in the shallow
waters of the brook.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hey, smarty,&#8221; he exulted
impishly as he held her there, &#8220;you will get
fresh with me, you will, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, let me up, leave me go, I&#8217;m all
wet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, how did that happen, I
wonder. My goodness, what will Mamma say?&#8221; he
teased.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Phil,&#8221; the girl half
coaxed, but he read a desire for revenge in her face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Jiminy Christmas, don&#8217;t
cry.&#8221; He puckered up his lips in imitation of
a whimpering girl. &#8220;Got enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; the word rang crossly, &#8220;you
let me be now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, cry baby.&#8221;
He loosened his hold on her wrists. &#8220;But because
you&#8217;re such a fraid cat I&#8217;ll not give you
what I brought for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; The girl
scrambled to her feet, curiosity helping her to forget
momentarily the boy&#8217;s tricks. &#8220;What did
you bring me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Something that&#8217;s little
and almost round and blue and I got it in a tree.
Now if you&#8217;re not a blockhead mebbe you can guess
what it is.&#8221; He moved his hand about in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, let me see.&#8221; The words were plain
coaxing then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221; And he drew from his pocket a
robin&#8217;s egg.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Philip Reist! Where did you
get that?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice was stern and
loud.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I found the dandiest nest
out on one of the cherry trees and I know you like
dinky birds and thought I&#8217;d get you an egg. There&#8217;s
three more in the nest; I guess that&#8217;s enough
for any robin. Anyhow, they had young ones in that
nest early in the summer.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You bad boy! How dare you rob
a bird&#8217;s nest? God will punish you for that!&#8221;
Her eyes blazed with wrath at the thoughtless deed
of the lad.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; he answered boldly,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the use fussin&#8217; &#8217;bout
a dinky bird&#8217;s egg? You make me sick, Manda.
Cry about it now! Oh, the poor little birdie lost
its egg,&#8221; he whined in falsetto voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You--you--I guess I won&#8217;t
wait for God to punish you, Philip Reist.&#8221; With
the words she grabbed and sat him in the water. &#8220;You
need something <i>right now</i> to make you remember
not to take eggs from nests. And here it is! When
you want to do it after this just think of the day
I sat you down in the crick. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to tell Mom on you, too, that&#8217;s what I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, tattle-tale, girls are all tattle-tales!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struggled to escape but the hold of his sister
was vise-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave nests alone?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ah, who wants to steal eggs?
I just brought you one &#8217;cause I thought you&#8217;d
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t. So let
the eggs where they belong,&#8221; she said as she
relaxed her clasp and he rose.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now look at us,&#8221; he began,
then the funny spectacle of wet clothes sent each
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; he said, &#8220;won&#8217;t we
get Sam Hill from Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s Sam Hill?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;And where do you learn such awful
slang? Abody can hardly understand you half the time.
Mom says you should stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yea, that reminds me, Manda,
what I come for. Mom said you&#8217;re to come in
and get your dresses tried on. And mebbe you&#8217;d
like to know that Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s here again.
She just come and is helpin&#8217; to sew and if she
sees our clothes wet--oh, yea!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh yea,&#8221; echoed Amanda
with the innocent candor of a twelve-year-old. &#8220;Aunt
Rebecca--is she here again? Ach, if she wasn&#8217;t
so cranky I&#8217;d be glad still when she comes,
but you know how she acts all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um-uh. Uncle Amos says still
she&#8217;s prickly like a chestnut burr. Jiminy crickets,
she&#8217;s worse&#8217;n any burr I ever seen!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; the girl said
thoughtfully, &#8220;but chestnut burrs are like velvet
inside. Mebbe she&#8217;d be nice inside if only abody
had the dare to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, come on,&#8221; urged
the boy, impatient at the girl&#8217;s philosophy.
&#8220;Mom wants you to fit. Come on, get pins stuck
in you and then I&#8217;ll laugh. Gee, I&#8217;m glad
I&#8217;m not a girl! Fittin&#8217; dresses on a day
like this--whew! "</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; she tossed her
red head proudly, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m one!&#8221;
A sudden thought came to her--"Come in, Phil, while
I fit and then we&#8217;ll set in the kitchen and
count how often Aunt Rebecca says, My goodness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um-uh,&#8221; he agreed readily,
&#8220;come on, Manda. That&#8217;ll be peachy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The children laughed in anticipation
of a good time as they ran through the hot sun of
the pasture lot, up the narrow path along the cornfield
fence and into the back yard of their home.</p>

<p align="left">The Reist farm with its fine orchards
and great fields of grain was manifestly the home
of prosperous, industrious farmers. From its big gardens
were gathered choice vegetables to be sold in the famous
markets of Lancaster, five miles distant. The farmhouse,
a big square brick building of old-fashioned design,
was located upon a slight elevation and commanded
from its wide front porch a panoramic view of a large
section of the beautiful Garden Spot of America.</p>

<p align="left">The household consisted of Mrs. Reist,
a widow, her two children, her brother Amos Rohrer,
who was responsible for the success of the farm, and
a hired girl, Millie Hess, who had served the household
so long and faithfully that she seemed an integral
part of the family.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist was a sweet-faced, frail
little woman, a member of the Mennonite Church. She
wore the plain garb adopted by the women of that sect--the
tight-fitting waist covered by a pointed shoulder cape,
the full skirt and the white cap upon smoothly combed,
parted hair. Her red-haired children were so like
their father had been, that at times her heart contracted
at sight of them. His had been a strong, buoyant spirit
and when her hands, like Moses&#8217; of old, had required
steadying, he had never failed her. At first his death
left her helpless and discouraged as she faced the
task of rearing without his help the two young children,
children about whom they had dreamed great dreams and
for whom they had planned wonderful things. But gradually
the widowed mother developed new courage, and though
frail in body grew brave in spirit and faced cheerfully
the rearing of Amanda and Philip.</p>

<p align="left">The children had inherited the father&#8217;s
strength, his happy cheerfulness, his quick-to-anger
and quicker-to-repent propensity, but the mother&#8217;s
gentleness also dwelt in them. Laughing, merry, they
sang their way through the days, protesting vehemently
when things went contrary to their desires, but laughing
the next moment in the irresponsible manner of youth
the world over. That August day the promise of fun
at Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s expense quite compensated for
the unpleasantness of her visit.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca Miller was an elder sister
to Mrs. Reist, so said the inscription in the big
family Bible. But it was difficult to understand how
the two women could have been mothered by one person.</p>

<p align="left">Millie, the hired girl, expressed
her opinion freely to Amanda one day after a particularly
trying time with the old woman. &#8220;How that Rebecca
Miller can be your mom&#8217;s sister now beats me.
She&#8217;s more like a wasp than anything I ever
seen without wings. It&#8217;s sting, sting all the
time with her; nothin&#8217; anybody does or says
is just right. She&#8217;s faultfindin&#8217; every
time she comes. It wonders me sometimes if she&#8217;ll
like heaven when she gets up there, or if she&#8217;ll
see some things she&#8217;d change if she had her
way. And mostly all the plain people are so nice that
abody&#8217;s got to like &#8217;em, but she&#8217;s
not like the others, I guess. Most every time she
comes she makes me mad. She&#8217;s too bossy. Why,
to-day when I was fryin&#8217; doughnuts she bothered
me so that I just wished the fat would spritz her
good once and she&#8217;d go and leave me be.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">It will be seen that Millie felt free
to voice her opinions at all times in the Reist family.
She was a plain-faced, stout little woman of thirty-five,
a product of the Pennsylvania Dutch country. Orphaned
at an early age she had been buffeted about sorely
until the happy day she entered the Reist household.
Their kindness to her won her heart and she repaid
them by a staunch devotion. The Reist joys, sorrows,
perplexities and anxieties were shared by her and she
naturally came in for a portion of Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s
faultfinding.</p>

<p align="left">Cross-grained and trying, Rebecca
Miller was unlike the majority of the plain, unpretentious
people of that rural community. In all her years she
had failed to appreciate the futility of fuss, the
sin of useless worry, and had never learned the invaluable
lesson of minding her own business. &#8220;She means
well,&#8221; Mrs. Reist said in conciliatory tones
when Uncle Amos or the children resented the interference
of the dictatorial relative, but secretly she wondered
how Rebecca could be so--so--she never finished the
sentence.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, my goodness, here she
comes once!&#8221; Amanda heard her aunt&#8217;s rasping
voice as they entered the house.</p>

<p align="left">Stifling an &#8220;Oh yea&#8221; the
girl walked into the sitting-room.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello, Aunt Rebecca,&#8221;
she said dutifully, then turned to her mother-- &#8220;You
want me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, your dress is
all wet in the back!&#8221; Aunt Rebecca said shrilly.
&#8220;What in the world did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Before she could reply Philip turned
about so his wet clothes were on view. &#8220;And
you too!&#8221; cried the visitor. &#8220;My goodness,
what was you two up to? Such wet blotches like you
got!&#8221; &#8220;We were wadin&#8217; in the crick,&#8221;
Amanda said demurely, as her mother smoothed the tousled
red hair back from the flushed forehead.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness! Wadin&#8217; in
the crick in dog days!&#8221; exploded Aunt Rebecca.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now for that she&#8217;ll turn
into a doggie, ain&#8217;t, Mom?&#8221; said the boy
roguishly.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca looked over her steel-rimmed
spectacles at the two children who were bubbling over
with laughter. &#8220;I think,&#8221; she said sternly,
&#8220;people don&#8217;t learn children no manners
no more.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; the mother said
soothingly, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t mind them. They
get so full of laughin&#8217; even when we don&#8217;t
see what&#8217;s to laugh at.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Amanda,
&#8220;the Bible says it&#8217;s good to have a merry
heart and me and Phil&#8217;s got one. You like us
that way, don&#8217;t you, Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the mother agreed.
&#8220;Now you go put on dry things, then I want to
fit your dresses. And, Philip, are you wet through?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Naw. These thick pants don&#8217;t
get wet through if I rutch in water an hour. Jiminy
pats, Mom, girls are delicate, can&#8217;t stand a
little wettin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You just wait, Phil,&#8221;
Amanda called to him as she ran up-stairs, &#8220;you&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; some good wettin&#8217; yet. I ain&#8217;t
done with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cracky, who&#8217;s afraid?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>A little later the girl appeared in dry clothes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
forgot to wash my hands. I better go out to the pump
and clean &#8217;em so I don&#8217;t get my new dresses
dirty right aways.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She ran to the pump on the side porch
and jerked the handle up and down, while her brother
followed and watched her, defiance in his eyes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said suddenly,
&#8220;if you want it I&#8217;ll give it to you now.&#8221;
With that she caught him and soused his head in the
tin basin that stood in the trough. &#8220;One for
duckin&#8217; me in the crick, and another for stealin&#8217;
that bird&#8217;s egg, and a third to learn you some
sense.&#8221; Before he could get his breath she had
run into the house and stood before her mother ready
for the fitting. &#8220;I like this goods, Mom,&#8221;
she told the mother as the new dress was slipped over
her head. &#8220;I think the brown goes good with
my red hair, and the blue gingham is pretty, too. Only
don&#8217;t never buy me no pink nor red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Not unless your hair turns brown.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, but you spoil
her,&#8221; came the unsolicited opinion of Aunt Rebecca.
&#8220;When I was little I wore what my mom bought
me, and so did you. We would never thought of sayin&#8217;,
&#8216;Don&#8217;t get me this or that.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But with red hair it&#8217;s
different. And as long as blue and brown and colors
Amanda likes don&#8217;t cost more than those she don&#8217;t
want I can&#8217;t see why she shouldn&#8217;t have
what she wants.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, abody wonders what kind
o&#8217; children plain people expect to raise nowadays
with such caterin&#8217; to their vanity.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist bit her lips and refrained
from answering. The expression of joy on the face
of Amanda as she looked down at her new dress took
away the sting of the older woman&#8217;s words. &#8220;I
want,&#8221; the mother said softly, &#8220;I want
my children to have a happy childhood. It belongs to
them. And I want them to remember me for a kind mom.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Mom, you <i>are</i> a
good mom.&#8221; Amanda leaned over the mother, who
was pinning the hem in the new dress, and pressed a
kiss on the top of the white-capped head. &#8220;When
I grow up I want to be like you. And when I&#8217;m
big and you&#8217;re old, won&#8217;t you be the nicest
granny!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca suddenly looked sad and
meek. Perhaps a partial appreciation of what she missed
by being childless came to her. What thrills she might
have known if happy children ran to her with shouts
of &#8220;Granny!&#8221; But she did not carry the
thread of thought far enough to analyze her own actions
and discover that, though childless, she could attract
the love of other people&#8217;s children if she chose.
The tender moment was fleet. She looked at Amanda
and Philip and saw in them only two children prone
to evil, requiring stern disciplining.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now don&#8217;t go far from
the house,&#8221; said Mrs. Reist later, &#8220;for
your other dress is soon ready to fit. As soon as
Aunt Rebecca gets the pleats basted in the skirt.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon get them in.
But it&#8217;s foolishness to go to all that bother
when gathers would do just as good and go faster.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda turned away and a moment later
she and Phil were seated on the long wooden settee
in the kitchen. The boy had silently agreed to a temporary
truce so that the game of counting might be played.
He would pay back his sister some other time. Gee,
it was easy to get her goat-- just a little thing
like a caterpillar dropped down her neck would make
her holler!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Gee, Manda, I thought of a
bully thing!&#8221; the boy whispered. &#8220;If that
old crosspatch Rebecca says &#8216;My goodness&#8217;
thirty times till four o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll fetch
a tobacco worm and put it in her bonnet. If she don&#8217;t
say it that often you got to put one in. Huh? Manda,
ain&#8217;t that a peachy game to play?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed the
girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get paper and pencil to keep
count.&#8221; She slipped into the other room and in
a few minutes the two settled themselves on the settee,
their ears straining to hear every word spoken by
the women in the next room.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, this thread breaks
easy! They don&#8217;t make nothin&#8217; no more
like they used to,&#8221; came through the open door.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s one,&#8221; said
Phil; &#8220;make a stroke on the paper. Jiminy Christmas,
that&#8217;s easy! Bet you we get that paper full of
strokes!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, that girl&#8217;s
shootin&#8217; up! It wouldn&#8217;t wonder me if you
got to leave these dresses down till time for school.
Now if I was you I&#8217;d make them plenty big and
let her grow into &#8217;em. Our mom always done that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">And so the conversation went on until
there were twenty lines on the paper. The game was
growing exciting and, under the stress of it, the
counting on the old settee rose above the discreet
whisper it was originally meant to be. &#8220;Twenty-one!&#8221;
cried Amanda. Aunt Rebecca walked to the door.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s you two up to?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;Oh, you got the hymn-book. My goodness,
what for you writin&#8217; on the hymn-book?&#8221;
She turned to her sister. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217;
to make &#8217;em stop that? A hymn-book ain&#8217;t
to be wrote on!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Twenty-two,&#8221; cried Phil,
secure in the knowledge that his mother would not
object to their use of the book and safely confident
that the aunt could not dream what they were doing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What is twenty-two? Look once,
Amanda,&#8221; said the woman, taking the mention
of the number to refer to a hymn.</p>

<p align="left">The girl opened the book. &#8220;Beulah
Land,&#8221; she read, a sudden compunction seizing
her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yes, Beulah Land--I sang
that when I was a girl still. My goodness, abody gets
old quick.&#8221; She sighed and returned to her sewing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Twenty-three, countin&#8217;
the last one,&#8221; prompted Phil. &#8220;Mark it
down. Gee, it&#8217;s a cinch.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But Amanda looked sober. &#8220;Phil,
mebbe it ain&#8217;t right to make fun of her so and
count after how often she says the same thing. She
looked kinda teary when she said that about gettin&#8217;
old quick.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, go on,&#8221; said Philip,
too young to appreciate the subtle shades of feelings
or looks. &#8220;You can&#8217;t back out of it now.
Gee, what&#8217;s bitin&#8217; you? It ain&#8217;t
four o&#8217;clock yet, and it ain&#8217;t right, neither,
to go back on a promise. Anyhow, if we don&#8217;t
go on and count up to thirty you got to put the worm
in her bonnet--you said you would--girls are no good,
they get cold feet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Thus spurred, Amanda resumed the game
until the coveted thirty lines were marked on the
paper. Then, the goal reached, it was Phil&#8217;s
duty to find a tobacco worm.</p>

<p align="left">Supper at the Reist farmhouse was
an ample meal. By that time the hardest portion of
the day&#8217;s labor was completed and the relaxation
from physical toil made the meal doubly enjoyable.
Millie saw to it that there was always appetizing
food set upon the big square table in the kitchen.
Two open doors and three screened windows looking out
upon green fields and orchards made the kitchen a
cool refuge that hot August day.</p>

<p align="left">Uncle Amos, a fat, flushed little
man, upon whose shoulders rested the responsibilities
of that big farm, sat at the head of the table. His
tired figure sagged somewhat, but his tanned face shone
from a vigorous scrubbing. Millie sat beside Mrs.
Reist, for she was, as she expressed it, &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s
dog, to eat alone.&#8221; She expected to eat with
the folks where she hired. However, her presence at
the table did not prevent her from waiting on the
others. She made frequent trips to the other side
of the big kitchen to replenish any of the depleted
dishes.</p>

<p>That evening Amanda and Philip were restless.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What ails you two?&#8221; demanded
Millie. &#8220;Bet you&#8217;re up to some tricks
again, by the gigglin&#8217; of you and the rutchin&#8217;
around you&#8217;re doin&#8217;! I just bet you&#8217;re
up to something,&#8221; she grumbled, but her eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Nothin&#8217; ails us,&#8221;
declared Phil. &#8220;We just feel like laughin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; said Aunt Rebecca,
&#8220;this dumb laughin&#8217; is all for nothin&#8217;.
Anyhow, you better not laugh too much, for you got
to cry as much as you laugh before you die.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to cry
oceans!&#8221; Amanda admitted. &#8220;There&#8217;ll
be another Niagara Falls, right here in Lancaster
County, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;that&#8217;s
just another of them old superstitions.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Aunt Rebecca said
solemnly, &#8220;nobody believes them no more. But
it&#8217;s a lot of truth in &#8217;em just the same.
I often took notice that as high as the spiders build
their webs in August so high will the snow be that
winter. Nowadays people don&#8217;t study the almanac
or look for signs. Young ones is by far too smart.
The farmers plant their seeds any time now, beans
and peas in the Posey Woman sign and then they wonder
why they get only flowers &#8217;stead of peas and
beans. They take up red beets in the wrong sign and
wonder why the beets cook up stringy. The women make
sauerkraut in Gallas week and wonder why it&#8217;s
bitter. I could tell them what&#8217;s the matter!
There&#8217;s more to them old women&#8217;s signs
than most people know. I never yet heard a dog cry
at night that I didn&#8217;t hear of some one I know
dyin&#8217; soon after. I wouldn&#8217;t open an umbrella
in the house for ten dollars--it&#8217;s bad luck--yes,
you laugh,&#8221; she said accusingly to Philip. &#8220;But
you got lots to learn yet. My goodness, when I think
of all I learned since I was as old as you! Of all
the new things in the world! I guess till you&#8217;re
as old as I am there&#8217;ll be lots more.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Sure Mike,&#8221; said the
boy, rather flippantly. &#8220;What&#8217;s all new
since you was little?&#8221; he asked his aunt.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Telephone, them talkin&#8217;
machines, sewin&#8217; machines--anyhow, they were
mighty scarce then--trolleys----&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Automobiles?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, yes! Them awful
things! They scare the life out abody. I don&#8217;t
go in none and I don&#8217;t want no automobile hearse
to haul me, neither. I&#8217;d be afraid it&#8217;d
run off.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Great horn spoon, Aunt Rebecca,
but that would be a gay ride,&#8221; the boy said,
while Amanda giggled and Uncle Amos winked to Millie,
who made a hurried trip to the stove for coffee.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; came the aunt&#8217;s
rebuke. &#8220;You talk too much of that slang stuff.
I guess I&#8217;ll take the next trolley home,&#8221;
she said, unconscious of the merriment she had caused.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to help with the dishes, but
I want to get home before it gets so late for me.
Anyhow, Amanda is big enough to help. When I was big
as her I cooked and baked and worked like a woman.
Why, when I was just a little thing, Mom&#8217;d tell
me to go in the front room and pick the snipples off
the floor and I&#8217;d get down and do it. Nobody
does that now, neither. They run a sweeper over the
carpets and wear &#8217;em out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the floors are full of germs,&#8221; said
Amanda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cherms--what are them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, dreadful things! I learned
about them at school. They are little, crawly bugs
with a lot of legs, and if you eat them or breathe
them in you&#8217;ll get scarlet fever or diphtheria.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, that&#8217;s too dumb!&#8221;
Aunt Rebecca was unimpressed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe in no such things.&#8221; With that emphatic
remark she stalked to the sitting-room for her bonnet.
She met Phil coming out, his hands in his pockets.
He paused in the doorway as Amanda and her mother joined
the guest.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca lifted the black silk
bonnet carefully from the little table and Amanda
shifted nervously from one foot to the other. If only
Aunt Rebecca wouldn&#8217;t hold the bonnet so the
worm would fall to the floor! Then the woman gave
the stiff headgear a dexterous turn and the squirming
thing landed on her head.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness! My goodness!&#8221;
she cried as something soft brushed her cheek. Intently
inquisitive, she stooped and picked from the floor
a fat, green, wriggling tobacco worm.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;One of them cherms, I guess,
Amanda, ain&#8217;t?&#8221; she said as she looked
keenly at the child.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda blushed and was silent. Philip
was unable to hide his guilt. &#8220;Now, when did
tobacco worms learn to live in bonnets?&#8221; she
asked the boy as she eyed him reproachfully.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist looked hurt. Her gentle
reproof, &#8220;Children, I&#8217;m ashamed of you!&#8221;
cut deeper with Amanda than the scolding of Aunt Rebecca--"You&#8217;re
a bad pair! Almost you spoiled me my good bonnet. If
I&#8217;d squeezed that worm on my cap it would have
ruined it! My goodness, you both need a good spankin&#8217;,
that&#8217;s what. Too bad you ain&#8217;t got a pop
to learn you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It was only for fun, Aunt Rebecca,&#8221;
said Amanda, truly ashamed. But Phil put his hand
over his mouth to hide a grin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Fun--what for fun is that--to
be so disrespectful to an old aunt? And you, Philip,
ain&#8217;t one bit ashamed. Your mom just ought to
make you hunt all the worms in the whole tobacco patch.
My goodness, look at that clock! Next with this dumb
foolin&#8217; I&#8217;ll miss that trolley yet. I
must hurry myself now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Aunt Rebecca,&#8221;
Amanda said softly, eager to make peace with the woman,
whom she knew to be kind, though a bit severe.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I don&#8217;t hold no
spite. But I think it&#8217;s high time you learn to
behave. Such a big girl like you ought to help her
brother be good, not learn him tricks. Boys go to
the bad soon enough. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; now,&#8221;
she addressed Mrs. Reist, &#8220;and you let me know
when you boil apple butter and I&#8217;ll come and
help stir.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, Rebecca. I hope
the children will behave and not cut up like to-day.
You are always so ready to help us--I can&#8217;t understand
why they did such a thing. I&#8217;m ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, it&#8217;s all right,
long as my bonnet ain&#8217;t spoiled. If that had
happened then there&#8217;d be a different kind o&#8217;
bird pipin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After she left Philip proceeded to
do a Comanche Indian dance--in which Amanda joined
by being pulled around the room by her dress skirt--in
undisguised hilarity over the departure of their grim
relative. Boys have little understanding of the older
person who suppresses their animal energy and skylarking
happiness.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I ain&#8217;t had so much fun
since Adam was a boy,&#8221; Philip admitted with
pretended seriousness, while the family smiled at his
drollness.</p>

<a name="ch2"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER II</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Snitzing Party</h2>

<p align="left">Apple-butter boiling on the Reist
farm occurred frequently during August and September.
The choice fruit of the orchard was sold at Lancaster
market, but bushels of smaller, imperfect apples lay
scattered about the ground, and these were salvaged
for the fragrant and luscious apple butter. To Phil
and Amanda fell the task of gathering the fruit from
the grass, washing them in big wooden tubs near the
pump and placing them in bags. Then Uncle Amos hauled
the apples to the cider press, where they came forth
like liquid amber that dripped into fat brown barrels.</p>

<p align="left">Many pecks of pared fruit were required
for the apple-butter boiling. These were pared--the
Pennsylvania Dutch say snitzed--the night before the
day of boiling.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mom,&#8221; Amanda told her
mother as they ate supper one night when many apples
were to be pared for the next day&#8217;s use, &#8220;Lyman
Mertzheimer seen us pick apples to-day and he said
he&#8217;s comin&#8217; over to-night to the snitzin&#8217;
party--d&#8217;you care?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Let him come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So,&#8221; teased Uncle Amos.
&#8220;Guess in a few years, Manda, you&#8217;ll be
havin&#8217; beaus. This Lyman Mertzheimer, now,--his
pop&#8217;s the richest farmer round here and Lyman&#8217;s
the only child. He&#8217;d be a good catch, mebbe.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; Amanda said in
her quick way, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217;
of such things. Anyhow, I don&#8217;t like Lyman so
good. He&#8217;s all the time braggin&#8217; about
his pop&#8217;s money and how much his mom pays for
things, and at school he don&#8217;t play fair at
recess. Sometimes, too, he cheats in school when we
have a spellin&#8217; match Friday afternoons. Then
he traps head and thinks he&#8217;s smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Amos nodded his head. &#8220;Chip o&#8217; the
old block.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; chided
Millie, &#8220;ain&#8217;t you ashamed, Amos, to put
such notions in a little girl&#8217;s head, about
beaus and such things?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The man chuckled. &#8220;What&#8217;s
born in heads don&#8217;t need to be put in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda wondered what he meant, but
her mother and Millie laughed.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Women&#8217;s women,&#8221;
he added knowingly. &#8220;Some wakes up sooner than
others, that&#8217;s all! Millie, when you goin&#8217;
to get you a man? You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; along
now--just about my age, so I know--abody that cooks
like you do-- "</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amos, you just keep quiet!
I ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for a man. I got a home,
and if I want something to growl at me I&#8217;ll go
pull the dog&#8217;s tail.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">That evening the kitchen of the Reist
farmhouse was a busy place. Baskets of apples stood
on the floor. On the table were huge earthen dishes
ready for the pared fruit. Equipped with a paring knife
and a tin pie-plate for parings every member of the
household drew near the table and began snitzing.
There was much merry conversation, some in quaint
Pennsylvania Dutch, then again in English tinged with
the distinctive accent. There was also much laughter
as Uncle Amos vied with Millie for the honor of making
the thinnest parings.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here comes Lyman. Make place
for him,&#8221; cried Amanda as a boy of fifteen came
to the kitchen door.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You can&#8217;t come in here
unless you work,&#8221; challenged Uncle Amos.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I can do that,&#8221; said
the boy, though he seemed none too eager to take the
knife and plate Mrs. Reist offered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare sit beside me,&#8221; Amanda offered.</p>

<p align="left">Lyman smiled his appreciation of the
honor, but the girl&#8217;s eyes twinkled as she added,
&#8220;so I can watch that you make thin peelin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said
Uncle Amos. &#8220;Boys, listen! Mostly always when
a woman&#8217;s kind to you there&#8217;s something
back of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, Amos, you&#8217;re soured,&#8221; said
Millie.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No, not me,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I know there&#8217;s still a few good women
in the world. Ach, yea,&#8221; he sighed deeply and
looked the incarnation of misery, &#8220;soon I&#8217;ll
have three to boss me, with Amanda here growin&#8217;
like a weed!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know,&#8221;
Mrs. Reist reminded him, &#8220;how Granny used to
say that one good boss is better than six poor workers?
You don&#8217;t appreciate us, Amos.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I give up.&#8221; Uncle Amos
spread his hands in surrender. &#8220;I give up. When
women start arguin&#8217; where&#8217;s a man comin&#8217;
in at?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give up,&#8221;
spoke out Lyman. &#8220;A man ought to have the last
word every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, you don&#8217;t know women,&#8221; said
Uncle Amos, chuckling.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;A man was made to be master,&#8221;
the youth went on, evidently quoting some recent reading.
&#8220;Woman is the weaker vessel.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Wait till you try to break
one,&#8221; came Uncle Amos&#8217;s wise comment.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I,&#8221; said Lyman proudly,
&#8220;I could be master of any woman I marry! And
I bet, I dare to bet my pop&#8217;s farm, that any
girl I set out to get I can get, too. I&#8217;d just
carry her off or something. &#8217;All&#8217;s fair
in love and war.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Them two&#8217;s the same thing,
sonny, but you don&#8217;t know it yet,&#8221; laughed
Uncle Amos. &#8220;It sounds mighty strong and brave
to talk like you were a giant or king, or something,
and I only hope I&#8217;m livin&#8217; and here in
Crow Hill so I can see how you work that game of carryin&#8217;
off the girl you like. I&#8217;d like to see it, I&#8217;d
sure like to see it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Uncle Amos, tell us, did
you ever go to see the girls?&#8221; asked Amanda
eagerly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Did I ever go to see the girls?
Um-uh, I did!&#8221; The man laughed suddenly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you about the first time. But now you just go
on with your snitzin&#8217;. I can&#8217;t be breakin&#8217;
up the party with my yarns. I was just a young fellow
workin&#8217; at home on the farm. Theje was a nice
girl over near Manheim I thought I&#8217;d like to
know better, and so one night I fixed up to try my
luck and go see her. It was in fall and got dark pretty
early, and by the time I was done with the farm work
and dressed in my best suit and half-way over to her
house, it was gettin&#8217; dusk. Now I never knew
what it was to be afraid till that year my old Aunty
Betz came to spend a month with us and began to tell
her spook stories. She had a long list of them. One
was about a big black dog that used to come in her
room every night durin&#8217; full moon and put its
paws on her bed. But when she tried to touch it there
was nothing there, and if she&#8217;d get up and light
the light it would vanish. She said she always thought
he wanted to show her something, take her to where
there was some gold buried, but she never could get
the dog to do it, for she always lighted the light
and that scared him away. Then she said one time they
moved into a little house, and once when they had a
lot of company she slept on a bed in the garret. She
got awake at night and found the covers off the bed.
She pulled &#8217;em up and something pulled them
off. Then she lighted a candle, but there wasn&#8217;t
a thing there. So she went back to bed and the same
thing happened again; down went the covers. She got
frightened and ran down the stairs and slept on the
floor. But that spook was always a mystery. I used
to have shivers chasin&#8217; each other up and down
my back so fast I didn&#8217;t know how to sit up
hardly when she was tellin&#8217; them spook stories.
But she had one champion one about a man she knew
who was walkin&#8217; along the country road at night
and something black shot up in front of him, and when
he tried to catch it and ran after it, he rolled into
a fence, and when he sat up, the spook was gone, but
there was a great big hole by the fence-post near
him, and in the hole was a box of money. She could
explain that ghost; it was the spirit of the person
who had buried the money, and he had to help some
person find it so that he could have peace in the
other world. Well, as I said, I was goin&#8217; along
the road on the way to see that girl, and it was about
dark when I got to the lane of her house. I was a
little excited, for it was my first trial at the courtin&#8217;
business. Aunty Betz&#8217;s spook stories made me
kinda shaky in the dark, so it&#8217;s no wonder I
jumped when something black ran across the road and
stood by the fence as I came along. I remembered her
story of the man who found the gold, and I thought
I&#8217;d see whether I could have such luck, so I
ran to the black thing and made a grab--and--it was
a skunk! Well,"--after the laughter died down--"I didn&#8217;t
get any gold, but I got something! I yelled, and the
girl I started to call on heard me and come to the
door. I hadn&#8217;t any better sense than to go up
to her. But before I could explain, the skunk&#8217;s
weapon told the tale. &#8216;You clear out of here,&#8217;
she hollered; &#8217;who wants such a smell in the
house!&#8217; I cleared out, and when I got home Mom
was in bed, but Pop was readin&#8217; the paper in
the kitchen. I opened the door. &#8217;Clear out of
here,&#8217; he ordered;&#8217; who wants such a smell
in the house! Go to the wood-shed and I&#8217;ll get
you soap and water and other clothes.&#8217; So I went
to the wood-shed, and he came out with a lantern and
water and clothes and I began to scrub. After I was
dressed we went to the barn-yard and he held the lantern
while I dug a deep hole, and the clothes, my best
Sunday clothes, went down into the ground and dirt
on top. And that settled courtin&#8217; for a while
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Amos&#8217;s story <i>had</i> interfered with
the snitzing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;how
can abody snitz apples when you make &#8217;em laugh
till the tears run down over the face?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; cried Amanda,
&#8220;I just thought of it--let&#8217;s tell fortunes
with the peelin&#8217;s! Everybody peel an apple with
the peelin&#8217; all in one piece and then throw
it over the right shoulder, and whatever letter it
makes on the floor is the initial of the person you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right. Now, Millie, no
cheatin&#8217;,&#8221; teased Uncle Amos. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you go peel yours so it&#8217;ll fall into a Z, for
I know that Zach Miller&#8217;s been after you this
long while already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, him? He&#8217;s as ugly as seven days&#8217;
rainy weather.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, shoot it,&#8221; said
Phil, disgust written on his face as he threw a paring
over his shoulder; &#8220;mine always come out an S.
Guess that&#8217;s the only letter you can make. S
for Sadie, Susie--who wants them? That&#8217;s a rotten
way to tell fortunes!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now look at mine, everybody!&#8221;
cried Amanda as she flung her long apple paring over
her shoulder.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s an M,&#8221; shouted
Phil. &#8220;Mebbe for Martin Landis. Jiminy Christmas,
he&#8217;s a pretty nice fellow. If you can hook him----&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;M stands for Mertzheimer,&#8221;
said Lyman proudly. &#8220;I guess it means me, Amanda,
so you better begin to mind me now when we play at
recess at school and spell on my side in the spelling
matches.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Huh,&#8221; she retorted ungraciously,
&#8220;Lyman Mertzheimer, you ain&#8217;t the only
M in Lancaster County!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied arrogantly,
&#8220;but I guess that poor Mart Landis don&#8217;t
count. He&#8217;s always tending one of his mom&#8217;s
babies--some nice beau he&#8217;d make! If he ever
goes courting he&#8217;ll have to take along one of
the little Landis kids, I bet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Phil laughed, but Amanda flushed in
anger. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s just grand of Martin
to help his mom like that,&#8221; she defended. &#8220;Anyhow,
since she has no big girls to help her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He washes dishes. I saw him
last week with an apron on,&#8221; said Lyman, contempt
in his voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you do that
for your mom if she was poor and had a lot of children
and no one to help her?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not me! I wouldn&#8217;t wash
dishes for no one! Men aren&#8217;t made for that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then <i>I</i> don&#8217;t think
much of <i>you</i>, Lyman Mertzheimer!&#8221; declared
Amanda with a vigorous toss of her red head.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; Mrs. Reist
interrupted, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t quarrel. Of course
Lyman would help his mother if she needed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amanda laughed and friendliness was once more restored.</p>

<p align="left">When the last apple was snitzed Uncle
Amos brought some cold cider from the spring-house,
Millie fetched a dish of cookies from the cellar, and
the snitzing party ended in a feast.</p>

<p align="left">That night Mrs. Reist followed Amanda
up the stairs to the child&#8217;s bedroom. They made
a pretty picture as they stood there, the mother with
her plain Mennonite garb, her sweet face encircled
by a white cap, and the little red-haired child, eager,
active, her dark eyes glimpsing dreams as they focused
on the distant castles in Spain which were a part
of her legitimate heritage of childhood. The room was
like a Nutting picture, with its rag carpet, old-fashioned,
low cherry bed, covered with a pink and white calico
patchwork quilt, its low cherry bureau, its rush-bottom
chairs, its big walnut chest covered with a hand-woven
coverlet gay with red roses and blue tulips. An old-fashioned
room and an old-fashioned mother and daughter--the
elder had seen life, knew its glories and its dangers,
had tasted its sweetness and drained its cups of sorrow,
but the child--in her eyes was still the star-dust
of the &#8220;trailing clouds of glory.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mom,&#8221; she asked suddenly
as her mother unbraided the red hair and brushed it,
&#8220;do you like Lyman Mertzheimer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why--yes---&#8221; Mrs. Reist hesitated.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I don&#8217;t mean that
way, Mom,&#8221; the child said wisely. &#8220;You
always say abody must like everybody, but I mean like
him for real, like him so you want to be near him.
He&#8217;s good lookin&#8217;. At school he&#8217;s
about the best lookin&#8217; boy there. The big girls
say he&#8217;s a regular Dunnis, whatever that is.
But I think sometimes he ain&#8217;t so pretty under
the looks, the way he acts and all, Mom.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I know what you mean, Amanda.
Your pop used to say still that people are like apples,
some can fool you good. Remember some we peeled to-night
were specked and showed it on the outside, but some
were red and pretty and when you cut in them--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were full of worms or rotten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s the hearts of people that makes
them beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see, Mom, and I&#8217;ll
mind to remember that. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; to know
a lot o&#8217; things now, Mom, ain&#8217;t? I like
when you tell me things my pop said. I&#8217;m glad
I was big enough to remember him. I know yet what nice
eyes he had, like they was always smilin&#8217; at
you. I wish he wouldn&#8217;t died, but I&#8217;m
glad he&#8217;s not dead for always. People don&#8217;t
stay dead like peepies or birds, do they?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No, they&#8217;ll live again
some day.&#8221; The mother&#8217;s voice was low,
but a divine trust shone in her eyes. &#8220;Life
would be nothing if it could end for us like it does
for the birds.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Millie says the souls of people
can&#8217;t die. That it&#8217;s with people just
like it&#8217;s with the apple trees. In winter they
look dead and like all they&#8217;re good for was
to chop down and burn, then in spring they get green
and the flowers come on them and they&#8217;re alive,
and we know they&#8217;re alive. I&#8217;m glad people
are like that, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She gathered the
child to her arms and kissed the sensitive, eager
little face. Neither Mrs. Reist nor Amanda, as yet,
had read Locksley Hall, but the truth expressed there
was echoing in their souls:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Gone forever! Ever? no--for since
our dying race began,<br>
&#160;&#160;Ever, ever, and forever was the leading
light of man.<br>
&#160;&#160;Indian warriors dream of ampler hunting
grounds beyond the night;<br>
&#160;&#160;Even the black Australian dying hopes
he shall return, a white.<br>
&#160;&#160;Truth for truth, and good for good! The
good, the true, the pure, the<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;just--<br>
&#160;&#160;Take the charm &#8216;Forever&#8217; from
them, and they crumble into dust.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Mom,&#8221; the child
asked a few moments later, &#8220;do you mind that
Christmas and the big doll?&#8221; An eager light dwelt
in the little girl&#8217;s eyes as she thought back
to the happy time when her big, laughing father had
made one in the family circle.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The mother smiled
a bit sadly. But Amanda prattled on gaily.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That was the best Christmas
ever I had! You mind how we went to market in Lancaster,
Pop and you and I, near Christmas, and in a window
of a store we saw a great, grand, big doll. She was
bigger&#8217;n me and had light hair and blue eyes.
I wanted her, and I told you and Pop and coaxed for
you to buy her. Next week when we went to market and
passed the store she was still in the window. Then
one day Pop went to Lancaster alone and when he came
home I asked if the doll was still there, and he said
she wasn&#8217;t in the window. I cried, and was so
disappointed and you said to Pop, &#8216;That&#8217;s
a shame, Philip.&#8217; And I thought, too, it was
a shame he let somebody else buy that doll when I
wanted it so. Then on Christmas morning--what do you
think--I came down-stairs and ran for my presents,
and there was that same big doll settin&#8217; on
the table in the room! Millie and you had dressed her
in a blue dress. Course she wasn&#8217;t in the window
when I asked Pop, for he had bought her! He laughed,
and we all laughed, and we had the best Christmas.
I sat on my little rocking-chair and rocked her, and
then I&#8217;d sit her on the sofa and look at her--I
was that proud of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s five, six years ago, Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I was <i>little</i> then.
I mind a story about that little rockin&#8217;-chair,
too, Mom. It&#8217;s up in the garret now; I&#8217;m
too big for it. But when I first got it I thought
it was wonderful fine. Once Katie Hiestand came here
with her mom, and we were playin&#8217; with our dolls
and not thinkin&#8217; of the chair, and then Katie
saw it and sat in it. And right aways I wanted to
set in it, too, and I made her get off. But you saw
it and you told me I must not be selfish, but must
be polite and let her set in it. My, I remember lots
of things.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Amanda, if
you remember such things, for I want you to grow up
into a nice, good woman.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Like you and Millie, ain&#8217;t?
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to. I ain&#8217;t forgot, neither,
that once when I laughed at Katie for saying the Dutch
word for calendar and gettin&#8217; all her English
mixed with Dutch, you told me it&#8217;s not nice
to laugh at people. But I forgot it the other day,
Mom, when we laughed at Aunt Rebecca and treated her
mean. But she&#8217;s so cranky and--and---&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she helped sew on your dresses,&#8221;
added the mother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now that was ugly for us to
act so! Why, ain&#8217;t it funny, Mom, it sounds
so easy to say abody should be kind and yet sometimes
it&#8217;s so hard to do it. When Aunt Rebecca comes
next time I&#8217;m just goin&#8217; to see once if
I can&#8217;t be nice to her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Of course you are. She&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to-morrow to help with the apple butter.
But now you must go to sleep or you can&#8217;t get
up early to see Millie put the cider on. Philip, he&#8217;s
asleep this long while already.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">A few minutes later the child was
in bed and called a last good-night to the mother,
who stood in the hall, a little lighted lamp in her
hand. Amanda had an eye for beauty and the picture
of her mother pleased her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Mom,&#8221; she called,
&#8220;just stand that way a little once, right there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, you look wonderful like
a picture I saw once, in that gray dress and the lamp
in your hand. It&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; chided the
mother gently, &#8220;you go to sleep now. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; Amanda called after the
retreating figure.</p>

<a name="ch3"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER III</h1>

<h2 align="center">Boiling the Apple Butter</h2>

<p align="left">Amanda rose early the next morning.
Apple-butter boiling day was always a happy one for
her. She liked to watch the fire under the big copper
kettle, to help with the ceaseless stirring with a
long-handled stirrer. She thrilled at the breathless
moment when her mother tested the thick, dark contents
of the kettle and announced, &#8220;It&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">At dawn she went up the stairs with
Uncle Amos to the big attic and opened and closed
doors for him as he carried the heavy copper kettle
down to the yard. Then she made the same trip with
Millie and helped to carry from the attic heavy stone
crocks in which to store the apple butter.</p>

<p align="left">After breakfast she went out to the
grassy spot in the rear of the garden where an iron
tripod stood and began to gather shavings and paper
in readiness for the fire. She watched Millie scour
the great copper kettle until its interior shone,
then it was lifted on the tripod, the cider poured
into it, and the fire started. Logs were fed to the
flames until a roaring fire was in blast. Several times
Millie skimmed the foam from the cider.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This is one time when signs
don&#8217;t work,&#8221; the hired girl confided to
the child. &#8220;Your Aunt Rebecca says that if you
cook apple butter in the up-sign of the almanac it
boils over easy, but it&#8217;s the down-sign to-day,
and yet this cider boils up all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I guess it&#8217;ll all burn
in the bottom,&#8221; said Amanda, &#8220;if it&#8217;s
the down-sign.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not if you stir it good when
the snitz are in. That&#8217;s the time the work begins.
Here&#8217;s your mom and Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Mom,"--Amanda ran to meet
her mother--"this here&#8217;s awful much fun! I wish
we&#8217;d boil apple butter every few days.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Just wait once,&#8221; said
Millie, &#8220;till you&#8217;re a little bigger and
want to go off to picnics or somewhere and got to
stay home and help to stir apple butter. Then you&#8217;ll
not like it so well. Why, Mrs. Hershey was tellin&#8217;
me last week how mad her girls get still if the apple
butter&#8217;s got to be boiled in the hind part of
the week when they want to be done and dressed and
off to visit or to Lancaster instead of gettin&#8217;
their eyes full of smoke stirrin&#8217; apple butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Reist laughed.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But,&#8221; Amanda said with
a tender glance at the hired girl, &#8220;I guess
Hershey&#8217;s ain&#8217;t got no Millie like we to
help.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, pack off now with you,&#8221;
Millie said, trying to frown. &#8220;I got to stop
this spoilin&#8217; you. You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
stand in the hot sun and stir apple butter while you
go off on a picnic or so when you&#8217;re big enough
to help good?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But that&#8217;s just what
you would do! I know you! Didn&#8217;t you spend almost
your whole Christmas savin&#8217; fund on me and Phil
last year?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, you talk too much! Let
me be, now, I got to boil apple butter.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Philip ran for several boxes and old
chairs and put them under a spreading cherry tree.
&#8220;We take turns stirrin&#8217;,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;so those that don&#8217;t stir can take it
easy while they wait their turn. Jiminy Christmas,
guess we&#8217;ll have a regular party to-day. All
of us are in it, and Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s comin&#8217;,
and Lyman Mertzheimer, and I guess Martin Landis,
and mebbe some of the little Landis ones and the whole
Crow Hill will be here. Here comes Millie with the
snitz!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The pared apples were put into the
kettle, then the stirring commenced. A long wooden
stirrer, with a handle ten feet long, was used, the
big handle permitting the stirrer to stand a comfortable
distance from the smoke and fire.</p>

<p align="left">The boiling was well under way when
Aunt Rebecca arrived.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, Philip,&#8221;
she began as soon as she neared the fire, &#8220;you
just stir half! You must do it all around the bottom
of the kettle or the butter&#8217;ll burn fast till
it&#8217;s done. Here, let me do it once.&#8221; She
took the handle from his hands and began to stir vigorously.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried the boy.
&#8220;Now we can roast apples. Here, comes Lyman up
the road, and Martin Landis and the baby. Now we&#8217;ll
have some fun!&#8221; He pointed to the toad, where
Martin Landis, a neighbor boy, drew near with his
two-year-old brother on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you keep away from the fire,&#8221; ordered
Aunt Rebecca.</p>

<p align="left">The children ran off to the yard to
greet the newcomers and soon came back joined by Lyman
and Martin and the ubiquitous baby.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I told you,&#8221; Lyman said
with mocking smiles, &#8220;that Martin would have
to bring the baby along.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin Landis was fifteen, but hard
work and much responsibility had added to him wisdom
and understanding beyond his years. His frank, serious
face could at times assume the look of a man of ripened
experience. At Lyman&#8217;s words it burned scarlet.
&#8220;Ach, go on,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;it&#8217;d
do you good if you had a few to carry around; mebbe
then you wouldn&#8217;t be such a dude.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">That brought the laugh at the expense
of the other boy, who turned disdainfully away and
walked to Aunt Rebecca with an offer to stir the apple
butter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; she said in a
determined voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Give me the baby,&#8221; said
Mrs. Reist, &#8220;then you children can go play.&#8221;
The little tot ran to her outstretched arms and was
soon laughing at her soft whispers about young chickens
to feed and ducks to see.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now,&#8221; Amanda cried happily,
&#8220;since Mom keeps the baby we&#8217;ll roast corn
and apples under the kettle.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">In spite of Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s protest,
green corn and ripe apples were soon encased in thick
layers of mud and poked upon the glowing bed under
the kettle.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Abody&#8217;d think none o&#8217;
you had breakfast,&#8221; she said sternly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; said Mrs. Reist,
&#8220;these just taste better because they&#8217;re
wrapped in mud. I used to do that at home when I was
little.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I never did. They&#8217;ll
get burned yet with their foolin&#8217; round the
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Her prophecy came perilously close
to fulfilment later in the day. Amanda, bending near
the fire to turn a mud-coated apple, drew too close
to the lurking flames. Her gingham dress was ready
fuel for the fire. Suddenly a streak of flame leaped
up the hem of it. Aunt Rebecca screamed. Lyman cried
wildly, &#8220;Where&#8217;s some water?&#8221; But
before Mrs. Reist could come to the rescue Martin
Landis had caught the frightened child and thrown
her flat into a dense bed of bean vines near by, smothering
the flames.</p>

<p align="left">Then he raised her gently. Much handling
of his younger sisters and brothers had made him adept
with frightened children.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come, Manda,&#8221; he said
soothingly, &#8220;you&#8217;re not hurt. Just your
dress is burned a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand--it&#8217;s burned, I guess,&#8221;
she faltered.</p>

<p align="left">Again force of habit swayed Martin.
He bent over and kissed the few red marks on her fingers
as he often kissed the bumped heads and scratched
fingers of the little Landis children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach--&#8221; Amanda&#8217;s hand fluttered
under the kiss.</p>

<p align="left">Then a realization of what he had
done came to the boy. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he stammered,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean--I guess I oughtn&#8217;t
done that--I wasn&#8217;t thinking, Manda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Martin, it&#8217;s all
right. You didn&#8217;t hurt it none.&#8221; She misunderstood
him. &#8220;See, it ain&#8217;t hurt bad at all. But,
Martin, you scared me when you threw me in that bean
patch! But it put the fire out. You&#8217;re smart
to think of that so quick.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Mrs. Reist
found her voice, and the color crept back to her cheeks
again. &#8220;Martin, I can&#8217;t thank you enough.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um,&#8221; Lyman said sneeringly,
&#8220;now I suppose Martin&#8217;s a hero.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So he is!&#8221; said the little
girl with decision. &#8220;He saved my life, and I
ain&#8217;t forgettin&#8217; it neither.&#8221; Then
she sat down by her mother&#8217;s side and began
to play with the baby.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, guess the fun&#8217;s
over,&#8221; said Lyman. &#8220;You went and spoiled
it by catching fire.&#8221; He went off in sulky mood.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; exclaimed
Aunt Rebecca, &#8220;mebbe now you&#8217;ll keep away
from this fire once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda kept away. The fun of the apple-butter
boiling was ended for her. She sat quietly under the
tree while Millie and Aunt Rebecca and Phil took turns
at stirring. She watched passively while Millie poured
pounds of sugar into the boiling mass. She even missed
the customary thrill as some of the odorous contents
of the kettle were tested and the verdict came, &#8220;It&#8217;s
done!&#8221; The thrills of apple-butter boiling were
as nothing to her now. She still felt the wonder of
being rescued from the fire, rescued by a nice boy
with a strong arm and a gentle voice-- what if it
was only a boy she had known all her life!--her heart
enshrined its first hero that day.</p>

<p align="left">She forgot the terror that had seized
her as the flames licked up her dress, the scorching
touch on her hand was obliterated from her memory
and only the healing gentleness of the kiss remained.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He kissed my hand,&#8221; she
thought that night as she lay under her patchwork
quilt. &#8220;It was just like the stories we read
about in school about the &#8216;knights of old that
were brave and bold.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She thought of the picture on the
schoolhouse wall. Sir Galahad, the teacher had called
it, and read those lovely lines that Amanda remembered
and liked--"My strength is as the strength of ten because
my heart is pure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin was like that!</p>

<a name="ch4"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER IV</h1>

<h2 align="center">A Visit to Martin&#8217;s Mother</h2>

<p align="left">When Amanda awoke the next morning
her first thought was of the burnt hand and its healing
kiss. &#8220;Why, Martin--ach, Martin--he kissed my
hand,&#8221; she said softly to herself. &#8220;Just
like they do in the stories about knights--knights
always kiss their ladies&#8217; hands. Ach, I know
what I&#8217;ll do! I&#8217;ll play Martin Landis is
my knight and I&#8217;m his lady grand. Wish Mom was
here, then I&#8217;d ask her if she knows anything
about what knights do and how the ladies ought to
act to them. But she&#8217;s in Lancaster. Mebbe Millie
would know. I&#8217;ll go ask her once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Millie was baking pies when the girl
sought her for the information.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Millie!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, what?&#8221; The hired
girl brushed the flour from her bare arms and turned
to look at Amanda. &#8220;Now I know what you want--you
smell the pies and you want a half-moon sample to
eat before it&#8217;s right cold and get your stomach
upset and your face all pimply. Ain&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No,&#8221; began the child,
then added diplomatically, &#8220;why, yes, I do want
that, but that ain&#8217;t what I come for.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Millie laughed. &#8220;Then what?
But don&#8217;t bother me for long. I got lots to
do yet. I want to get the pies all done till your mom
gets back.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, Millie, I wondered, do
you know anything about knights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me. I sleep nights.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Millie--knights--the kind
you read about, the men that wear plumes in their
hats.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Feathers, you mean? Why, the
only man I ever heard of wearin&#8217; a feather in
his hat was Yankee Doodle.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Millie, you make me mad!
But I guess you don&#8217;t know. Well, tell me this--if
somebody did something for you and you wanted to show
you &#8217;preciated it, what would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s an easy one! I&#8217;d
be nice to them and do things for them or for their
people. Now you run and let me be. &#8217;Bout half
an hour from now you dare come in for your half-moon
pie. Ach, I most forgot! Your mom said you shall take
a little crock of the new apple butter down to Mrs.
Landis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little crock won&#8217;t go far with all
them children.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yes. It&#8217;ll smear
a lot o&#8217; bread. I&#8217;ll pack it in a basket
so you can carry it easy. Better put on your sunbonnet
so your hair won&#8217;t burn red.&#8221;</p>

<p align="center"><a href="illus-2.png"><img src="illus-2.png"  alt="The rhubarb leaf parasol" border="0" /></a><br />
The rhubarb leaf parasol</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Redder, you mean, ain&#8217;t?
But I won&#8217;t need a bonnet. I&#8217;ll take my
new parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parasol,&#8221; echoed Millie. &#8220;Now what---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But Amanda ran away, laughing, and
returned in a few minutes holding a giant rhubarb
leaf over her head. &#8220;Does the green silk of my
parasol look good with my hair?&#8221; she asked with
an exaggerated air of grandeur.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Go on, now,&#8221; Millie said,
laughing, &#8220;and don&#8217;t spill that apple butter
or you&#8217;ll get parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">With a merry good-bye Amanda set off,
the basket upon her arm, one hand grasping the red
stem of the rhubarb parasol while the great green leaf
flopped up and down upon her head in cool ministration.</p>

<p align="left">Down the sunny road she trudged, spasmodically
singing bits of gay songs, then again talking to herself.
&#8220;This here is a dandy parasol. Cooler&#8217;n
a real one and lots nicer&#8217;n a bonnet or a hat.
Only I wish it was bigger, so my arms would be covered,
for it&#8217;s hot out to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When she reached the little red brick
country schoolhouse, half-way between her home and
the Landis farm, she paused in the shade of a great
oak that grew in the school-yard.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll rest the apple
butter a while in this shade,&#8221; she said to herself,
&#8220;and pick a bouquet for my knight&#8217;s mom.&#8221;
 From the grassy roadside she gathered yellow and
gold butter-and-eggs, blue spikes of false dragon&#8217;s
head, and edged them with a lacy ruffle of wild carrot
flowers.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;There, that&#8217;s grand!&#8221;
she said as she held the bouquet at arm&#8217;s length
and surveyed it carefully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold it
out, just so, and I&#8217;ll say to Mrs. Landis, &#8216;Mother
of my knight, I salute you!&#8217; I know she&#8217;ll
be surprised. Mebbe I might tell her just how brave
her Martin is and how I made him a knight. She&#8217;ll
be glad. It must be a satisfaction to have a boy a
knight.&#8221; She smiled in happy anticipation of
the wonderful message she was going to bring Mrs.
Landis. Then she replaced the rhubarb parasol over
her head, picked up the basket, and went down the
country road to the Landis farm.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s good Landis&#8217;s
don&#8217;t live far from our place,&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;My parasol&#8217;s wiltin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Like the majority of houses in the
Crow Hill section of country, the Landis house was
set in a frame of green trees and old-fashioned flower
gardens. It flaunted in the face of the passer-by an
old-time front yard. The wide brick walk that led
straight from the gate to the big front porch was
edged on both sides with a row of bricks placed corners
up. On either side of the walk were bushes, long since
placed without the discriminating eye of a landscape
gardener but holding in their very randomness a charm
unrivaled by any precise planting. Mock-orange bushes
and lilacs towered above the low deutzias, while masses
of zinnias, petunias, four-o&#8217;clocks, and a score
of other old-fashioned posies crowded against each
other in the long beds that edged the walks and in
the smaller round beds that were dotted here and there
in the grass. Jaded motorists from the city drove
their cars slowly past the glory of the Landis riot
of blossoms.</p>

<p align="left">As Amanda neared the place she looked
ruefully at her knot of wild flowers. &#8220;She&#8217;s
got so many pretty ones,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;But,
ach, I guess she&#8217;ll like these here, too, long
as they&#8217;re a present.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Two of the Landis children ran to
greet Amanda as she opened the gate and entered the
yard.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay my parasol by
the gate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your
mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;In the kitchen, cannin&#8217;
blackberries,&#8221; said little Henry.</p>

<p align="left">As Amanda rounded the corner of the
house, the two children clinging to her arm, Mrs.
Landis came to the kitchen door.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother of my knight, I salute
you,&#8221; said Amanda, making as low a bow as the
two barnacle children, the bouquet and the basket with
its crock of apple butter, would allow.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Landis.
&#8220;Now what was that you said? The children make
so much noise I can&#8217;t hear sometimes. Henry,
don&#8217;t hang so on Amanda&#8217;s arm, it&#8217;s
too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I said--why, I said--I have
some apple butter for you that Mom sent and I picked
a bouquet for you,&#8221; the child replied, her courage
suddenly gone from her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, ain&#8217;t that nice!
Come right in.&#8221; The woman held the screen door
open for the visitor.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Landis, mother of the imaginary
knight and of six other children, was a sturdy, well-built
woman, genial and good-natured, as stout people are
reputed to be. In spite of hard work she retained a
look of youthfulness about her which her plain Mennonite
dress and white cap accentuated. An artist with an
appreciative eye might have said that the face of
that mother was like a composite picture of all the
Madonnas of the old masters--tender, love-lighted yet
far-seeing and reverent.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda had always loved Mrs. Landis
and spent many hours in her home, attracted by the
baby--there always was one, either in arms or just
wobbling about on chubby little legs.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now ain&#8217;t it nice of
your mom to send us that new apple butter! And for
you to pick the flowers for me! Sattie for both. I
say still that the wild flowers beat the ones on the
garden beds. And how pretty you fixed them!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mom, Mom,&#8221; whispered
little Henry, &#8220;dare I smear me a piece of bread?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you don&#8217;t make crumbs.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Mom,&#8221; cried Mary
Landis, who came running in from the yard. &#8220;What
d&#8217;you think? Manda left her green parasol out
by the front gate and Henry&#8217;s chewed the handle
off of it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Chewed the handle off a parasol--what--how?&#8221;
said the surprised mother.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda laughed. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
you worry about it, Mrs. Landis,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;for it was a rhubarb parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh!&#8221; A merry laugh followed
the announcement about the edible parasol handle and
Mrs. Landis went back to spreading thick slices of
bread with apple butter while three pairs of eager
hands were reaching out to her.</p>

<p align="left">A tiny wail which soon grew in volume
sounded from a room in the front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;The baby&#8217;s awake,&#8221; said Amanda.
&#8220;Dare I fetch him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Go right in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda went through two rooms and
came to a semi-darkened side room where the smallest
Landis was putting forth a loud protest at his fancied
neglect.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come on, Johnny, don&#8217;t
cry no more. Manda&#8217;s goin&#8217; to take you--see!&#8221;
She raised the baby, who changed from crying to laughter.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he dear!&#8221;
Amanda said as she brought the baby into the kitchen.
&#8220;And so bright he is for not quite six months
old. I remember how old he is because it was on my
mom&#8217;s last birthday in March that Millie said
you had another baby and I remember, too, that Aunt
Rebecca was there and she said, &#8216;What, them
Landis&#8217;s got another baby! Poor thing!&#8217;
I asked Mom why she said that and she thought Aunt
Rebecca meant that babies make so much work for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, abody works anyhow, might
as well work tendin&#8217; babies. Put your cheek
against Johnny&#8217;s face once, Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda bent her head and touched the
soft cheek of the child. &#8220;Why,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t it soft, now! Ain&#8217;t babies
just too dear and sweet! I guess Aunt Rebecca don&#8217;t
know how nice they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing,&#8221; said Mrs. Landis.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Poor--she ain&#8217;t poor!&#8221;
Amanda corrected her. &#8220;She owns two farms and
got lots of money besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But no children--poor thing,&#8221; repeated
Mrs. Landis.</p>

<p>Amanda looked at her, wondering.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda,&#8221; said the white-capped
mother as she wiped some blackberry juice from little
Henry&#8217;s fingers, &#8220;abody can have lots of
money and yet be poor, and others can have hardly
any money and yet be rich. It&#8217;s all in what
abody means by rich and what kind of treasures you
set store by. I wouldn&#8217;t change places with
your rich Aunt Rebecca for all the farms in Lancaster
County.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I guess not!&#8221; Amanda
could understand her attitude. &#8220;And Mom and
Millie say still you got such nice children. But Martin
now,&#8221; she said with assumed seriousness as she
saw him step on the porch to enter the kitchen--"your
Martin pushed me in a bean patch yesterday and I fell
down flat on my face.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin!&#8221; his mother began
sternly. &#8220;What for did you act so?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda, don&#8217;t you tell!&#8221;
the boy commanded, his face flushing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you dare tell!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I got to now, I started it.
Ach, Mrs. Landis, you dare be proud of him! My dress
caught fire and none of us had sense but him. He smothered
it by throwin&#8217; me in the bean patch and he--he&#8217;s
a hero!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;A hero!&#8221; cried little
Henry. &#8220;Mart&#8217;s a hero!&#8221; while the
mother smiled proudly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Manda Reist,&#8221; Martin
spoke quickly as he edged to the door. &#8220;Amanda
Reist, next time--next time I&#8217;ll--darn it, I&#8217;ll
just let you burn up!&#8221; He ran from the room
and disappeared round the corner of the house.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why"--Amanda&#8217;s lips trembled--"ain&#8217;t
he mean! I just wanted to be nice to him and he got
mad.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him,&#8221;
soothed the mother. &#8220;Boys are funny. He&#8217;s
not mad at you, he just don&#8217;t like too much
fuss made over what he done. But all the time he&#8217;s
tickled all over to have you call him a hero.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh--are boys like that? Phil&#8217;s
not. But he ain&#8217;t a knight. I guess knights
like to pretend they&#8217;re very modest even if they&#8217;re
full of pride.&#8221; Mrs. Landis was too busy putting
blackberries into the jars to catch the import of
the child&#8217;s words. The word knight escaped her
hearing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I must go now,&#8221;
said the small visitor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, do, Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She put the baby in its coach, took
up the empty basket, and after numerous good-byes
to the children went down the road to her home. The
rhubarb parasol gone, the sun beat upon her uncovered
head but she was unmindful of the intense heat. Her
brain was wholly occupied with thoughts of Martin
Landis and his strange behavior.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Umph,&#8221; she decided finally,
&#8220;men <i>are</i> funny things! I&#8217;m just
findin&#8217; it out. And I guess knights are queerer&#8217;n
others yet! Wonder if Millie kept my half-moon pie
or if Phil sneaked it. Abody&#8217;s just got to watch
out for these men folks!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch5"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER V</h1>

<h2 align="center">At Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s House</h2>

<p align="left">Several weeks after the eventful apple-butter
boiling at the Reist farm, Aunt Rebecca invited the
Reist family to spend a Sunday at her home.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;,
Mom,&#8221; Philip announced. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like it there. Dare I stay home with Millie?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mebbe Millie wants to come
along,&#8221; suggested his mother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I guess not this time.
Just you go and Phil and I&#8217;ll stay and tend
the house and feed the chickens and look after things.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m goin&#8217;!&#8221;
spoke up Amanda. &#8220;Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s funny
and bossy but I like to go to her house, it&#8217;s
so little and cute, everything.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Cute,&#8221; scoffed the boy.
&#8220;Everything&#8217;s cute to a girl. You dare
go, I won&#8217;t! Last time I was there I picked
a few of her honeysuckle flowers and pulled that stem
out o&#8217; them to get the drop of honey that&#8217;s
in each one, and she caught me and slapped my hand--mind
you! Guess next she&#8217;ll be puttin&#8217; up some
scare-bees to keep the bees off her flowers. But say,
Manda, if she gives you any of them little red and
white striped peppermint candies like she does still,
sneak me a few.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Humph! You don&#8217;t go to
see her but you want her candy! I&#8217;d be ashamed,
Philip Reist!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hush, hush,&#8221; warned Mrs.
Reist. &#8220;Next you two&#8217;ll be fightin&#8217;,
and on a Sunday, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The girl laughed. &#8220;Ach, Mom,
guess we both got the tempers that goes with red hair.
But it&#8217;s Sunday, so I&#8217;ll be good. I&#8217;m
glad we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to Aunt Rebecca. That&#8217;s
a nice drive.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca lived alone in a cottage
at the edge of Landisville, a beautiful little town
several miles from the Reist farm at Crow Hill. During
her husband&#8217;s life they lived on one of the big
farms of Lancaster County, where she slaved in the
manual labor of the great fields. Many were the hours
she spent in the hot sun of the tobacco fields, riding
the planter in the early spring, later hoeing the rich
black soil close to the little young plants, in midsummer
finding and killing the big green tobacco worms and
topping and suckering the plants so that added value
might be given the broad, strong leaves. Then later
in the summer she helped the men to thread the harvested
stalks on laths and hang them in the long open shed
to dry.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca had married Jonas Miller,
a rich man. All the years of their life together on
the farm seemed a visible verification of the old
saying, &#8220;To him that hath shall be given.&#8221;
A special Providence seemed to hover over their acres
of tobacco. Storms and destructive hail appeared to
roam in a swath just outside their farm. The Jonas
Miller tobacco fields were reputed to be the finest
in the whole Garden Spot county, and the Jonas Miller
bank account grew correspondingly fast. But the bank
account, however quickly it increased, failed to give
Jonas Miller and his wife full pleasure, unless, as
some say, the mere knowledge of possession of wealth
can bring pleasure to miserly hearts. For Jonas Miller
was, in the vernacular of the Pennsylvania Dutch,
&#8220;almighty close.&#8221; Millie, Reists&#8217;
hired girl, said,&#8221; That there Jonas is too stingy
to buy long enough pants for himself. I bet he gets
boys&#8217; size because they&#8217;re cheaper, for
the legs o&#8217; them always just come to the top
o&#8217; his shoes. Whoever lays him out when he&#8217;s
dead once will have to put pockets in his shroud for
sure! And he&#8217;s made poor Becky just like him.
It ain&#8217;t in her family to be so near; why, Mrs.
Reist is always givin&#8217; somebody something! But
mebbe when he dies once and his wife gets the money
in her hand she&#8217;ll let it fly.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">However, when Jonas Miller died and
left the hoarded money to his wife she did not let
it fly. She rented the big farm and moved to the little
old-fashioned house in Landisville--a little house
whose outward appearance might have easily proclaimed
its tenant poor. There she lived alone, with occasional
visits and visitors to break the monotony of her existence.</p>

<p align="left">That Sunday morning of the Reist visit,
Uncle Amos hitched the horse to the carriage, tied
it by the front fence of the farm, then he went up-stairs
and donned his Sunday suit of gray cloth. Later he
brought out his broad-brimmed Mennonite hat and called
to Amanda and her mother, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready.
Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist wore a black cashmere shawl
pinned over her plain gray lawn dress and a stiff
black silk bonnet was tied under her chin. Amanda
skipped out to the yard, wearing a white dress with
a wide buff sash. A matching ribbon was tied on her
red hair.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Jiminy,&#8221; whistled Uncle
Amos as she ran to him and swung her leghorn hat on
its elastic. &#8220;Jiminy, you&#8217;re pretty---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, am I, Uncle Amos?&#8221;
She smiled radiantly. &#8220;Am I really pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hold on, here!&#8221; He tried
to look very sober. &#8220;If you ain&#8217;t growin&#8217;
up for sure! Lookin&#8217; for compliments a&#8217;ready,
same as all the rest. I was goin&#8217; to say that
you&#8217;re pretty fancy dressed for havin&#8217;
a Mennonite mom.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Uncle Amos!&#8221; Amanda
laughed and tossed her head so the yellow bow danced
like a butterfly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you
at all! You&#8217;re too good to be findin&#8217;
fault like that! Millie says so, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She does, eh? She does? Just
what does Millie say about me now?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, she said yesterday that
you&#8217;re the nicest man and have the biggest heart
of any person she knows.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um--so! And Millie says that,
does she? Um--so! well, well"--a glow of joy spread
in his face and stained his neck and ears. Fortunately,
for his future peace of mind, the child did not notice
the flush. A swallowtail butterfly had flitted among
the zinnias and attracted the attention of Amanda
so it was diverted from her uncle. But he still smiled
as Millie opened the front door and she and Mrs. Reist
stepped on the porch.</p>

<p align="left">Millie, in her blue gingham dress
and her checked apron, her straight hair drawn back
from her plain face, was certainly no vision to cause
the heart of the average man to pump faster. But as
Amos looked at her he saw suddenly something lovelier
than her face. She walked to the gate, smoothing the
shawl of Mrs. Reist, patting the buff sash of the
little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big heart,&#8221; thought Amos, &#8220;it&#8217;s
her got the big heart!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good-bye, safe journey,&#8221;
the hired girl called after them as they started down
the road. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about us. Me and
Phil can manage alone. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The road to Landisville led past green
fields of tobacco and corn, large farmhouses where
old-fashioned flowers made a vivid picture in the
gardens, orchards and woodland tracts, their green
shade calling invitingly. Once they crossed a wandering
little creek whose shallow waters flowed through lovely
meadows where boneset plants were white with bloom
and giant eupatorium lifted its rosy heads. A red-headed
flicker flew screaming from a field as they passed,
and a fussy wren scolded at them from a fence corner.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She&#8217;ll have a big job,&#8221;
said Uncle Amos, &#8220;if she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to scold every team and automobile that passes here
this mornin&#8217;. Such a little thing to be so sassy!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As they came to Landisville and drove
into the big churchyard there were already many carriages
standing in the shade of the long open shed and numerous
automobiles parked in the sunny yard.</p>

<p align="left">A few minutes later they entered the
big brick meeting-house and sat down in the calm of
the sanctuary. The whispers of newcomers drifted through
the open windows, steps sounded on the bare floor of
the church, but finally all had entered and quiet
fell upon the place.</p>

<p align="left">The simple service of the Mennonite
Church is always appealing and helpful. The music
of voices, without any accompaniment of musical instrument,
the simple prayers and sermons, are all devoid of
ostentation or ornamentation. Amanda liked to join
in the singing and did so lustily that morning. But
during the sermon she often fell to dreaming. The
quiet meeting-house where only the calm voice of the
preacher was heard invited the building of wonderful
castles in Spain. Their golden spires reared high
in the blue of heaven... she would be a lady in a
trailing, silken gown, Martin would come, a plumed
and belted knight, riding on a pure white steed like
that in the Sir Galahad picture at school, and he&#8217;d
repeat to her those beautiful words, &#8220;My strength
is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure.&#8221;
Was there really any truth in that poem? Could one
be strong as ten because the heart was pure? Of course!
It had to be true! Martin could be like that. He&#8217;d
lift her to the saddle on the pure white horse and
they&#8217;d ride away together to one of those beautiful
castles in Spain, high up on the mountains, so high
they seemed above the clouds...</p>

<p align="left">Then she came back to earth suddenly.
The meeting was over and Aunt Rebecca stood ready
to take them to her home.</p>

<p align="left">The country roads were filled with
carriages and automobiles; the occupants of the former
nodded a cordial how-de-do, though most of them were
strangers, but the riders in the motors sped past without
a sign of friendliness.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; said Aunt
Rebecca, &#8220;since them automobiles is so common
abody don&#8217;t get many how-de-dos no more as you
travel along the country roads. Used to be everybody&#8217;d
speak to everybody else they&#8217;d meet on the road--here,
Amos,&#8221; she laid a restraining hand upon the reins.
&#8220;Stop once! I see a horseshoe layin&#8217; in
the road and it&#8217;s got two nails in it, too.
That&#8217;s powerful good luck! Stop once and let
me get it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amos chuckled and with a loud &#8220;Whoa&#8221;
brought the horse to a standstill. Aunt Rebecca climbed
from the carriage, picked up the trophy of good luck
and then took her seat beside her brother again, a
smile upon her lined old face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s three horseshoes
I have now. I never let one lay. I pick up all I find
and take them home and hang them on the old peach tree
in the back yard. I know they bring good luck. Mebbe
if I hadn&#8217;t picked up all them three a lot o&#8217;
trouble would come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Have it your way,&#8221; conceded
Uncle Amos. &#8220;They don&#8217;t do you no hurt,
anyhow. But, Rebecca,&#8221; he said as they came within
sight of her little house, &#8220;you ought to get
your place painted once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, my goodness, what for?
When it&#8217;s me here alone. I think the house looks
nice. My flowers are real pretty this year, once. Course,
I don&#8217;t fool with them like you do. I have the
kind that don&#8217;t take much tendin&#8217; and
come up every year without bein&#8217; planted. Calico
flowers and larkspur and lady-slippers are my kind.
This plantin&#8217; and hoein&#8217; at flowers is
all for nothin&#8217;. It&#8217;s all right to work
so at beans and potatoes and things you can eat when
they grow, but what good are flowers but to look at!
I done my share of hoein&#8217; and diggin&#8217; and
workin&#8217; in the ground. I near killed myself when
Jonas lived yet, in them tobacco patches. I used to
say to him still, we needn&#8217;t work so hard and
slave like that after we had so much money put away,
but he was for workin&#8217; as long as we could,
and so we kept on till he went. He used to say money
gets all if you begin to spend it and don&#8217;t earn
more. Jonas was savin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He sure was, that he was,&#8221;
seconded Uncle Amos with a twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;Savin&#8217;
for you and now you&#8217;re savin&#8217; for somebody
that&#8217;ll make it fly when you go, I bet. Some
day you&#8217;ll lay down and die and your money&#8217;ll
be scattered. If you leave me any, Becky,&#8221; he
teased her, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put it all in an automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What, them wild things! Road-hogs,
I heard somebody call &#8217;em, and I think it&#8217;s
a good name. My goodness, abody ain&#8217;t safe no
more since they come on the streets. They go toot,
toot, and you got to hop off to one side in the mud
or the ditch, it don&#8217;t matter to them. I hate
them things! Only don&#8217;t never take me to the
graveyard in one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;By that time,&#8221; said Uncle
Amos, &#8220;they&#8217;ll have flyin&#8217; machine
hearses; they&#8217;ll go faster.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, Amos, how you
talk! Ain&#8217;t you ashamed to make fun at your
old sister that way! But Mom always said when you was
little that you seemed a little simple, so I guess
you can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Na-ha,&#8221; exulted Amanda,
with impish delight. &#8220;That&#8217;s one on you.
Aunt Rebecca ain&#8217;t so dumb like she lets on
sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, no,&#8221; Aunt Rebecca
said, laughing. &#8220;&#8217;A blind pig sometimes
finds an acorn, too.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s table, though
not lavishly laden as are those of most of the Pennsylvania
Dutch, was amply filled with good, substantial food.
The fried sausage was browned just right, the potatoes
and lima beans well-cooked, the cold slaw, with its
dash of red peppers, was tasty and the snitz pie--Uncle
Amos&#8217;s favorite--was thick with cinnamon, its
crust flaky and brown.</p>

<p align="left">After the dishes were washed Aunt
Rebecca said, &#8220;Now then, we&#8217;ll go in the
parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, in the parlor!&#8221; exclaimed
Amanda. &#8220;Why, abody&#8217;d think we was company.
You don&#8217;t often take us in the parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, well, you won&#8217;t
make no dirt and I just thought to-day, once, I&#8217;d
take you in the parlor to sit a while. It don&#8217;t
get used hardly. Wait till I open the shutters.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She led the way through a little hall
to the front room. As she opened the door a musty
odor came to the hall.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It smells close,&#8221; said
Aunt Rebecca, sniffing. &#8220;But it&#8217;ll be all
right till I get some screens in.&#8221; She pulled
the tasseled cords of the green shades, opened the
slatted shutters, and a flood of summer light entered
the room. &#8220;Ach,&#8221; she said impatiently as
she hammered at one window, &#8220;I can hardly get
this one open still, it sticks itself so.&#8221; But
after repeated thumps on the frame she succeeded in
raising it and placing an old-fashioned sliding screen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now sit down and take it good,&#8221; she invited.</p>

<p align="left">Uncle Amos sank into an old-fashioned
rocker with high back and curved arms, built throughout
for the solid comfort of its occupants. Mrs. Reist
chose an old hickory Windsor chair, Aunt Rebecca selected,
with a sigh of relief, a fancy reed rocker, given
in exchange for a book of trading stamps.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This here&#8217;s the best
chair in the house and it didn&#8217;t cost a cent,&#8221;
she announced as she rocked in it.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda roamed around the room. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t been in here for long. I want to look
around a little. I like these dishes. I wish we had
some like them.&#8221; She tiptoed before a corner
cupboard filled with antiques.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yes,&#8221; her aunt answered,
&#8220;mebbe it looks funny, ain&#8217;t, to have a
glass cupboard in the parlor, but I had no other room
for it, the house is so little. If I didn&#8217;t
think so much of them dishes I&#8217;d sold them a&#8217;ready.
That little glass with the rim round the bottom of
it I used to drink out of it at my granny&#8217;s
house when I was little. Them dark shiny dishes like
copper were Jonas&#8217;s mom&#8217;s. And I like to
keep the pewter, too, for abody can&#8217;t buy it
these days.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda looked up. On the top shelf
of the cupboard was a silver lustre pitcher, a teapot
of rose lustre, a huge willow platter with its quaint
blue design, several pewter bowls, a plate with a crude
peacock in bright colors--an array of antiques that
would have awakened covetousness in the heart of a
connoisseur.</p>

<p align="left">A walnut pie-crust tilt top table
stood in one corner of the room, a mahogany gateleg
occupied the centre, its beauty largely concealed by
a cover of yellow and white checked homespun linen,
upon which rested a glass oil lamp with a green paper
shade, a wide glass dish filled with pictures, an
old leather-bound album with heavy brass clasps and
hinges. A rag carpet, covered in places with hooked
rugs, added a proper note of harmony, while the old
walnut chairs melted into the whole like trees in
a woodland scene. The whitewashed walls were bare
save for a large square mirror with a wide mahogany
frame, a picture holder made from a palm leaf fan
and a piece of blue velvet briar stitched in yellow,
and a cross-stitch canvas sampler framed with a narrow
braid of horsehair from the tail of a dead favorite
of long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s pewter made of, Aunt Rebecca?&#8221;
asked the child.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, of tin and lead. And it&#8217;s
a pity they don&#8217;t make it and use lots of it
like they used to long ago. For you can use pewter
spoons in vinegar and they don&#8217;t turn black
like some of these things that look like silver but
ain&#8217;t. Pewter is good ware and I think sometimes
that the people that lived when it was used so much
were way ahead of the people to-day. Pewter&#8217;s
the same all through, no thin coatin&#8217; of something
shiny that can wear off and spoil the spoons or dishes.
It&#8217;s old style now but it&#8217;s good and pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s so,&#8221;
agreed Amanda. It was surprising to the little girl
that the acidulous old aunt could, so unexpectedly,
utter beautiful, suggestive thoughts. Oh, Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s
house was a wonderful place. She must see more of
the treasures in the parlor.</p>

<p align="left">Finally her activity annoyed Aunt
Rebecca. &#8220;My goodness,&#8221; came the command,
&#8220;you sit down once! Here, look at the album.
Mebbe that will keep you quiet for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda sat on a low footstool and
took the old album on her knees. She uttered many
delighted squeals of surprise and merriment as she
turned the thick pages and looked at the pictures
of several generations ago. A little girl with ruffled
pantalets showing below her full skirt and a fat little
boy with full trousers reaching half-way between his
knees and his shoetops sent Amanda into a gale of
laughter. &#8220;Oh, I wish Phil was here. What funny
people!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Let me see once,&#8221; asked
Aunt Rebecca. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s Amos and your
mom.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist smiled and Uncle Amos chuckled.
&#8220;We&#8217;re peaches there, ain&#8217;t? I guess
if abody thinks back right you see there were as many
crazy styles in olden times as there is now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Tintypes of men and women in peculiar
dress of Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s youth called forth much
comment and many questions from the interested Amanda.
&#8220;Are there no pictures in here of you?&#8221;
she asked her aunt.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I guess so. On the last
page or near there. That one,&#8221; she said as the
child found it, a tintype of a young man seated on
a vine-covered seat and a comely young woman standing
beside him, one hand laid upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that Uncle Jonas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No--my goodness, no! That&#8217;s Martin Landis.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin Landis? Not my--not
the Martin Landis&#8217;s pop that lives near us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that one.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why"--Amanda was wide-eyed
and curious--"what were you doin&#8217; with your
hand on his shoulder so and your picture taken with
him?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca laughed. &#8220;Ach,
I had dare to do that for we was promised then, engaged
they say now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You were goin&#8217; to marry
Martin Landis&#8217;s pop once?&#8221; The girl could
not quite believe it.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. But he was poor and along
came Jonas Miller and he was rich and I took him.
But the money never done me no good. Mebbe abody shouldn&#8217;t
say it, since he&#8217;s dead, but Jonas was stingy.
He&#8217;d squeeze a dollar till the eagle&#8217;d
holler. He made me pinch and save till I got so I
didn&#8217;t feel right when I spent money. Now, since
he&#8217;s gone, I don&#8217;t know how. I act so
dumb it makes me mad at myself sometimes. If I go to
Lancaster and buy me a whole plate of ice-cream it
kinda bothers me. I keep wonderin&#8217; what Jonas&#8217;d
think, for he used to say that half a plate of cream&#8217;s
enough for any woman. But mebbe it was to be that I
married Jonas instead of Martin Landis. Martin is
a good man but all them children--my goodness! I guess
I got it good alone in my little house long side of
Mrs. Landis with all her children to take care of.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda remembered the glory on the
face of Mrs. Landis as she had said, &#8220;Abody
can have lots of money and yet be poor and others can
have hardly any money and yet be rich. It&#8217;s
all in what abody means by rich and what kind of treasures
you set store by. I wouldn&#8217;t change places with
your rich Aunt Rebecca for all the farms in Lancaster
County.&#8221; Poor Aunt Rebecca, she pitied her!
Then she remembered the words of the memory gem they
had analyzed in school last year, &#8220;Where ignorance
is bliss &#8217;tis folly to be wise.&#8221; She could
understand it now! So long as Aunt Rebecca didn&#8217;t
see what she missed it was all right. But if she ever
woke up and really felt what her life might have been
if she had married the poor man she loved--poor Aunt
Rebecca! A halo of purest romance hung about the old
woman as the child looked up at her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; the woman
broke the spell, &#8220;it&#8217;s funny how old pictures
make abody think back. That old polonaise dress, now,&#8221;
she went on in reminiscent strain, &#8220;had the
nicest buttons on. I got some of &#8217;em yet on
my charm string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charm string--what&#8217;s a charm string?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait once. I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The woman left the room. They heard
her tramp about up-stairs and soon she returned with
a long string of buttons threaded closely together
and forming a heavy cable.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, let me see! Ain&#8217;t
that nice!&#8221; exclaimed Amanda. &#8220;Where did
you ever get so many buttons and all different?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;We used to beg them. When I
was a girl everybody mostly had a charm string. I
kept puttin&#8217; buttons on mine till I was well
up in my twenties, then the string was full and big
so I stopped. I used to hang it over the looking glass
in the parlor and everybody that came looked at it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda fingered the charm string interestedly.
Antique buttons, iridescent, golden, glimmering, some
with carved flowers, others globules of colored glass,
many of them with quaint filigree brass mounting over
colored background, a few G. A. R. buttons from old
uniforms, speckled china ones like portions of bird
eggs--all strung together and each one having a history
to the little old eccentric woman who had cherished
them through many years.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This one Martin Landis give
me for the string and this one is from Jonas&#8217;
wedding jacket and this pretty blue glass one a girl
gave me that&#8217;s dead this long a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh"--Amanda&#8217;s eyes shone.
She turned to her mother, &#8220;Did you ever have
a charm string, Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. A pretty one. But I let
you play with it when you were a baby and the string
got broke and the buttons put in the box or lost.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, but that spites me. I&#8217;d
like to see it and have you tell where the buttons
come from. I like old things like that, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then mebbe you&#8217;d like
to see my friendship cane,&#8221; said Aunt Rebecca.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, yes! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
Amanda rose from her chair, eager to see what a friendship
cane could be.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, sit down! You
get me all hoodled up when you act so jumpy,&#8221;
said the aunt. Then she walked to a corner of the parlor,
reached behind the big cupboard and drew out a cane
upon which were tied some thirty ribbon bows of various
colors.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And is that a friendship cane?&#8221;
asked Amanda. &#8220;What&#8217;s it for?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, it was just such a style,
good for nothin&#8217; but for the girls of my day
to have a little pleasure with. We got boys and girls
to give us pretty ribbons and we exchanged with some
and then we tied &#8217;em on the cane. See, they&#8217;re
all old kinds o&#8217; ribbons yet. Some are double-faced
satin and some with them little scallops at the edge,
and they&#8217;re pretty colors, too. I could tell
the name of every person who give me a ribbon for
that cane. My goodness, lots o&#8217; them boys and
girls been dead long a&#8217;ready. I guess abody
shouldn&#8217;t hold up such old things so long, it
just makes you feel bad still when you rake &#8217;em
out and look at &#8216;em. Here now, let me put it
away, that&#8217;s enough lookin&#8217; for one day.&#8221;
She spoke brusquely and put the cane into its hiding-place
behind the glass cupboard.</p>

<p align="left">As Amanda watched the stern, unlovely
face during the critical, faultfinding conversation
which followed, she thought to herself, &#8220;I just
believe that Uncle Amos told the truth when he said
that Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s like a chestnut burr. She&#8217;s
all prickly on the outside but she&#8217;s got a nice,
smooth side to her that abody don&#8217;t often get
the chance to see. Mebbe now, if she&#8217;d married
Martin Landis&#8217;s pop she&#8217;d be by now just
as nice as Mrs. Landis. It wonders me now if she would!&#8221;</p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h1>

<h2 align="center">School Days</h2>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist&#8217;s desire for a happy
childhood for her children was easily realized, especially
in the case of Amanda. She had the happy faculty of
finding joy in little things, things commonly called
insignificant. She had a way of taking to herself
each beauty of nature, each joy note of the birds,
the airy loveliness of the clouds, and being thrilled
by them.</p>

<p align="left">With Phil and Martin Landis--and the
ubiquitous Landis baby--she explored every field,
woods and roadside in the Crow Hill section of the
county. From association with her Phil and Martin had
developed an equal interest in outdoors. The Landis
boy often came running into the Reist yard calling
for Amanda and exclaiming excitedly, &#8220;I found
a bird&#8217;s nest! It&#8217;s an oriole this time,
the dandiest thing way out on the end of a tiny twig.
Come on see it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda was the moving spirit of that
little group of nature students. Phil and Martin might
have never known an oriole from a thrush if she had
not led them along the path of knowledge. Sometimes
some of the intermediate Landis children joined the
group. At times Lyman Mertzheimer sauntered along
and invited himself, but his interest was feigned
and his welcome was not always cordial.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You Lyman Mertzheimer,&#8221;
Amanda said to him one day, &#8220;if you want to go
along to see birds&#8217; nests you got to keep quiet!
You think it&#8217;s smart to scare them off the nests.
That poor thrasher, now, that you scared last week!
You had her heart thumpin&#8217; so her throat most
burst. And her with her nest right down on the ground
where we could watch the babies if we kept quiet.
You&#8217;re awful mean!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Huh,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;what&#8217;s
a bird! All this fuss about a dinky brown bird that
can&#8217;t do anything but flop its wings and squeal
when you go near it. It was fun to see her flop all
around the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, you nasty mean thing, Lyman
Mertzheimer"--for a moment Amanda found no words to
express her contempt of him--"sometimes I just hate
you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He went off laughing, flinging back
the prediction, &#8220;But some day you&#8217;ll do
the reverse, Amanda Reist.&#8221; He felt secure in
the belief that he could win the love of any girl
he chose if he exerted himself to do so.</p>

<p align="left">The little country school of Crow
Hill was necessarily limited in its curriculum, hence
when Amanda expressed a desire to become a teacher
it was decided to send her to the Normal School at
Millersville. At that time she was sixteen and was
grown into an attractive girl.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I know I&#8217;m not beautiful,&#8221;
she told her mother one day after a long, searching
survey in the mirror. &#8220;My hair is too screaming
red, but then it&#8217;s fluffy and I got a lot of
it. Add to red hair a nose that&#8217;s a little pug
and a mouth that&#8217;s a little too big and I guess
the combination won&#8217;t produce any Cleopatra
or any Titian beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But you forgot the eyes,&#8221;
her mother said tenderly. &#8220;They are pretty brown
and look--ach, I can&#8217;t put it in fine words like
you could, but I mean this: Your eyes are such honest
eyes and always look so happy, like you could see
through dark places and find the light and could look
on wicked people and see the good in them and be glad
about it. You keep that look in your eyes and no pretty
girl will be lovelier that you are, Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother,&#8221; the girl cried
after she had kissed the white-capped woman, &#8220;if
my eyes shine it&#8217;s the faith and love you taught
me that&#8217;s shining in them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">During the summer preceding Amanda&#8217;s
departure for school there was pleasant excitement
at the Reist farm. Millie was proud of the fact that
Amanda was &#8220;goin&#8217; to Millersville till
fall&#8221; and lost no oppor-tunity to mention it
whenever a friend or neighbor dropped in for a chat.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca did not approve of too
much education. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; she put it,
&#8220;you&#8217;re spendin&#8217; your own money for
this Millersville goin&#8217;, but I think you&#8217;d
do better if you put it to bank and give it to Amanda
when she gets married, once. This here rutchin&#8217;
round to school so long is all for nothin&#8217;.
I guess she&#8217;s smart enough to teach country school
without goin&#8217; to Millersville yet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">However, her protests fell heedlessly
on the ears of those most concerned and when the preparation
of new clothes began Aunt Rebecca was the first to
offer her help. &#8220;It&#8217;s all for nothin&#8217;,
this school learnin&#8217;, but if she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
anyhow I can just as well as not help with the sewin&#8217;,&#8221;
she announced and spent a few weeks at the Reist farm,
giving valuable aid in the making of Amanda&#8217;s
school outfit.</p>

<p align="left">Those two weeks were long ones to
Philip, who had scant patience with the querulous
old aunt. But Amanda, since she had glimpsed the girlhood
romance of the woman, had a kindlier feeling for her
and could smile at the faultfinding or at least run
away from it without retort if it became too vexatious.</p>

<p align="left">Crow Hill was only an hour&#8217;s
ride from the school at Millersville, so Amanda spent
most of her weekends at home. Each time she had wonderful
tales to tell, at least they seemed wonderful to the
little group at the Reist farmhouse. Mrs. Reist and
Uncle Amos, denied in their youth of more than a very
meagre education, took just pride in the girl who
was pursuing the road to knowledge. Philip, boylike,
expressed no pride in his sister, but he listened attentively
to her stories of how the older students played pranks
on the newcomers. Millie was proud of having <i>our
Amanda</i> away at school and did not hesitate to
express her pride. She felt sure that before the girl&#8217;s
three years&#8217; course was completed the name of
Amanda Reist would shine above all others on the pages
of the Millersville Normal School records.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve learned a few
things about human nature,&#8221; said Amanda on her
second visit home. &#8220;You know I told you last
week how nice the older girls are to the new ones.
A crowd of Seniors came into our room the other day
and they were lovely! One of them told me she adored
red hair and she just knew all the girls were going
to love me because I have such a sweet face and I&#8217;m
so dear--she emphasized every other word! I wondered
what ailed her. She didn&#8217;t know me well enough
to talk like that. Before they left she began to talk
about the Page Literary Society--&#8217;Dear, we&#8217;re
all Pageites, and it&#8217;s the best, finest society
in the school. We do have such good times. You ought
to join. All the very nicest girls of the school are
in it.&#8217; I promised to think it over. Well, soon
after they left another bunch of girls came into our
room and they were just as sweet to us. By and by one
of them said, &#8217;Dear, we&#8217;re all in the
Normal Literary Society. It&#8217;s the best society
in the school; all the very nicest girls belong to
it. You should join it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ha, electioneering, was they!&#8221;
said Uncle Amos, laughing. &#8220;Well, leave it to
the women. When they get the vote once we men got to
pony up. But which society did you join?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Neither. I&#8217;m going to
wait a while and while I&#8217;m waiting I&#8217;m
having a glorious time. The Pageites invited me to
a fudge party one night, the Normalites took me for
a long walk, a Pageite treated me to icecream soda
one day and a Normalite gave me some real home-made
cake the same afternoon. It&#8217;s great to be on
the fence when both sides are coaxing you to jump
their way.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Millie, her
face glowing with interest and pride in the girl,
&#8220;if you ain&#8217;t the funniest! I just bet
them girls all want you to come their way. But what
kind o&#8217; meals do you get?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good, Millie. Of course, though,
I haven&#8217;t any cellar to go to for pie or any
cooky crock filled with sand-tarts with shellbarks
on the top.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, Manda.
I&#8217;ll make you sand-tarts and lemon pie and everything
you like every time you come home still.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Millie, you good soul! With
that promise to help me I&#8217;ll work like a Trojan
and win some honors at old M.S.N.S. Just watch me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda did work. She brought to her
studies the same whole-hearted interest and enthusiasm
she evinced in her hunts for wild flowers, she applied
to them the same dogged determination and untiring
efforts she showed in her long search for hidden bird
nests, with the inevitable result that her brain,
naturally alert and brilliant, grasped with amazing
celerity both the easy and the hard lessons of the
Normal Training course.</p>

<p align="left">Millie&#8217;s prediction proved well
founded--Amanda Reist stood well in her classes. In
botany she was the preeminent figure of the entire
school. &#8220;Ask Amanda Reist, she&#8217;ll tell
you,&#8221; became the slogan among the students.
&#8220;Yellow violets, lady-slippers, wild ginger--she&#8217;ll
tell you where they grow or get a specimen for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When the time for graduation drew
near Amanda was able to carry home the glad news that
she ranked third in her class and was chosen to deliver
an oration at the Commencement exercises.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That I want to hear,&#8221;
declared Millie, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll get a new dress
to wear to it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">On the June morning when the Commencement
exercises of the First Pennsylvania State Normal School
took place there were hundreds of happy, eager visitors
on the campus at Millersville, and later in the great
auditorium, but none was happier than Millie Hess,
Reists&#8217; hired girl. The new dress, bought in
Lancaster and made by Mrs. Reist and Aunt Rebecca,
was a white lawn flecked with black. Millie had decided
on a plain waist with high neck, the inch wide band
at the throat edged with torchon lace, after the style
she usually wore, the skirt made full and having above
the hem, as Millie put it, &#8220;Just a few tucks,
then wait a while, then tucks again.&#8221; But Amanda,
happening on the scene as the dress was tried on,
protested at the high neck.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Please, Millie,&#8221; she
coaxed, &#8220;do have the neck turned down, oh, just
a little! I&#8217;d have a nice pleated ruffle of
white net around it and a little V in front. You&#8217;d
look fine that way.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Me-fine! Go long with you,
Amanda Reist! Ain&#8217;t I got two good eyes and
a lookin&#8217;-glass? But I guess I would look more
like other folks if I had it made like you say. But
now I don&#8217;t want it too low. You dare fix it
so it looks right.&#8221; Displaying the same meek
acquiescence in the desire of Amanda she bought a
stylish hat instead of the big flat sailor with its
taffeta bow she generally chose. The hat was Amanda&#8217;s
selection, a small, modest little thing with pale pink
and gray roses misty with a covering of black tulle.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Me with pink roses on my hat
and over forty years old,&#8221; said Millie wonderingly,
but when she tried it on and saw the improvement in
her appearance she smiled happily. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the prettiest hat I ever had and I&#8217;ll hold it
up and take good care of it so it&#8217;ll last me
years. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; fixed up for sure once,
only my new shoes don&#8217;t have no squeak in &#8217;em
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s out of style,&#8221; Amanda informed
her kindly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It is? Why, when I was little
I remember hearin&#8217; folks tell how when they
bought new shoes they always asked for a &#8216;fib&#8217;s
worth of squeak&#8217; in &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And now they pay the shoemaker
more than a &#8216;fib&#8217; to put a few pegs in
the shoes and take the squeak out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, well, how things get
different! But then I&#8217;m glad mine don&#8217;t
make no noise if that&#8217;s the way now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Commencement day Millie could have
held her own with any well-dressed city woman. Her
plain face was almost beautiful as she stood ready
for the great event of Amanda&#8217;s life. At the
last moment she thought of the big bush of shrubs
in the yard--"I must get me a shrub to smell in the
Commencement,&#8221; she decided. So she gathered one
of the queer-looking, fragrant brown blossoms, tied
it in the corner of her handkerchief and bruised it
gently so that the sweet perfume might be exuded. &#8220;Um-ah,&#8221;
she breathed in the odor, &#8220;now I&#8217;m ready
for Millersville.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As she stood with Mrs. Reist and Philip
on the front porch waiting for Uncle Amos she said
to Mrs. Reist, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Amanda fixed me up
fine? Abody&#8217;d hardly know me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist in her plain gray Mennonite
dress and stiff black silk bonnet was, as usual, an
attractive figure. Philip, grown to the dignity of
long trousers, carried himself with all the poise of
seventeen. He was now a student in the Lancaster High
School and had he not learned to dress and act like
city boys do! Uncle Amos, in his best Sunday suit
of gray, his Mennonite hat in his hand, ambled along
last as the little group went down the aisle of the
Millersville chapel to see Amanda&#8217;s graduation.</p>

<p align="left">As Amanda marched in, her red hair
parted on the side and coiled into a womanly coiffure,
wearing a simple white organdie, she was just one of
the hundred graduates who marched into the chapel.
But later, as she stood alone on the platform and
delivered her oration, &#8220;The Flowers of the Garden
Spot,&#8221; she held the interested attention of all
in that vast audience. She knew her subject and succeeded
in waking in the hearts of her hearers a desire to
go out in the green fields and quiet woods and find
the lovely habitants of the flower world.</p>

<p align="left">After it was all over and she stood,
shining-eyed and happy, among her own people in the
chapel, Martin Landis joined them. He, too, had left
childhood behind. The serious gravity of his new estate
was deepened in his face, but the same tenderness
that had soothed the numerous Landis babies also still
dwelt there. One of the regrets of his heart was the
fact that nature had denied him great stature. He had
always dreamed of growing into a tall man, powerful
in physique, like Lyman Mertzheimer. But nature was
obstinate and Martin Landis reached manhood, a strong,
sturdy being, but of medium height. His mother tried
to assuage his disappointment by asserting that even
if his stature was not great as he wished his heart
was big enough to make up for it. He tried to live
up to her valuation of him, but it was scant comfort
as he stood in the presence of physically big men.
Life had not dealt generously with him as with Amanda
in the matter of education. He wanted a chance to study
at some institution higher than the little school at
Crow Hill but his father needed him on the farm. The
elder man was subject to attacks of rheumatism and
at such times the brunt of farm labor fell upon the
shoulders of Martin.</p>

<p align="left">Money was scarce in the Landis household,
there were so many mouths to feed and it seemed to
Martin that he would never have the opportunity to
do anything but work in the fields from early spring
to late autumn, snatch a few months for study in a
business college in Lancaster, then go back again
to the ploughing and arduous duties of his father&#8217;s
farm. He thought enviously of Lyman Mertzheimer, whose
father had sent him to a well-known preparatory school
and then started him in a full course in one of the
leading universities of the country. If he had a chance
like that! If he could only get away from the farm
long enough to earn some money he knew he could work
his way through school and fit himself for some position
he would like better than farming. Some such thoughts
ran through his brain as he went to congratulate Amanda
on her graduation day.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Martin!&#8221; she greeted
him cordially. &#8220;So you got here, after all.
I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So am I. I wouldn&#8217;t have
missed that oration for a great deal. I could smell
the arbutus--say, it was great, Amanda!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Lyman Mertzheimer joined them.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Congratulations, Amanda,&#8221;
he said in his affected manner. As the good-looking
son of a wealthy man he credited himself with the possession
of permissible pride. &#8220;Congratulations,&#8221;
he repeated, ignoring the smaller man who stood by
the side of the girl. &#8220;Your oration was beautifully
rendered. You were very eloquent, but if you will pardon
me, I&#8217;d like to remind you of one flower you
forgot to mention--a very important flower of the
Garden Spot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I did?&#8221; she said as though
it were a negligible matter. &#8220;What was the flower
I forgot?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda Reist,&#8221; he said,
and laughed at his supposed cleverness.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied, vexed
at his words and his bold attitude, &#8220;I left
that out purposely along with some of the weeds of
the Garden Spot I might have mentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Meaning me?&#8221; He lifted
his eyebrows in question. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really
mean that, Amanda.&#8221; He spoke in winning voice.
&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t mean that so I won&#8217;t
quarrel with you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I guess you better not!&#8221;
spoke up Millie who had listened to all that was said.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to get our Amanda cross
on this here day. She done fine in that speech and
we&#8217;re proud of her and don&#8217;t want you
nor no one else to go spoil it by any fuss.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see you have more than one
champion, Amanda. I&#8217;ll have to be very careful
how I speak to you.&#8221; He laughed but a glare of
anger shone in his eyes.</p>

<p align="left">A few moments later the little party
broke up and Lyman went off alone. A storm raged within
him--"A hired girl to speak to me like that--a common
hired girl! I&#8217;ll teach her her place when I marry
Amanda. And Amanda was high and mighty to-day. Thought
she owned the world because she graduated from Millersville!
As though that&#8217;s anything! She&#8217;s the kind
needs a strong hand, a master hand. And I&#8217;ll
be the master! I like her kind, the women who have
spirit and fire. But she needs to be held under, subjected
by a stronger spirit. That little runt of a Martin
Landis was hanging round her, too. He has no show when
I&#8217;m in the running. He&#8217;s poor and has
no education. He&#8217;s just a clodhopper.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Meanwhile the clodhopper had also
said good-bye to Amanda. For some reason he did not
stop to analyze, the heart of Martin Landis was light
as he went home from the Commencement at Millersville.
He had always detested Lyman Mertzheimer, for he had
felt too often the snubs and taunts of the rich boy.
Amanda&#8217;s rebuff of the arrogant youth pleased
Martin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I like Amanda,&#8221; he thought
frankly, but he never went beyond that in the analysis
of his feelings for the comrade of his childhood and
young boyhood. &#8220;I like her and I&#8217;d hate
to see her waste her time on a fellow like Lyman Mertzheimer.
I&#8217;m glad she squelched him. Perhaps some day
he&#8217;ll find there are still some desirable things
that money can&#8217;t buy.&#8221;</p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VII</h1>

<h2 align="center">Amanada Reist, Teacher</h2>

<p align="left">Amanda had no desire to teach far
from her home. &#8220;I want to see the whole United
States if I live long enough,&#8221; she declared,
&#8220;but I want to travel through the distant parts
of it, not settle there to live. While I have a home
I want to stay near it. So I wish I could get a school
in Lancaster County.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Her wish was granted. There was an
opening in Crow Hill, in the little rural school in
which she had received the rudiments of her education.
Amanda applied for the position and was elected.</p>

<p align="left">She brought to that little school
several innovations. Her love and knowledge of nature
helped her to make the common studies less monotonous
and more interesting. A Saturday afternoon nutting
party with her pupils afforded a more promising subject
for Monday&#8217;s original composition than the hackneyed
suggestions of the grammar book&#8217;s &#8220;Tell
all you know about the cultivation of coffee.&#8221;
Later, snow forts in the school-yard impressed the
children with the story of Ticonderoga more indelibly
than mere reading about it could have done. During
her last year at Normal, Amanda had read about a school
where geography was taught by the construction of
miniature islands, capes, straits, peninsulas, and
so forth, in the school-yard. She directed the older
children in the formation of such a landscape picture.
When a blundering boy slipped and with one bare foot
demolished at one stroke the cape, island and bay,
there was much merriment and rivalry for the honor
of rebuilding. The children were almost unanimous in
their affection for the new teacher and approval of
her methods of teaching. Most of them ran home with
eager tales concerning the wonderful, funny, &#8220;nice&#8221;
ways Miss Reist had of teaching school.</p>

<p align="left">However, Crow Hill is no Eden. Some
of the older boys laughed at the &#8220;silly ideas&#8221;
of &#8220;that Manda Reist&#8221; and disliked the
way she taught geography and made the pupils &#8220;play
in the dirt and build capes and islands and the whole
blamed geography business right in the school-yard.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">It naturally followed that adverse
criticism grew and grew, like Longfellow&#8217;s pumpkin,
and many curious visitors came to Crow Hill school.
The patrons, taxpayers, directors were concerned and
considered it their duty to drop in and observe how
things were being run in that school. They found that
the three R&#8217;s were still taught efficiently,
even if they were taught with the aid of chestnuts,
autumn leaves and flowers; they were glad to discover
that an island, though formed in the school-yard from
dirt and water, was still being defined with the old
standard definition, &#8220;An island is a body of
land entirely surrounded by water.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">If any other school had graduated
Amanda, her position might have been a trifle precarious,
but Millersville Normal School was too well known
and universally approved in Lancaster County to admit
of any questionable suggestions about its recent graduate.
Most of the people who came to inspect came without
any antagonistic feeling and they left convinced that,
although some of Amanda Reist&#8217;s ways were a little
different, the scholars seemed to know their lessons
and to progress satisfactorily.</p>

<p align="left">Later in the school year she urged
the children to bring dried corn husk to school, she
brought brightly colored raffia, and taught them how
to make baskets. The children were clamorous for more
knowledge of basket making. The fascinating task of
forming objects of beauty and usefulness from homely
corn husk and a few gay threads of raffia was novel
to them. Amanda was willing to help the children along
the path of manual dexterity and eager to have them
see and love the beautiful. Under her guidance they
gathered and pressed weeds and grasses and the airy,
elusive milkweed down, caught butterflies, and assembled
the whole under glass, thus making beautiful trays
and pictures.</p>

<p align="left">On the whole it was a wonderful, happy
year for the new teacher of the Crow Hill school.
When spring came with all the alluring witchery of
the Garden Spot it seemed to her she must make every
one of her pupils feel the thrill of the song-sparrow&#8217;s
first note and the matchless loveliness of the anemone.</p>

<p align="left">One day in early April, the last week
of school, as she locked the door of the schoolhouse
and started down the road to her home an unusual glow
of satisfaction beamed on her face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Only two more days of school,
then the big Spelling Bee to wind it up and then my
first year&#8217;s teaching will be over! I have enjoyed
it but I&#8217;m like the children--eager for vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She hummed gaily as she went along,
this nineteen-year-old school teacher so near the
end of her first year&#8217;s work in the schoolroom.
Her eyes roved over the fair panorama of Lancaster
County in early spring dress. As she neared the house
she saw her Uncle Amos resting under a giant sycamore
tree that stood in the front yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good times,&#8221; she called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Manda,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re
home early.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Early--it&#8217;s half-past
four. Have you been asleep and lost track of the time?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He took a big silver watch from a
pocket and whistled as he looked at it. &#8220;Whew!
It is that late! Time for me to get to work again.
Your Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Dear me! And I felt so happy!
Now I&#8217;ll get a call-down about something or
other. I&#8217;m ashamed of myself, Uncle Amos, but
I think Aunt Rebecca gets worse as she grows older.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;&#8217;Fraid so,&#8221; the
man agreed soberly. &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t all
be alike. Too bad, now, she don&#8217;t take after
me, eh, Amanda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely is! You&#8217;re the nicest man I
know!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hold on now,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;next you make me blush. I ain&#8217;t used to
gettin&#8217; compliments.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But I mean it. I don&#8217;t
see how she can be your sister and Mother&#8217;s!
I think the fairies must have mixed babies when she
was little. I can see many good qualities in her,
but there&#8217;s no need of her being so contrary
and critical. I remember how I used to be half afraid
of her when I was little. She tried to make Mother
dress me in a plain dress and a Mennonite bonnet,
but Mother said she&#8217;d dress me like a little
girl and if I chose I could wear the plain dress and
bonnet when I was old enough to know what it means.
Oh, Mother&#8217;s wonderful! If I had Aunt Rebecca
for a mother--but perhaps she&#8217;d be different
then. Oh, Uncle Amos, do you remember the howl she
raised when we had our house wired for electricity?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Glory, yes! She was scared
to death to come here for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And Phil wickedly suggested
we scare her again! But she was afraid of it. She
was sure the house would be struck by lightning the
first thunder-storm we&#8217;d have. And when we put
the bath tub into the house-- whew! Didn&#8217;t she
give us lectures then! She has no use for &#8216;swimmin&#8217;
tubs&#8217; to this day. If folks can&#8217;t wash
clean out of a basin they must be powerful dirty!
That&#8217;s her opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Both laughed at the remembrance of
the old woman&#8217;s words. Then the girl asked,
&#8220;What did she have to say to you to-day? Did
she iron any wrinkles out of you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I got it a&#8217;ready.&#8221;
The man chuckled. &#8220;I was plantin&#8217; potatoes
till my back was near broke and I came in to rest
a little and get a drink. She told me it&#8217;s funny
people got to rest so often in these days when they
do a little work. She worked in the fields often and
she could stand more yet than a lot o&#8217; lazy
men. I didn&#8217;t answer her but I came out here
and got my rest just the same. She ain&#8217;t bossin&#8217;
her brother Amos yet! But now I got to work faster
for this doin&#8217; nothin&#8217; under the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When Amanda entered the kitchen she
found her mother and the visitor cutting carpet rags.
Old clothes were falling under the snip of the shears
into a peach basket, ready to be sewn together, wound
into balls and woven into rag carpet by the local
carpet weaver on his hand loom.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the girl
as she laid a few books on the kitchen table.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Books again,&#8221; sniffed
Aunt Rebecca. &#8220;I wonder now how much money gets
spent for books that ain&#8217;t necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lots of it,&#8221; answered the girl cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph, did you buy those?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when I went to Millersville.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, what a lot o&#8217;
money goes for such things these days! There&#8217;s
books about everything, somebody told me. There&#8217;s
even some wrote about the Pennsylvania Dutch and about
that there Stiegel glass some folks make such a fuss
about. I don&#8217;t see nothin&#8217; in that Stiegel
glass to make it so dear. Why, I had a little white
glass pitcher, crooked it was, too, and nothin&#8217;
extra to look at. But along come one of them anteak
men, so they call themselves, the men that buy up old
things. Anyhow, he offered to give me a dollar for
that little pitcher. Ach, I didn&#8217;t care much
for it, though it was Jonas&#8217;s granny&#8217;s
still. I sold it to that man quick before he&#8217;d
change his mind and mebbe only give me fifty cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sold it?&#8221; asked Amanda. &#8220;And
was it this shape?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a swift, crude sketch of the well-known Stiegel
pitcher shape.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness, you drawed one just like it! It
looked like that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then, Aunt Rebecca, you gave
that man a bargain. That was a real Stiegel pitcher
and worth much more than a dollar!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, what did I do
now! You mean it was worth <i>more</i> than that?&#8221;
The woman was incredulous.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You might have gotten five,
perhaps ten, dollars for it in the city. You know
Stiegel glass was some of the first to be made in this
country, made in Manheim, Pennsylvania, way back in
1760, or some such early date as that. It was crude
as to shape, almost all the pieces are a little crooked,
but it was wonderfully made in some ways, for it has
a ring like a bell, and the loveliest fluting, and
some of it is in beautiful blue, green and amethyst.
Stiegel glass is rare and valuable so if you have
any more hold on to it and I&#8217;ll buy it from you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I guess! I wouldn&#8217;t
leave you pay five dollars for a glass pitcher! But
I wish I had that one back. It spites me now I sold
it. My goodness, abody can&#8217;t watch out enough
so you won&#8217;t get cheated. Where did you learn
so much about that old glass?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I read about it in a <i>book</i>
last year,&#8221; came the ready answer.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca looked at the girl, but
Amanda&#8217;s face bore so innocent an expression
that the woman could not think her guilty of emphasizing
the word purposely.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So,&#8221; the visitor said,
&#8220;they did put something worth in a book once!
Well, I guess it&#8217;s time you learn something that&#8217;ll
help you save money. All the books you got to read!
And Philip&#8217;s still goin&#8217; to school, too.
Why don&#8217;t he help Amos on the farm instead of
runnin&#8217; to Lancaster to school?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He wants to be a lawyer,&#8221;
said Mrs. Reist. &#8220;I think still that as long
as he has a good head for learnin&#8217; and wants
to go to school I should leave him go till he&#8217;s
satisfied. I think his pop would say so if he was
livin&#8217;. Not everybody takes to farmin&#8217;
and it is awful hard work. Amos works that hard.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Poof,&#8221; said Aunt Rebecca,
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t heard tell yet of any man workin&#8217;
himself to death! It wouldn&#8217;t hurt Philip to
be a farmer. The trouble is it don&#8217;t sound tony
enough for the young ones these days. Lawyer-- what
does he want to be a lawyer for? I heard a&#8217;ready
that they are all liars. You&#8217;re by far too easy!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Aunt Rebecca,&#8221; said
Amanda, &#8220;not all lawyers are liars. Abraham
Lincoln was a lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I guess he was no different
from others, only he&#8217;s dead so abody shouldn&#8217;t
talk about him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda sighed and turned to her mother.
&#8220;Mother, I&#8217;m going up to put on an old
dress and when Phil comes we&#8217;re going over to
the woods for arbutus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But the aunt did not consider it all
right. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you help cut carpet
rags?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;That would be more sense
than runnin&#8217; out after flowers that wither right
aways.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;If we find any, Millie is going
to take them to market to-morrow and sell them. Some
people asked for them last week. It&#8217;s rather
early but we may find some on the sunny side of the
woods.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the woman was mollified,
&#8220;if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to sell &#8217;em
that&#8217;s different. Ain&#8217;t it funny anybody
<i>buys</i> flowers? But then some people don&#8217;t
know how to spend their money and will buy anything,
just so it&#8217;s buyin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But Amanda was off to the wide stairs,
beyond the sound of the haranguing voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Glory!&#8221; she said to herself
when she reached her room. &#8220;If my red hair didn&#8217;t
bristle! What a life we&#8217;d have if Mother were
like that! If I ever think I have nothing to be thankful
for I&#8217;m going to remember that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">A little while later she went down
the stairs, out through the yard and down the country
road to meet her brother. She listened for his whistle.
In childhood he had begun the habit of whistling a
strain from the old song, &#8220;Soldier&#8217;s Farewell&#8221;
and, like many habits of early years, it had clung
to him. So when Amanda heard the plaintive melody,
&#8220;How can I leave thee, how can I from thee part,&#8221;
she knew that her brother was either arriving or leaving.</p>

<p align="left">As she walked down the road in the
April sunshine the old whistle floated to her. She
hastened her steps and in a bend in the road came
face to face with the boy.</p>

<p align="left">At sight of her he stopped whistling,
whipped off his cap and greeted her, &#8220;Hello,
Sis. I thought that would bring you if you were about.
Oh, don&#8217;t look so tickled over my politeness--I
just took off my hat because I&#8217;m hot. This walk
from the trolley on a day like this warms you up.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">His words brought a light push from
the girl as she took her place beside him and they
walked on.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s a mournful whistle
for a home-coming,&#8221; Amanda told him. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you find a more appropriate one?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My repertoire is limited, sister--I
learned that big word in English class to-day and
had to try it out on some one.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Phil, you&#8217;re crazy!&#8221;
was the uncomplimentary answer, but her eyes smiled
with pride upon the tall, red-haired boy beside her.
&#8220;I see it&#8217;s one of your giddy days so
I&#8217;ll sober you up a bit--Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s
at the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yea!&#8221; He held his side in mock agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again? What&#8217;s the row now? Any curtain
lectures?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Be comforted, Phil. She&#8217;s
going home to-night if you&#8217;ll drive her to Landisville.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Won&#8217;t I though!&#8221;
he said, with the average High School boy&#8217;s disregard
of pure English. &#8220;Surest thing you know, Sis,
I&#8217;ll drive her home or anywhere else. What&#8217;s
she doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helping Mother cut carpet rags.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the only
redeeming feature about her. She does help Mother.
Aunt Rebecca isn&#8217;t lazy. I&#8217;m glad to be
able to say one nice thing about her. Apart from that
she&#8217;s generally as Millie says, &#8216;actin&#8217;
like she ate wasps.&#8217; But she can&#8217;t scare
me. All her ranting goes in one ear and out the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing there to stop it, eh, Phil?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda! That from you! Now
I know how Caesar felt when he saw Brutus with the
mob.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of &#8216;Cheer
up, the worst is yet to come,&#8217; I suppose, so
you might as well smile.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">In this manner they bantered until
they reached the Reist farmhouse. There the boy greeted
the visitor politely, as his sister had done.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; was the
aunt&#8217;s greeting to him, &#8220;you got an armful
of books, too!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m going to be
a lawyer, but I have to do a lot of hard studying
before I get that far.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Umph, that&#8217;s nothin&#8217;
to brag about. I&#8217;d think more of you if you
stayed home and helped Amos plant corn and potatoes
or tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d never plant tobacco.
Chewing and smoking are filthy habits and I&#8217;d
never have the stuff grow on any farm I owned.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But the money, Philip, just
think once of the money tobacco brings! But, ach,
it&#8217;s for no use talkin&#8217; farm to you. You
got nothin&#8217; but books in your head. How do you
suppose this place is goin&#8217; to be run about
ten years from now if Amanda teaches and you turn lawyer?
Amos is soon too old to work it and you can&#8217;t
depend on hired help. Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Search me,&#8221; said the
boy inelegantly. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not worrying
about it. We may not want to live here ten years from
now. But, Mother,&#8221; he veered suddenly, &#8220;got
any pie left from dinner? I&#8217;m hungry. May I
forage?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Help yourself, Philip. There&#8217;s
a piece of cherry pie and a slice of chocolate cake
in the cellar.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hurray, Mother! I&#8217;m going
to see that you get an extra star in your crown some
day for feeding the hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But you spoil him,&#8221; said
Aunt Rebecca as Phil went off to the cellar. &#8220;And
if that boy ain&#8217;t always after pie! I mind how
he used to eat pie when he was little and you brought
him to see us. Not that I grudged him the pie, but
I remember how he always took two pieces if he got
it. And pie ain&#8217;t good for him, neither, between
meals.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I guess it won&#8217;t hurt
him,&#8221; said Mrs. Reist; &#8220;the boy&#8217;s
growin&#8217; and he has just a lunch at noon, so
he gets hungry till he walks in from the trolley.
Boys like pie. His father was a great hand for pie.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the aunt
decisively, &#8220;I would never spoiled children if
I had any. But I had none.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Thank goodness!&#8221; Amanda
breathed to herself as she went out to the porch to
wait for her brother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um, that pie was good,&#8221;
was his verdict as he joined her. &#8220;But say,
Sis, didn&#8217;t you hear the squirrels chatter in
there?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come on.&#8221; Amanda laughed
as she swung the basket to her arm and pulled eagerly
at the sleeve of the boy&#8217;s coat. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go after the flowers and forget all about her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Along the Crow Hill schoolhouse runs
a long spur of wooded hills skirting the country road
for a quarter of a mile and stretching away into denser
timberland. In those woods were the familiar paths
Amanda and Phil loved to traverse in search of flowers.
In April, when the first warm, sunshiny days came,
the ground under the dead leaves of the overshadowing
oaks was carpeted with arbutus. Eager children soon
found those near the crude rail fence, but Amanda
and Phil followed the narrow trails to the secluded
sheltered spots where the May flowers had not been
touched that spring.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No roots, Phil!&#8221; warned
the girl as they knelt in the brown leaves and pushed
away the covering from the fragrant blossoms.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Sure thing not, Sis! We don&#8217;t
want to exterminate the trailing arbutus in Crow Hill.
Say, I passed two kids this morning as I was going
to the trolley. They had a bunch of arbutus, roots
and all. Believe me, I acted up like Aunt Rebecca
for about two minutes. But it&#8217;s a shame to take
the roots. I almost hate to pick the flowers--seems
as if they&#8217;re at home here in the woods--belong
here, in a way.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking
about, Phil; that little verse:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8217;Hast thou named all the birds without
a gun?<br>
&#160;&#160;Loved the wood-rose and left it on its
stalk?<br>
&#160;&#160;Oh, be my friend, and teach me to be thine.&#8217;</p>

<p align="left">I agree with the first half of the
requirement, but the latter half can&#8217;t always
be followed. At any rate, the wild rose is better left
on the stem, for it withers when plucked. But with
arbutus it&#8217;s different. Why, Phil, some of the
people who come to market and buy our wild flowers
would never see any if they could not buy them in the
city. Imagine, if you can, yourself living in a big
city, far away from Crow Hill, where the Mayflowers
grow--Philadelphia or New York, or some such formidable-sounding
place. The city might engross your attention so you&#8217;d
be happy for months. But along comes spring with its
call to the woods and meadows. Still the city and
its demands grip you like a vise, and you can&#8217;t
run away to where the wild green things are pushing
to the light. Suppose you saw a flower-stand and a
tiny bunch of arbutus--&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d pay my last dollar
for them!&#8221; declared Philip. &#8220;Guess you&#8217;re
right. According to your reasoning, we&#8217;re as
good as missionaries when we find wild flowers and
take or send them to the city market to sell. Aunt
Rebecca wouldn&#8217;t see that. She&#8217;d see the
money end of it. Poor soul! I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m
not like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pharisee,&#8221; chided his sister.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, do you know, Manda, sometimes
I think there&#8217;s something to be said in favor
of the Pharisee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gave him a quizzical look.</p>

<p align="left">The serious and the light were so
strangely mingled in the boy&#8217;s nature. Amanda
caught many glimpses into the recesses of his heart,
recesses he knew she would not try to explore deeper
than he wished. For the natures of brother and sister
were strongly similar--light-hearted and happy, laughing
and gay, keen to enjoy life, but reading some part
of its mysteries, understanding some of its sorrows
and showing at times evidences of searching thought
and grave retrospect.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;How many dollars&#8217; worth
do we have?&#8221; the boy asked in imitation of Aunt
Rebecca&#8217;s mercenary way.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Phil! You&#8217;re dreadful!
But I bet the flowers will be gone in no time when
Millie puts them out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d wager they&#8217;d
go faster if you sold them,&#8221; he replied, looking
admiringly at the girl. &#8220;You&#8217;d be a pretty
fair peddler of flowers, Sis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Phil, be sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I mean it, Amanda. You&#8217;re
not so bad looking. Your hair isn&#8217;t common red,
it&#8217;s Titian. And it&#8217;s fluffy. Then your
eyes are good and your complexion lacks the freckles
you ought to have. Your nose isn&#8217;t Grecian,
but it&#8217;ll do--we&#8217;ll call it retrouss&#233;,
for that sounds nicer than pug. And your mouth--well,
it&#8217;s not exactly a rosebud one, but it doesn&#8217;t
mar the general landscape like some mouths do. Altogether,
you&#8217;re real good-looking, even if you are my
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Philip Reist, you&#8217;re
impertinent! But I suppose you are truthful. That&#8217;s
a doubtful compliment you&#8217;re giving me, but I&#8217;m
glad to say your veracity augurs well for your success
as a lawyer. If you are always as honest as in that
little speech you just delivered, you&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll make grand old
Abe Lincoln look to his laurels.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">And so, with comradely teasing, threaded
with a more serious vein, an hour passed and the two
returned home with their baskets filled with the lovely
pink and white, delicately fragrant, trailing arbutus.</p>

<p align="left">They found the supper ready, Uncle
Amos washed and combed, and waiting on the back porch
for the summons to the meal.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist peeped into the basket
and exclaimed in joy as she breathed in the sweet
perfume of the fresh flowers. Millie paused in the
act of pouring coffee into big blue cups to &#8220;get
a sniff of the smell,&#8221; but Aunt Rebecca was
impatient at the momentary delay. &#8220;My goodness,
but you poke around. I like to get the supper out
before it gets cold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">There was no perceptible hurry at
her words, but a few minutes later all were seated
about the big table in the kitchen with a hearty supper
spread before them.</p>

<p align="left">Uncle Amos was of a jovial, teasing
disposition, prone to occasional shrewd thrusts at
the idiosyncrasies of his acquaintances, but he held
sacred things sacred and rendered to reverent things
their due reverence. It was his acknowledged privilege
to say grace, at the meals served in the Reist home.</p>

<p align="left">That April evening, after he said,
&#8220;Amen,&#8221; Philip turned to Amanda and said,
&#8220;Polly wants some too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The girl burst into gay laughter.
Everybody at the table looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s funny?&#8221; asked Aunt Rebecca.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221;
Phil offered. &#8220;Last Saturday we were back at
Harnly&#8217;s. They have two parrots on the porch,
and all morning we tried to get those birds to talk.
They just sat and blinked at us, looked wise, but
said not a word. I forgot all about them when we went
in to dinner, but we had just sat down and bowed our
heads for grace when those birds began to talk. They
went at it as though some person had wound them up.
&#8216;Polly wants some dinner; Polly wants some, too.
Give Polly some too.&#8217; Well, it struck me funny.
Their voices were so shrill and it was such a surprise
after they refused to say a word, that I got to laughing.
I gave Amanda a nudge, and she got the giggles.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It was awful,&#8221; said Amanda.
&#8220;If Phil hadn&#8217;t nudged me I could have
weathered through by biting my lips.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything
to laugh about when two parrots talk,&#8221; was Aunt
Rebecca&#8217;s remark. &#8220;Anyhow, that was no
time to laugh. I guess you&#8217;ll remember what
I tell you, some day when you got to cry for all this
laughin&#8217; you do now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; said the mother,
&#8220;let &#8217;em laugh. I guess we were that way
too once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Bully for you, Mother,&#8221;
cried the boy; &#8220;you&#8217;re as young as any
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; chimed in Millie.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, say, Millie,&#8221; asked
Philip, &#8220;did you make that cherry pie I finished
up after school to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Was it good?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good? It melted in my mouth.
When I marry, Millie, I&#8217;m going to borrow you
for a while to come teach my wife how to make such
pies.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Listen at him now! Ain&#8217;t
it a wonder he wouldn&#8217;t think to get a wife
that knows how to cook and bake? But, Philip Reist,
you needn&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever leave your
mom unless she sends me off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you, now, Millie?&#8221; asked
Uncle Amos.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, be sure, not! I ain&#8217;t
forgettin&#8217; how nice she was to me a&#8217;ready.
I had hard enough to make through before I came here
to work. I had a place to live out in Readin&#8217;
where I was to get big money, but when I got there
I found I was to go in the back way always, even on
Sunday, and was to eat alone in the kitchen after
they eat, and I was to go to my room and not set with
the folks at all. I just wouldn&#8217;t live like
that, so I come back to Lancaster County and heard
about you people wantin&#8217; a girl, and here I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda looked at the hired girl. In
her calico dress and gingham apron, her hair combed
back plain from her homely face, she was certainly
not beautiful, and yet the girl who looked at her
thought she appeared really attractive as the gratitude
of her loyal heart shone on her countenance.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Millie&#8217;s a jewel,&#8221;
thought Amanda. &#8220;And Mother&#8217;s another.
I hope I shall be like them as I grow older.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After the supper dishes were washed,
Aunt Rebecca decided it was time for her to go home.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to
go in the automobile this time?&#8221; suggested Philip.
&#8220;It would go so much faster and is easier riding
than the carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Faster! Well, I guess that
horse of yourn can get me anywhere I want to go fast
enough to suit me. I got no time for all these new-fangled
things, like wagons that run without horses, and lights
you put on and off with a button. It goes good if
you don&#8217;t get killed yet with that automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll hitch up Bill,&#8221;
said the boy as he went out, an amused smile on his
face.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda was thoughtful as she bunched
the arbutus for the market next day. &#8220;I wonder
how Uncle Jonas could live with Aunt Rebecca,&#8221;
she questioned. Ah, that was an enlightening test.
&#8220;Am I an easy, pleasant person to live with?&#8221;
Making full allowance for differences in temperament
and dispositions, there was still, the girl thought,
a possible compatibility that could be cultivated
so that family life might be harmonious and happy.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s that I am going
to consider when I get married, if I ever do,&#8221;
she decided that day. &#8220;I won&#8217;t marry a
man who would &#8216;jaw&#8217; like Aunt Rebecca.
I&#8217;m fiery-tempered myself, and I&#8217;ll have
to learn to control my anger better. Goodness knows
I&#8217;ve had enough striking examples of how scolding
sounds! But I won&#8217;t want to squabble with the
man I really care for--Martin Landis, for instance--&#8221;
Her thoughts went off to her castles in Spain as she
gathered the arbutus into little bunches and tied
them. &#8220;He offered to help me fix my schoolroom
for the Spelling Bee on Saturday. He&#8217;s got a
big heart, my Sir Galahad of childhood.&#8221; She
smiled as she thought of her burned hand and his innocent
kiss. &#8220;Poor Martin--he&#8217;s working like
a man these ten years. I&#8217;d like to see him have
a chance at education like Lyman Mertzheimer has. I
know he&#8217;d accomplish something in the world
then! At any rate, Martin&#8217;s a gentleman and
Lyman&#8217;s a--ugh, I hate the very thought of him.
I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s not at home to come to my
Spelling Bee.&#8221;</p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER VIII</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Spelling Bee</h2>

<p align="left">The old-fashioned Spelling Bee has
never wholly died out in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
Each year readers of certain small-town papers will
find numerous news-titles headed something like this:
&#8220;The Bees Will Buzz,&#8221; and under them an
urgent invitation to attend a Spelling Bee at a certain
rural schoolhouse. &#8220;A Good Time Promised"--"Classes
for All"--"Come One, Come All"--the advertisements
never fail. Many persons walk or ride to the little
schoolhouse. The narrow seats, the benches along the
wall, and all extra chairs that can be brought to the
place are taken long before the hour set for the bees
to buzz. The munificent charge is generally fifteen
cents, and where in this whole United States of America
can so much real enjoyment be secured for fifteen
cents as is given at an old-fashioned Spelling Bee?</p>

<p align="left">That April evening of Amanda&#8217;s
Bee the Crow Hill schoolhouse was filled at an early
hour. The scholars, splendid in their Sunday clothes,
occupied front seats. Parents, friends and interested
visitors from near-by towns crowded into the room.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda, dressed in white, came upon
the platform and announced that the scholars had prepared
a simple program which would be interspersed through
the spelling classes.</p>

<p align="left">Vehement clapping of hands greeted
her words and then the audience became silent as the
littlest scholar of the school rose and delivered
the address of welcome. There followed music and more
recitations, all amateurish, but they brought feelings
of pride to many mothers and fathers who listened,
smiling, to &#8220;Our John&#8221; or &#8220;Our Mary&#8221;
do his or her best.</p>

<p align="left">But the real excitement began with
the spelling classes. The first was open to all children
under fourteen. At the invitation, boys and girls
walked bravely to the front and joined the line till
it reached from one side of the room to the opposite.
A teacher from a neighboring town gave out the words.
The weeding-out process soon began. Some fell down
on simple words, others handled difficult ones with
ease and spelled glibly through some which many of
the older people present had forgotten existed. Soon
the class narrowed down to two. Back and forth, back
and forth the words rolled until the teacher pronounced
one of the old standby catch-words. One of the contestants
shook his head, puzzled, and surrendered.</p>

<p align="left">There was more music, several recitations
by the children, a spelling class for older people,
more music, then a General Information class, whose
participants were asked such questions as, &#8220;Who
is State Superintendent of Schools?&#8221; &#8220;How
many legs has a fly?&#8221; &#8220;How many teeth
has a cow?&#8221; &#8220;Which color is at the top
of the rainbow arch?&#8221; The amazed, puzzled expressions
on the faces of the questioned afforded much merriment
for the others. It was frequently necessary to wait
a moment until the laughter was suppressed before
other questions could be asked.</p>

<p align="left">A geographical class was equally interesting.
&#8220;How many counties has Pennsylvania?&#8221;
sent five persons to their seats before it was answered
correctly. Others succeeded in locating such queer
names as Popocatepetl, Martinique, Ashtabula, Rhodesia,
Orkney, Comanche.</p>

<p align="left">A little later the last spelling class
was held. It was open to everybody. The line was already
stretched across the schoolroom when Lyman Mertzheimer,
home for a few days of vacation, entered the schoolhouse.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; thought Amanda,
&#8220;what does he want here? I&#8217;d rather do
without his fifteen cents! He expects to make a show
and win the prize from every one else.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Lyman, indeed, swaggered down the
room and entered the line, bearing the old air of
superiority. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show them how to spell,&#8221;
he thought as he took his place. Spelling had been
his strong forte in the old days of school, and it
was soon evident that he retained his former ability.
The letters of the most confusing words fell from his
lips as though the very pages of the spelling-book
were engraved upon his brain. He held his place until
the contest had ruled out all but two beside himself.
Then he looked smilingly at Amanda and reared his head
in new dignity and determination.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Stelliform, the shape of a
star,&#8221; submitted the teacher. The word fell
to Lyman. He was visibly hesitant. Was it stelli or
stella?</p>

<p align="left">Bringing his knowledge of Latin into
service, he was inclined to think it was stella. He
began, &#8220;S-t-e-l-l--&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He looked uncertainly at one of his
friends who was seated in the front seat. He, also,
was a champion speller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if Joe would only help me!&#8221; thought
the speller.</p>

<p align="left">As if telepathy were possible, Joe
raised the forefinger of his left hand to his eye,
looked at Lyman with a meaning glance that told him
what he craved to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Iform,&#8221; finished Lyman in sure tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That was clever of Joe,&#8221;
thought the cheat as the teacher gave out a word to
one of the three contestants. &#8220;I just caught
his sign in time. Nobody noticed it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But he reckoned without the observant
teacher of Crow Hill school. Amanda, seated in the
front of the room and placed so she half faced the
audience and with one little turn of her head could
view the spellers, had seen the cheating process and
understood its significance. The same trick had been
attempted by some of her pupils several times during
the monthly spelling tests she held for the training
of her classes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;The cheat! The big cheat!&#8221;
she thought, her face flushing with anger. &#8220;How
I hope he falls down on the next word he gets!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">However, the punishment he deserved
was not meted out to him. Lyman Mertzheimer outspelled
his opponents and stood alone on the platform, a smiling
victor.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;The cheat! The contemptible
cheat!&#8221; hammered in Amanda&#8217;s brain.</p>

<p align="left">After the distribution of prizes,
cheap reprint editions of well-known books, an auctioneer
stepped on the platform and drew from a corner a bushel
basket of packages of various sizes and shapes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oyez, Oyez,&#8221; he called
in true auctioneer style, &#8220;we have here a bushel
of good things, all to be sold, sight unseen, to the
highest bidder. I understand each package contains
something good to eat, packed and contributed by the
pupils of this school. The proceeds of the sale are
to be used to purchase good books for the school library
for the pupils to read. So, folks, bid lively and don&#8217;t
be afraid to run a little risk. You&#8217;ll get more
fun from the package you buy than you&#8217;ve had
for a long time, I&#8217;ll warrant.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">With much talk and gesticulation the
spirited bidding was kept up until every package was
sold. Shouts of joy came from the. country boys when
one opened a box filled with ten candy suckers and
distributed them among the crowd. Other bidders won
candy, cake, sandwiches, and loud was the laughter
when a shoe-box was sold for a dollar, opened and
found to contain a dozen raw sweet potatoes.</p>

<p align="left">After the fun of the auction had died
down all rose and sang &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#8221;
and the Spelling Bee was over.</p>

<p align="left">The audience soon began to leave.
Laughing girls and boys started down the dark country
roads. Carriages and automobiles carried many away
until a mere handful of people were left in the little
schoolhouse.</p>

<p align="left">Lyman Mertzheimer lingered. He approached
Amanda, exchanged greetings with her and asked, &#8220;May
I walk home with you? I have something to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I suppose so,&#8221; she
replied, not very graciously. The dishonest method
of gaining a prize still rankled in her. Lyman walked
about the room impatiently, looking idly at the drawings
and other work of the children displayed above the
blackboards.</p>

<p align="left">A moment later Martin Landis came
up to Amanda. He had been setting chairs in their
places, gathering singing-books and putting the room
in order.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, Manda,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;it was a grand success! Everything went off
fine, lots of fun for all. And I heard Hershey, the
director, tell his wife that you certainly know how
to conduct a Spelling Bee.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, did he say that?&#8221;
The news pleased her. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s
over.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I guess you are. There, we&#8217;re
all fixed up now. I&#8217;ll send one of the boys
over next week with the team to take back the borrowed
chairs. I&#8217;ll walk home with you, Manda. What&#8217;s
Lyman Mertzheimer hanging around for? Soon as those
people by the door leave, we can lock up and go.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why--Martin--thank you--but
Lyman asked to walk home with me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh! All right,&#8221; came
the calm reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again. Good-night,
Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She looked after him as he walked
away, the plumed knight of her castles in Spain. She
had knighted him that day long ago when he had put
out the fire and kissed her hand, and during the interval
of years that childish affection had grown in her
heart. In her thoughts he was still &#8220;My Martin.&#8221;
But the object of that long-abiding affection showed
all too plainly that he was not cognizant of what was
in the heart of his childhood&#8217;s friend. To him
she was still &#8220;Just Amanda,&#8221; good comrade,
sincere friend.</p>

<p align="left">Fortunately love and hope are inseparable.
Amanda thought frequently of the verse, &#8220;God
above is great to grant as mighty to make, and creates
the love to reward the love.&#8221; It was not always
so, she knew, but she hoped it would be so for her.
Martin Landis, unselfish, devoted to his people, honest
as a dollar, true as steel--dear Martin, how she wanted
to walk home with him that night of the Spelling Bee
instead of going with Lyman Mertzheimer!</p>

<p align="left">The voice of the latter roused her
from her revery. &#8220;I say, Amanda, are we going
to stay here all night? Why in thunder can&#8217;t
those fools go home so you can lock the door and go!
And I say, Amanda, don&#8217;t you think Martin Landis
is letting himself grow shabby and seedy? He&#8217;s
certainly settling into a regular clodhopper. He shuffled
along like a hecker to-night. I don&#8217;t believe
he ever has his clothes pressed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin&#8217;s tired to-night,&#8221;
she defended, her eyes flashing fire. &#8220;He worked
in the fields all day, helping his father. Then he
and one of his brothers took their team and went after
some chairs I wanted to borrow for the Spelling Bee.
They arranged the room for me, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I see. Poor fellow! It
must be the very devil to be poor!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The words angered the girl. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
she flared out, &#8220;if you want to talk about Martin
Landis, you go home. I&#8217;ll get home without you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, Amanda,&#8221; he pleaded
sweetly, &#8220;don&#8217;t get huffy, please! I want
you in a good humor. I have something great to tell
you. Can&#8217;t you take a bit of joshing? Of course,
it&#8217;s fine in you to defend your old friends.
But I didn&#8217;t really mean to say anything mean
about Martin. You do get hot so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It must be my red-hair-temper,&#8221;
she said, laughing. &#8220;I do fly off the handle,
as Phil says, far too soon.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Shall we go now?&#8221; Lyman
asked as the last lingering visitors left the room.</p>

<p align="left">The lights were put out, the schoolhouse
door locked, and Amanda and Lyman started off on the
dark country road. Peals of merry laughter floated
back to them occasionally from a gay crowd of young
people who were also going home from the Spelling
Bee. But there were none near enough to hear what
most wonderful thing Lyman had to say to Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda,&#8221; he lost no time
in broaching the subject, &#8220;I said I have something
to tell you. I meant, to ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Before the astonished girl could answer,
he put his arms about her and drew her near, as though
there could be no possibility of an unfavorable reply.</p>

<p align="left">She flung away from him, indignant.
&#8220;Lyman,&#8221; she said, with hot anger in her
voice, &#8220;you better wait once till I say yes before
you try that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, Amanda! Now, sweetheart,
none of that temper! You can&#8217;t get cross when
I ask you anything like that! I want to marry you.
I&#8217;ve always wanted it. I picked you for my sweetheart
when we were both children. I&#8217;ve always thought
you&#8217;re the dandiest girl I could find. Ever since
we were kids I&#8217;ve planned of the time when we
were old enough to marry. I just thought to-night,
when I saw several fellows looking at you as though
they&#8217;d like to have you, I better get busy and
ask you before some other chap turns your head. I&#8217;ll
be good to you and treat you right, Amanda. Of course,
I&#8217;m in college yet, but I&#8217;ll soon be through,
and then I expect to get a good position, probably
in some big city. We&#8217;ll get out of this slow
country section and live where there&#8217;s some
life and excitement. You know I&#8217;ll be rich some
day, and then you&#8217;ll have everything you want.
Come on, honey, tell me, are we engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I should say not!&#8221;
the girl returned with cruel frankness. &#8220;You
talk as though I were a piece of furniture you could
just walk into a store and select and buy and then
own! You&#8217;ve been taking immeasurably much for
granted if you have been thinking all those things
you just spoke about.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But what don&#8217;t you like
about me?&#8221; The young man was unable to grasp
the fact that his loyal love could be unrequited. &#8220;I&#8217;m
decent.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s very important,
but there&#8217;s more than that necessary when two
persons think of marrying. You asked me,--I&#8217;ll
tell you--I never cared for you. I don&#8217;t like
your principles, your way of sneering at poor people,
your laxity in many things--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;For instance: the way you spelled
stelliform to-night and won a prize for it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; He laughed
as though discovered in a huge joke. &#8220;Did you
see that? Why, that was nothing. It was only a cheap
book I got for the prize. I&#8217;ll give the book
back to you if that will square me in your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see, can&#8217;t
you see, it wasn&#8217;t the cheap book that mattered?
It&#8217;s the thought that you&#8217;d be dishonest,
a cheat.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; he snatched at
the least straw, &#8220;here&#8217;s your chance to
reform me. If you marry me I&#8217;ll be a different
person. I&#8217;d do anything for you. You know love
is a great miracle worker. Won&#8217;t you give me
a chance to show you how nearly I can live up to your
standards and ideals?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda, moved by woman&#8217;s quick
compassion, spurred by sympathy, and feeling the exaltation
such an appeal always carries, felt her heart soften
toward the man beside her. But her innate wisdom and
her own strong hold on her emotions prevented her
from doing any rash or foolish thing. Her voice was
gentle as she answered, but there was a finality in
it that the man should have noted.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Lyman, but
I can&#8217;t do as you say. We can&#8217;t will whom
we will love. I know you and I would never be happy
together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But perhaps it will come to
you.&#8221; He was no easy loser. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
just keep on hoping that some day you&#8217;ll care
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;m
positive, sure, that I&#8217;ll never love you. You
and I were never made for each other.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But he refused to accept her answer
as final. &#8220;Who knows, Amanda,&#8221; he said
lightly, yet with all the feeling he was capable of
at that time, &#8220;perhaps you&#8217;ll love and
marry Lyman Mertzheimer yet! Stranger things than
that have happened. I&#8217;m sorry about that word.
It seemed just like a good joke to catch on to the
right spelling that way and beat the others in the
match. You are too strict, Amanda, too closely bound
by the Lancaster County ideas of right and wrong.
They are too narrow for these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she said quickly. &#8220;Dishonesty
is never right!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;have
it your way! See how docile I have become already!
You&#8217;ll reform me yet, I bet!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">At the door of her home he bade her
good-night and went off whistling, feeling only a
slight unhappiness at her refusal to marry him. It
was, he felt, but a temporary rebuff. She would capitulate
some day. His consummate egotism buoyed his spirits
and he went down the road dreaming of the day he&#8217;d
marry Amanda Reist and of the wonderful gowns and
jewels he would lavish upon her.</p>

<a name="ch9"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER IX</h1>

<h2 align="center">At the Market</h2>

<p align="left">The words of Lyman Mertzheimer lingered
with Amanda for many days. He had seemed so confident,
so arrogantly sure, of her ultimate surrender to his
desire to marry her. Soon after the Spelling Bee he
returned to his college and the girl sighed in relief
that his presence was not annoying her. But she reckoned
without the efficient United States mail service.
The rejected lover wrote lengthy, friendly letters
which she answered at long intervals by short, impersonal
little notes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, yea,&#8221; she said to
herself one day, &#8220;why does it have to be Lyman
Mertzheimer that falls in love with me? But he might
as well fall out as soon as he can. I&#8217;ll never
marry him. I read somewhere that one girl said, &#8217;I&#8217;d
rather love what I cannot have, than have what I cannot
love,&#8217; and that&#8217;s just the way I feel about
it. I won&#8217;t marry Lyman Mertzheimer if I have
to die Amanda Reist!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As soon as her school term was ended
Amanda entered into the work of the farm. She helped
Millie as much as possible in a determined effort
to forget all about the man who wanted her and whom
she did not want, and, more than that, to think less
about her knight, her Sir Galahad, who evidently had
no time to waste on girls.</p>

<p align="left">Millie appreciated Amanda&#8217;s
help. &#8220;There&#8217;s one thing sure,&#8221; she
said proudly to Mrs. Reist, &#8220;our Amanda ain&#8217;t
lazy. It seems to abody she&#8217;s workin&#8217;
more&#8217;n ever this here spring. I guess mebbe she
thinks she better get all the ins and outs o&#8217;
housework so as she can do it right till she gets
married once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I guess Amanda ain&#8217;t
thinkin&#8217; of marryin&#8217; yet,&#8221; said the
mother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You fool yourself,&#8221; was
Millie&#8217;s wise answer. &#8220;Is there ever a
woman born that don&#8217;t think &#8217;bout it?
Women ain&#8217;t made that way. There ain&#8217;t
one so ugly nor poor, nor dumb, that don&#8217;t hanker
about it sometimes, even if she knows it ain&#8217;t
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the entrance of Amanda cut short the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Millie,&#8221; asked the girl, &#8220;shall
I go to market with you this week?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, yes. I&#8217;d be glad
for you. Of course, you always help get things ready
here and your Uncle Amos drives me in and helps to
get the baskets emptied and the things on the counters,
but I could use you in sellin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll come. This
lovely spring weather makes me want to go. I like
to see the people come in to buy flowers and early
vegetables. It&#8217;s like reading a page out of
a romance to see the expressions on the faces of the
city people as they buy the products of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I don&#8217;t know what
you mean. I guess you got too much fine learnin&#8217;
for me. But all I can see in market is people runnin&#8217;
up one aisle and down the other to see where the onions
or radishes is the cheapest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s
part of the romance. It proves they are human.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The following Saturday Amanda accompanied
Millie to the Lancaster market to help dispose of
the assortment of farm products the Reist stall always
carried.</p>

<p align="left">Going to market in Lancaster is an
interesting experience. In addition to the famous
street markets, where farmers display their produce
along the busy central streets of the city, there
are indoor markets where crowds move up and down and
buy butter, eggs and vegetables, and such Pennsylvania
Dutch specialties as mince meat, cup cheese, sauerkraut,
pannhaus, apple butter, fresh sausage and smear cheese.
While lovers of flowers choose from the many old-fashioned
varieties--straw flowers, zinnias, dahlias.</p>

<p align="left">The Reist stall was one of the prominent
stalls of the market. Twice every week Millie &#8220;tended
market&#8221; there. On the day before market several
members of the Reist household were kept busy preparing
all the produce, and the next day before dawn Uncle
Amos hitched the horse to the big covered wagon and
he and Millie, sometimes Amanda and Philip, drove
over the dark country roads to the city.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda enjoyed the work. She arranged
the glistening domes of cup cheese, placed the fresh
eggs in small baskets, uncovered one of the bags of
dried corn untied the cloth cover from a gray earthen
crock of apple butter, and then stood and looked about
the market house. She felt the human interest it never
failed to waken in her. Behind many stalls stood women
in the quaint garb of the Church of the Brethren or
Mennonite. But quaintest of all were the Amish.</p>

<p align="left">The Amish are the plainest and quaintest
of the plain sects that flourish in Lancaster County.
Unlike their kindred sects, who wear plain garb, they
are partial to gay colors in dress. So it is no unusual
sight to see Amish women wearing dresses of such colors
as forest green, royal purple, king&#8217;s blue or
garnet. But the gay dress is always plainly made,
after the model of their sect, generally partially
subdued by a great black apron, a black pointed cape
over the shoulders and a big black bonnet which almost
hides the face of its wearer and necessitates a full-face
gaze to disclose the identity of the woman. The strings
of the thick white lawn cap are invariably tied in
a flat bow that lies low on the chest.</p>

<p align="left">The Amish men are equally interesting
in appearance. They wear broad-brimmed hats with
low crowns. Their clothes are so extremely plain that
buttons, universally deemed indispensable, are taboo
and their place is filled by the inconspicuous hook-and-eye,
which style has brought upon them the sobriquet, &#8220;Hook-and-eye
people.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">However, interesting as the men and
women of the Amish faith are in their dress, they
are eclipsed in that aspect by the Amish children.
These are invariably dressed as exact replicas of their
parents. Little boys, mere children of three and four
years, wear long trousers, tight jackets, blocked
hair and broad-brimmed, low-crowned hats. Little girls
of tender years wear brightly colored woolen dresses,
one-piece aprons of black sateen or colored chambray,
and the picturesque big stiff bonnets of the faith.</p>

<p align="left">A stranger in Lancaster County seeing
an Amish family group might easily wonder if he had
not been magically transported to some secluded spot
of Europe, far from the beaten paths of modernity.
But in the cosmopolitan population of Lancaster the
Amish awakes a mere moment&#8217;s interest to the
majority of observers. If a bit of envy steals into
the heart of the little Amish girl who stands at the
Square and sees a child in white organdie and pink
sash tripping along with her feet in silk socks and
white slippers, of what avail is it? The hold of family
customs is strong among them and the world and its
allurements and vanities are things to be left stringently
alone.</p>

<p align="left">To Amanda Reist, the Amish children
made strong appeal. Their presence was one of the
reasons she enjoyed tending market. Many stories she
wove in her imagination about the little lads in their
long trousers and the tiny girls in their big bonnets.</p>

<p align="left">But when the marketing was in full
swing Amanda had scant time for any weaving of imaginary
stories. Purchasers stopped at the stall and in a
short time the produce was sold, with the exception
of cheese and eggs which had been ordered the previous
week.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; complained Millie,
&#8220;now if these people would fetch this cheese
and the eggs we&#8217;d be done and could go home.
Our baskets are all empty but them. But it seems like
some of these here city folks can&#8217;t get to market
till eight o&#8217;clock. They have to sleep till seven.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She was interrupted by the approach
of a young girl, fashionably dressed.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Amanda,
&#8220;here comes Isabel Souders, one of the Millersville
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Isabel Souders was a girl of the butterfly
type, made for sunshine, beauty, but not intended,
apparently, for much practical use. Like the butterfly,
her excuse for being was her beauty. Pretty, with dark
hair, Amanda sometimes had envied her during days
at the Normal School. Well dressed, petted and spoiled
by well-to-do parents who catered to her whims, she
seemed, nevertheless, an attractive girl in manner
as well as in appearance. At school something like
friendship had sprung up between Amanda and the city
girl, no doubt each attracted to the other by the
very directness of their opposite personalities and
tastes.</p>

<p align="left">Isabel Souders was a year younger
than Amanda. She lacked all of the latter&#8217;s
ambition. Music and Art and having a good time were
the things that engrossed her attention. At Millersville
she had devoted her time to the pursuit of the three.
Professors and hall teachers knew that the moving
spirit of many harmless pranks was Isabel, but she
had a way of glossing things, shedding blame without
causing innocent ones to suffer, that somehow endeared
her to students and teachers alike.</p>

<p align="left">That market day she came laughing
down the market aisle to greet Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello, Amanda! What do you
think of me, here at this early hour of the day? Pin
a medal on me! But it was so glorious a day I felt
like doing something out of the ordinary. I promised
one of the Lancaster girls who is at school now that
I&#8217;d ask you about the pink moccasins. Are they
out yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just out. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This girl wants one for her
collection. I remembered you had a perfect one in
your lot of flowers at school and I said I&#8217;d
see you about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be at their best next Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Next Saturday--dear, Helen&#8217;s
going home over the week-end. Oh, could I come out
and get one for her?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll be glad to
take you where they grow. I have a special haunt.
If no botanizers or flower hunters find my spot, we&#8217;ll
get a beauty for your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You&#8217;re the same old darling,
Amanda,&#8221; said the girl sweetly. &#8220;Then
I&#8217;ll be out to your house Saturday afternoon.
How do I get there?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Take the car to Oyster Point,
then walk till you find a mail-box with our name on
it, and there I&#8217;ll be found.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Thank you, Amanda, you are
a dear! I&#8217;ll be there for the pink moccasin.
Won&#8217;t it be romantic to hunt for such lovely
things as they are? You&#8217;re perfectly sweet to
bother about it and offer to take me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind doing
that. I&#8217;ll enjoy it. Finding the wild pink lady-slipper
is a real joy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Unselfish Amanda, she could not dream
of what would come out of that little hunt for the
pink moccasin!</p>

<a name="ch10"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER X</h1>

<h2 align="center">Pink Moccasins</h2>

<p align="left">The pink moccasin, the largest of
our native orchids, is easily the queen of the rare
woodland spot in which it grows. Its flower of bright
rose pink, veined with red, is held with the stalwart
erectness of an Indian, whose love of solitude and
quiet woods it shares.</p>

<p align="left">To Amanda it was one of the loveliest
flowers of the woods. She always counted the days
as the time drew near when the moccasins bloomed.</p>

<p align="left">When Isabel Souders arrived at the
Reist farmhouse she found Amanda ready with basket
and trowel for the lady-slipper hunt. Amanda had put
on a simple white dress and green-and-white sun hat.
She looked with bewilderment at the city girl&#8217;s
attire, but said nothing just then. They stopped long
enough for Isabel to meet the mistress of the home
and then they went down the road to the Crow Hill schoolhouse.</p>

<p align="left">Suddenly Isabel stood still and panted.
&#8220;Oh--Manda--you <i>can</i> run! Have compassion
on me. My hair will be all tumbled after such mad
walking, and my organdie torn.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hair!&#8221; echoed the country
girl with a laugh. &#8220;Who thinks about hair on
a moccasin hunt? You should not go flower hunting in
city clothes. With your pink and white dress and lovely
Dresden sash, silk stockings and low shoes, you look
more fit for a dance than a ramble after deep woods
flowers, such as moccasins. But we might as well go
on now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She led the way across the school-yard,
climbed nimbly over the rail fence and laughed at
Isabel&#8217;s clumsy imitation of her. Pink azaleas
grew in great bushes of bloom throughout the woods.
Isabel would have stopped to pick some but Amanda
said, &#8220;That withers easily. Better pick them
when we come back.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">They followed a narrow path, so narrow
that later the summer luxuriant growth of underbrush
would almost obliterate it. But Amanda knew the way
to her spot. Deeper into the woods they delved, past
bowers of pink azalea and closely growing branches
of trees whose tender green foliage was breaking into
summer growth. The bright May sunshine dripped through
the green and dappled the ground in little discs of
gold.</p>

<p align="left">Suddenly the path led up-hill in a
steep grade. Amanda stopped and leaned against a slender
sapling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand here and look up,&#8221; she invited.</p>

<p>Isabel obeyed, her gaze traveling searchingly along
the steep trail.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, the beauties!&#8221; she
cried as she discovered the pink flowers. &#8220;The
beauties! Oh, there are more of them! And still more!
Oh, Amanda!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Before them was Amanda&#8217;s haunt
of the pink moccasin. From the low underbrush of spring
growth rose several dozen gorgeously beautiful pink
lady-slippers, each alone on a thick stem with two
broad leaves spreading their green beauty near the
base. What miracle had brought the rare shy plants
so near the dusty road where rattling wagons and gliding
automobiles sped on their busy way?</p>

<p>&#8220;May I pick them?&#8221; asked the city girl.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, but only one root. I&#8217;ll
dig that up with the trowel. That&#8217;s for your
friend&#8217;s botany specimen. The rest we&#8217;ll
pull up gently and we&#8217;ll get flower, stem and
leaves and leave the roots in the ground for other
years. I never pick all of the flowers. I leave some
here in the woods --it seems they belong here and
I can&#8217;t bring myself to walk off with every
last one of them in my arms and leave the hill desolate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You <i>are</i> a queer girl!&#8221;
was the frank statement of the city girl. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re a dear, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>They picked a number of the largest flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; Amanda declared.</p>

<p>Isabel laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;d take every one if
it were my haunt.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And then other people might
come here after some and find the place robbed of
all its blooms.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the other girl
easily, &#8220;I look out for Isabel. Now, please,
may I pick some of that pretty wild azalea?&#8221;
she asked teasingly as they came down the hill.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Help yourself. That isn&#8217;t
rare. You couldn&#8217;t take all of that if you tried.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">So Isabel gathered branches of the
pink bloom until her arms were filled with it and
the six moccasins in her hand almost overshadowed.</p>

<p align="left">As the two girls reached the edge
of the woods and climbed over the fence into the school-yard
Martin Landis came walking down the road.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he called gaily.
&#8220;Been robbing the woods, Amanda?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they lovely?&#8221;
she asked. Then when he drew near she introduced him
to the girl beside her.</p>

<p align="left">Martin Landis was not a blind man.
A pretty girl, dark-eyed and dusky-haired, her arms
full of pink azaleas, her lips parted in a smile above
the flowers, and that smile given to him--it was too
pretty a picture to fail in making an impression upon
him.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda saw the look of keen interest
in the eyes of the girl and her heart felt heavy.
What fortune had brought the two together? Had the
Fates designed the meeting of Isabel and Martin? &#8220;Oh,
now I&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; thought Amanda. &#8220;Isabel
wants what she wants and generally gets it. Pray heaven,
she won&#8217;t want &#8216;My Martin!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Similar thoughts disturbed her as
they stepped on the sunny road once more and stood
there talking. With a gay laugh Isabel took the finest
pink moccasin from her bunch and handed it to Martin.
&#8220;Here, I&#8217;ll be generous,&#8221; she said
in friendly tones.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Thank you, Miss Souders.&#8221;
The reply was accompanied with a smile of pleasure.</p>

<p align="left">A low laugh rippled from the girl&#8217;s
red lips. Amanda&#8217;s ears tingled so she did not
understand the exchange of light talk. The fear and
jealousy in her heart dulled her senses to all save
them, but she laughed, said good-bye, and hid her
feelings as she and Isabel went down the road to the
Reist farmhouse.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda,&#8221; the other girl
said effusively, &#8220;what a fine young man! Is he
your beau?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No. Certainly not! I have no
beau. I&#8217;ve known Martin Landis ever since I
was born, almost. He lives down the road a piece. He&#8217;s
a nice chap.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Splendid! Fine! Such eyes,
such wonderfully expressive gray eyes I have never
seen. And he has such a strong face. Of course, his
clothes are a bit shabby. He&#8217;d be great if he
fixed up.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Amanda agreed mechanically.
She was ill-pleased with the dissection of her knight.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist, with true rural, Pennsylvania
Dutch hospitality, invited Isabel to have supper with
them, an invitation readily accepted. At the close
of the meal Isabel said suddenly to Mrs. Reist, &#8220;How
would you like to have me board with you for a few
weeks--a month, probably?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know. All
right, I guess, if Millie, here, don&#8217;t think
it makes too much work. Poor Millie&#8217;s got the
worst of all the work to do. I ain&#8217;t so strong,
and there&#8217;s much always to do. Of course, Amanda
helps, but none of us do as much as Millie.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But me, don&#8217;t I get paid
for it, and paid good?&#8221; asked the hired girl,
sending a loving glance at Mrs. Reist. &#8220;Far as
I go it&#8217;s all right to have Isabel come for
a while. Mebbe she can help, too, sometimes with the
work.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be much help,
I&#8217;m afraid. I never peeled a potato in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Millie looked at the girl with slightly
concealed disfavor. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s a funny
way, now, to bring up a girl! I guess it&#8217;s time
you learn such things once! You dare come, and I&#8217;ll
show you how to do a little work. But why do you want
to board when your folks live just in Lancaster?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Father and Mother are going
to the Elks&#8217; Convention and to California. They
expect to be gone about a month. I was going to stay
in Lancaster with my aunt, but I just thought how
much nicer it would be to spend that time in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I guess, too!&#8221;
Millie was quick to understand how one would naturally
prefer the country to the city.</p>

<p align="left">So it was settled that Isabel Souders
was to spend June at the Reist farmhouse. Everybody
concerned appeared well pleased with the arrangement.
But Amanda&#8217;s heart hurt. &#8220;Why did I take
her for those moccasins?&#8221; she thought drearily
after Isabel had gone back to the city with her precious
flowers. &#8220;I know Martin will fall in love with
her and she with him. Oh, I&#8217;m a mean, detestable
thing! But I wish she&#8217;d go to the coast with
her parents!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch11"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XI</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Boarder</h2>

<p align="left">The big automobile that brought Isabel
Souders to the Reist farmhouse one day early in June
brought with her a trunk, a suitcase, a bag, an umbrella
and a green parasol.</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca was visiting there that
day and she followed Amanda to the front door to receive
the boarder.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; came the
exclamation as the luggage was carried in, &#8220;is
that girl comin&#8217; here for good, with all <i>that</i>
baggage? And what did you let her come here for on
a Friday? That&#8217;s powerful bad luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; thought Amanda as she went to
meet Isabel.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;See,&#8221; the newcomer pointed
to her trunk, &#8220;I brought some of my pretties
along. I&#8217;ll have to make hay while the sun shines.
I&#8217;ll have to make the most of this opportunity
to win the heart of some country youth. Amanda, dear,
wouldn&#8217;t I be a charming farmer&#8217;s wife?
Can you visualize me milking cows, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Amanda,
&#8220;I&#8217;d say that you were cut out for a different
role.&#8221; There was a deeper meaning in the country
girl&#8217;s words than the flighty city girl could
read.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; went
on the newcomer, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have one
wonderful time in the country. You are such a dear
to want me here and to take me into the family. I
want to do just all the exciting things one reads
about as belonging to life in the country. I am eager
to climb trees and chase chickens and be a regular
country girl for a month.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I hope you brought some
old clothes,&#8221; was the practical reply.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not old, but plain little dresses
for hard wear. I knew I&#8217;d need them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Later, as Amanda watched the city
girl unpack, she smiled ruefully at the plain little
dresses for hard wear. Her observant eye told her that
the little dresses of gingham and linen must have cost
more than her own &#8220;best dresses.&#8221; It was
a very lavish wardrobe Isabel had selected for her
month on the farm. Silk stockings and crepe de chine
underwear were matched in fineness by the crepe blouses,
silk dresses, airy organdies, a suit of exquisite
tailoring and three hats for as many different costumes.
The whole outfit would have been adequate and appropriate
for parades on the Atlantic City boardwalk or a saunter
down Peacock Alley of a great hotel, but it was entirely
too elaborate for a Lancaster County farmhouse.</p>

<p align="left">Millie, running in to offer her services
in unpacking, stood speechless at the display of clothes.
&#8220;Why,&#8221; she almost stammered, &#8220;what
in the world do you want with all them fancy things
here? Them&#8217;s party clothes, ain&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No.&#8221; Isabel shook her
head. &#8220;Some are to wear in the evening and the
plainer ones are afternoon dresses, and the linen and
gingham ones are for morning wear.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I be! What don&#8217;t
they study for society folks! A different dress for
every time of the day! What would you think if you
had to dress like I do, with my calico dress on all
day, only when I wear my lawn for cool or in winter
a woolen one for warm?&#8221;</p>

<p>Millie went off, puzzled at the ways of society.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Is she just a servant?&#8221;
asked Isabel when they heard her heavy tread down
the stairs.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She isn&#8217;t <i>just</i>
anything! She&#8217;s a jewel! Mother couldn&#8217;t
do without Millie. We&#8217;ve had her almost twenty
years. We can leave everything to her and know it
will be taken care of. Why, Millie&#8217;s as much
a part of the family as though she really belonged
to it. When Phil and I were little she was always
baking us cookies in the shape of men or birds, and
they always had big raisin eyes. Millie&#8217;s a treasure
and we all think of her as being one of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother says that&#8217;s just
the reason she won&#8217;t hire any Pennsylvania Dutch
girls; they always expect to be treated as one of the
family. We have colored servants. You can teach them
their place.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see. I suppose so,&#8221;
agreed Amanda, while she mentally appraised the girl
before her and thought, &#8220;Isabel Souders, a little
more democracy wouldn&#8217;t be amiss for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Although the boarder who came to the
Reist farmhouse was unlike any of the members of the
family, she soon won her way into their affections.
Her sweet tenderness, her apparent childlike innocence,
appealed to the simple, unsuspicious country folk.
Shaping her actions in accordance with the old Irish
saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s better to have the dogs of
the street for you than against you,&#8221; Isabel
made friends with Millie and went so far as to pare
potatoes for her at busy times. Philip and Uncle Amos
were non-committal beyond a mere, &#8220;Oh, I guess
she&#8217;s all right. Good company, and nice to have
around.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The first Sunday of the boarder&#8217;s
stay in the country she invited herself to accompany
the family to Mennonite church. Amanda appeared in
a simple white linen dress and a semi-tailored black
hat, but when Isabel tripped down the stairs the daughter
of the house was quite eclipsed. Isabel&#8217;s dark
hair was puffed out becomingly about cheeks that had
added pink applied to them. In an airy orchid organdie
dress and hat to match, white silk stockings and white
buckskin pumps, she looked ready for a garden party.
According to all the ways of human nature more than
one little Mennonite maid in that meeting-house must
have cast sidelong glances at the beautiful vision,
and older members of the plain sect must have thought
the old refrain, &#8220;Vanity, vanity, all is vanity!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Aunt Rebecca was at church that morning
and came to the Reist home for dinner. She sought
out Millie in the kitchen and gave her unsolicited,
frank opinion--"My goodness, I don&#8217;t think much
of that there Isabel from Lancaster! She&#8217;s too
much stuck up. Such a get-up for a Sunday and church
like she has on to-day! She looks like a regular peacock.
It&#8217;ll go good if she don&#8217;t spoil our Amanda
yet till she goes home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I guess not. She&#8217;s
a little fancier than I like to see girls, but then
she&#8217;s a nice girl and can&#8217;t do Amanda no
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She means herself too big,
that&#8217;s what! And them folks ain&#8217;t the right
kind for Amanda to know. It might spite you all yet
for takin&#8217; her in to board. Next thing she&#8217;ll
be playin&#8217; round with some of the country boys
here, and mebbe take one that Amanda would liked to
get. There&#8217;s no trustin&#8217; such gay dressers.
I found that out long a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; said Millie, &#8220;I
guess Amanda don&#8217;t like none of the boys round
here in Crow Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;How do you know? Guess Amanda
ain&#8217;t no different from the rest of us in petticoats.
You just wait once and see how long it goes till the
boys commence to hang round this fancy Isabel.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Millie hadn&#8217;t long to wait.
Through Mrs. Landis, who had been to Mennonite church
and noticed a stranger with the Reist family, Martin
Landis soon knew of the boarder. That same evening
he dressed in his best clothes. He had not forgotten
the dark eyes of Isabel smiling to him over the pink
azaleas.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;, Mart?&#8221;
asked his mother. &#8220;Over to Landisville to church?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No--just out for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Take me with,&#8221; coaxed
the littlest Landis, now five years old and the ninth
in line.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, go on!&#8221; spoke up
an older Landis boy, &#8220;what d&#8217;you think
Mart wants with you? He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to see
his girl. Na, ah!&#8221; he cried gleefully and clapped
his hands, &#8220;I guessed it! Look at him blushin&#8217;,
Mom!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin made a grab for the boy and
shook him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got too much romantic
nonsense in your head,&#8221; he told the teasing brother.
&#8220;Next thing you know you&#8217;ll be a poet!&#8221;
He released the squirming boy and rubbed a finger
round the top of his collar as he turned to his mother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m just going down to
Reists&#8217; a while. I met Miss Souders a few weeks
ago and thought it would be all right for me to call.
The country must seem quiet to her after living in
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s all right,
Martin,&#8221; agreed his mother. &#8220;Just you go
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But after he left, Mrs. Landis sat
a long while on the porch, thinking about her eldest
boy, her first-born. &#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to see that doll right as soon as she comes near,
and yet Amanda he don&#8217;t go to see when she&#8217;s
alone, not unless he wants her to go for a walk or
something like that. If only he&#8217;d take to Amanda!
She&#8217;s the nicest girl in Lancaster County, I
bet! But he looks right by her. This pretty girl, in
her fancy clothes and with her flippy ways--I know
she&#8217;s flippy, I watched her in church--she takes
his eye, and if she matches her dress she&#8217;ll
go to his head like hard cider. Ach, sometimes abody
feels like puttin&#8217; blinders on your boys till
you get &#8217;em past some women.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">A little later the troubled mother
walked back to the side porch, where her husband was
enjoying the June twilight while he kept an eye on
four of the younger members of the family as they
were quietly engaged in their Sabbath recreation of
piecing together picture puzzles.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin,&#8221; she said as
she sat beside the man, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217;
about our Mart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? What?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, I feel we ain&#8217;t
doin&#8217; just right by him. You know he don&#8217;t
like farmin&#8217; at all. He&#8217;s anxious to get
more schoolin&#8217; but he ain&#8217;t complainin&#8217;.
He wants to fit himself so he can get in some office
or bank in the city and yet here he works on the farm
helpin&#8217; us like he really liked to do that kind
of work. Now he&#8217;s of age, and since Walter and
Joe are big enough to help you good and we&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; on our feet a little since the nine
babies are out of the dirt, as they say still, why
don&#8217;t we give Martin a chance once?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, why not? I&#8217;m agreed,
Ma. He&#8217;s been workin&#8217; double, and when
I&#8217;m laid up with that old rheumatism he runs
things good as I could. We got the mortgage paid off
now. How&#8217;d it be if we let him have the tobacco
money? I was thinkin&#8217; of puttin&#8217; in the
electric lights and fixin&#8217; things up a little
with it, but if you&#8217;d rather give it to Mart--&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I would. Much rather! I used
oil lamps this long and I guess I can manage with
them a while yet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, but as soon as we
can we&#8217;ll get others. Mart&#8217;s young and
ought to have his chance, like you say. I don&#8217;t
know what for he&#8217;d rather sit over a lot o&#8217;
books in some hot little office or stand in a stuffy
bank and count other people&#8217;s money when he could
work on a farm and be out in the open air, but then
we ain&#8217;t all alike and I guess it&#8217;s a
good thing we ain&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll tell him he
dare have time for goin&#8217; to Lancaster to school
if he wants. Mebbe he&#8217;ll be a lawyer or president
some day, ain&#8217;t, Ma?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Martin, I don&#8217;t
think that would be so much. I&#8217;d rather have
my children just plain, common people like we are.
Mart&#8217;s gone up to Reists&#8217; this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? To see Amanda, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her or that boarder from Lancaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ruffly girl we saw this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, don&#8217;t you worry,
Ma. Our Mart won&#8217;t run after that kind of a
girl! Anyhow, not for long.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">At that moment the object of their
discussion was approaching the Reist farmhouse. The
entire household, Millie included, sat on the big front
porch as the caller came down the road.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Philip, and
began to sing softly. &#8220;Here comes a beau a-courting,
a-courting---&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil!&#8221; chided Millie and Amanda in one
breath.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Sis,&#8221;
said the irrepressible youth, &#8220;we&#8217;ll gradually
efface ourselves, one by one--we&#8217;re very thoughtful.
I&#8217;ll flip a penny to see whether Isabel stays
or you. Heads you win, tails she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The vehement protest from his sister
did not deter the boy from tossing the coin, which
promptly rolled off the porch and fell into a bed of
geraniums.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;See,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;even
the Fates are uncertain which one of you will win.
I suppose the battle&#8217;s to the strongest this
time. Oh, hello, Martin,&#8221; he said graciously
as the caller turned in at the gate, &#8220;Nice day,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What ails the boy?&#8221; asked
Martin, laughing as he raised his hat and joined the
group on the porch.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Amanda
after he had greeted Isabel and took his place on
a chair near her, &#8220;you&#8217;d do me an everlasting
favor if you&#8217;d turn that brother of mine up
on your knees and spank him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;d like to see!&#8221; spoke
up Millie.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You would, Millie? You&#8217;d
like to see me get that? After all the coal I&#8217;ve
carried out of the cellar for you, and the other ways
I&#8217;ve helped make your burden lighter--you&#8217;d
sit and see me humiliated! Ingratitude! Even Millie
turns against me. I&#8217;m going away from this crowd
where I&#8217;m not appreciated.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t affect
such an air of martyrdom,&#8221; his sister told him.
&#8220;I know you have a book half read; you want to
get back to that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Uncle Amos,
&#8220;these women, if they don&#8217;t beat all! They
ferret all the weak spots out a man. I say it ain&#8217;t
right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Later in the evening the older members
of the household left the porch and the trio of eternal
trouble--two girls and a man--were left alone. It
was then the city girl exerted her most alluring wiles
to be entertaining. The man had eyes and ears for
her only. As Mrs. Landis once said, he looked past
Amanda and did not see her. She sat in the shadow
and bit her lip as her plumed knight paid court before
the beauty and charm of another. The heart of the
simple country girl ached. But Isabel smiled, flattered
and charmed and did it so adeptly that instead of
being obnoxious to the country boy it thrilled and
held him like the voice of a Circe. They never noticed
Amanda&#8217;s silence. She could lean back in her
chair and dream. She remembered the story of Ulysses
and his wax-filled ears that saved him from the sirens;
the tale of Orpheus, who drowned their alluring voices
by playing on his instrument a music sweeter than
theirs--ah, that was her only hope! That somewhere,
deep in the heart of the man she loved was a music
surpassing in sweetness the music of the shallow girl&#8217;s
voice which now seemed to sway him to her will. &#8220;If
he is a man worth loving,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;he&#8217;ll
see through the surface glamour of a girl like that.&#8221;
It was scant consolation, for she knew that only too
frequently do noble men give their lives into the precarious
keeping of frivolous, butterfly women.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why so pensive?&#8221; the
voice of Isabel pierced her revery.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Me--oh, I haven&#8217;t had
a chance to get a word in edgewise.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I was telling Mr. Landis he
should go on with his studies. A correspondence course
would be splendid for him if he can&#8217;t get away
from the farm for regular college work.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to write about
that course right away,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad I had this talk with you, Miss Souders. I&#8217;ll
do as you suggest-- study nights for a time and then
try to get into a bank in Lancaster. It is so kind
of you to offer to see your father about a position.
I&#8217;d feel in my element if I ever held a position
in a real bank. I&#8217;ll be indebted to you for
life.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she disclaimed any
credit, &#8220;your own merits would cause you to
make good in the position. I am sure Father will be
glad to help you. He has helped several young men
to find places. All he asks in return is that they
make good. I know you&#8217;d do that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When Martin Landis said good-night
his earnest, &#8220;May I come again-- soon?&#8221;
was addressed to Isabel. She magnanimously put an arm
about Amanda before she replied, &#8220;Certainly.
We&#8217;ll be glad to have you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; thought Amanda,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hating her pretty soon and then
how will I ever endure having her around for a whole
month! I&#8217;m a mean, jealous cat! Let Martin Landis
choose whom he wants--I should worry!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She said good-night with a stoical
attempt at indifference, thereby laying the first
block of the hard, high barricade she meant to build
about her heart. She would be no child to cry for the
moon, the unattainable. If her heart bled what need
to make a public exhibition of it! From that hour
on the front porch she turned her back on her gay,
merry, laughing girlhood and began the journey in the
realm of womanhood, where smiles hide sorrows and
the true feelings of the heart are often masked.</p>

<p align="left">The determination to meet events with
dignity and poise came to her aid innumerable times
during the days that followed. When Martin came to
the Reist farmhouse with the news that his father was
going to give him money for a course in a Business
School in Lancaster it was to Isabel he told the tidings
and from her he received the loudest handclaps.</p>

<p align="left">The city girl, rosy and pretty in
her morning dresses, ensconced herself each day on
the big couch hammock of the front porch to wave to
Martin Landis as he passed on his way to the trolley
that took him to his studies in the city. Sometimes
she ran to the gate and tossed him a rose for his
buttonhole. Later in the day she was at her post again,
ready to ask pleasantly as he passed, &#8220;Well,
how did school go to-day?&#8221; Such seemingly spontaneous
interest spurred the young man to greater things ahead.</p>

<p align="left">Many evenings Martin sat on the Reist
porch and he and Isabel laughed and chatted and sometimes
half-absent-mindedly referred a question to Amanda.
Frequently that young lady felt herself to be a fifth
wheel and sought some diversion. Excuses were easy
to find; the most palpable one was accepted with calm
credulity by the infatuated young people.</p>

<p align="left">One day, when three weeks of the boarder&#8217;s
stay were gone, Lyman Mertzheimer came home from college,
bringing with him a green roadster, the gift of his
wealthy, indulgent father.</p>

<p align="left">He drew up to the Reist house and
tooted his horn until Amanda ran into the yard to
discover what the noise meant.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good-morning, Lady Fair!&#8221;
he called, laughing at her expression of surprise.
&#8220;I thought I could make you come! Bump of curiosity
is still working, I see. Wait, I&#8217;m coming in,&#8221;
he called after her as she turned indignantly and
moved toward the house.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Please!&#8221; He called again
as she halted, ashamed to be so lacking in cordiality.
&#8220;I want to see you. That&#8217;s a cold, cruel
way to greet a fellow who&#8217;s just come home from
college and rushes over to see you first thing.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He entered the yard and Amanda bade
him, &#8220;Come up. Sit down,&#8221; as she took
a chair on the porch. &#8220;So you&#8217;re back for
the summer, Lyman.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. Aren&#8217;t you delighted?&#8221;
He smiled at her teasingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m back to
the &#8216;sauerkraut patch&#8217; again. Glory, I
wish Dad would sell out and move to some decent place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; she grunted, refraining from speech.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. I loathe this Dutch, poky
old place. The only reason I&#8217;m glad to ever
see it again is because you live here. That&#8217;s
the only excuse I have to be glad to see Lancaster
County. And that reminds me, Amanda, have you forgotten
what I told you at the Spelling Bee? Do you still
feel you don&#8217;t want to tackle the job of reforming
me? Come, now,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;give a fellow
a bit of hope to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I told you no, Lyman. I don&#8217;t
change my mind so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, you naughty girl!&#8221;
came Isabel&#8217;s sweet voice as she drifted to the
porch. &#8220;I looked all over the house for you,
Amanda, and here I find you entertaining a charming
young man.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Isabel was lovely as usual. Amanda
introduced Lyman to her and as the honeyed words fell
from the lips of the city girl the country girl stood
contemplating the pair before her. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the first time,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I was glad
to hear that voice. I do wish those two would be attracted
to each other. They match in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Lyman Mertzheimer was not seriously
attracted to Isabel, but he was at times a keen strategist
and the moment he saw the city girl an idea lodged
in his brain. Here was a pretty girl who could, no
doubt, easily be made to accept attentions from him.
By Jove, he&#8217;d make Amanda jealous! He&#8217;d
play with Isabel, shower attentions upon her until
Amanda would see what she missed by snubbing a Mertzheimer!</p>

<p align="left">The following week was a busy one
for Isabel. Lyman danced attendance every day. He
developed a sudden affection for Lancaster County and
took Isabel over the lovely roads of that Garden Spot.
They visited the Cloister at Ephrata, the museum of
antiques at Manheim, the beautiful Springs Park at
Lititz, the interesting, old-fashioned towns scattered
along the road. Over state highways they sped along
in his green roadster, generally going like Jehu,
furiously. The girl enjoyed the riding more than the
society of the man. He was exulting in the thought
that he must be peeving Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">Nevertheless, at the end of Isabel&#8217;s
visit, Lyman was obliged to acknowledge to himself,
&#8220;All my fooling round with the other girl never
phased Amanda! Kick me for a fool! I&#8217;ll have
to think up some other way to make her take notice
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin Landis came in for the small
portion those days. How could he really enjoy his
evenings at the Reist house when Lyman Mertzheimer
sat there like an evil presence with his smirking
smile and his watchful eyes ever open! Some of the
zest went out of Martin&#8217;s actions. His exuberance
decreased. It was a relief to him when the boarder&#8217;s
parents returned from their trip and the girl went
home. He had her invitation to call at her home in
Lancaster. Surely, there Lyman would not sit like
the black raven of Poe&#8217;s poem! Isabel would not
forget him even when she was once more in the city!
Martin Landis was beginning to think the world a fine
old place, after all. He was going to school, had
prospects of securing a position after his own desires,
thanks to Isabel Souders, he had the friendship of
a talented, charming city girl--what added bliss the
future held for him he did not often dream about.
The present held enough joy for him.</p>

<a name="ch12"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XII</h1>

<h2 align="center">Unhappy Days</h2>

<p align="left">That September Amanda went back to
her second year of teaching at Crow Hill. She went
bearing a heavy heart. It was hard to concentrate her
full attention on reading, spelling and arithmetic.
She needed constantly to summon all her will power
to keep from dreaming and holding together her tottering
castles in Spain.</p>

<p align="left">From the little Landis children, pupils
in her school, she heard unsolicited bits of gossip
about Martin--"Our Mart, he&#8217;s got a girl in
Lancaster.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t talk
like that!&#8221; Amanda interrupted, feeling conscience
stricken.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, that don&#8217;t matter,&#8221;
came the frank reply; &#8220;it ain&#8217;t no secret.
Pop and Mom tease him about it lots of times. He gets
all dressed up still evenings and takes the trolley
to Lancaster to see his girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he goes in on business.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Business--you bet not! Not
every week and sometimes twice a week would he go
on business. He&#8217;s got a girl and I heard Mom
tell Pop in Dutch that she thinks it&#8217;s that
there Isabel that boarded at your house last summer
once. Mom said she wished she could meet her, then
she&#8217;d feel better satisfied. We don&#8217;t
want just anybody to get our Mart. But I guess anybody
he&#8217;d pick out would be all right, don&#8217;t
you, Aman--I mean, Miss Reist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so--of course she would,&#8221;
Amanda agreed.</p>

<p align="left">One winter day Martin himself mentioned
the name of Isabel to Amanda. He stopped in at the
Reist farm, seeming his old friendly self. &#8220;I
came in to tell you good news,&#8221; he told Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now what?&#8221; asked Millie,
who was in the room with Mrs. Reist and Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been appointed to
a place in the bank at Lancaster.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good! I&#8217;m so glad, Martin!&#8221;
cried the girl with genuine interest and joy. &#8220;It&#8217;s
what you wanted, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. But I would never have
landed it so soon if it hadn&#8217;t been for Mr.
Souders, Isabel&#8217;s father. He&#8217;s influential
in the city and he helped me along. Now it&#8217;s
up to me to make good.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You&#8217;ll do that, I&#8217;m
sure you will!&#8221; came the spontaneous reply.</p>

<p align="left">Martin looked at the bright, friendly
face of Amanda. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;how
pleased she is! She&#8217;s a great little pal.&#8221;
For a moment the renewed friendliness of childhood
days was awakened in him.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say, Amanda,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;we haven&#8217;t had a good tramp for ages.
I&#8217;ve been so busy with school"--he flushed,
thinking of the city girl to whom he had been giving
so much of his time--"and--well, I&#8217;ve been at
it pretty hard for a while. Now I&#8217;ll just keep
on with my correspondence work but I&#8217;ll have
a little more time. Shall we take a tramp Sunday afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;If you want to,&#8221; the
girl responded, her heart pounding with pleasure.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda dressed her prettiest for that
winter tramp. She remembered Queen Esther, who had
put on royal apparel to win the favor of the king.
The country girl, always making the most of her good
features and coloring, was simply, yet becomingly
dressed when she met Martin in the Reist sitting-room.
In her brown suit, little brown hat pulled over her
red hair, a brown woolly scarf thrown over her shoulders,
she looked like a creature of the woodland she loved.</p>

<p align="left">That walk in the afternoon sunshine
which warmed slightly the cold, snowy earth, was a
happy one to both. Some of the old comradeship sprang
up, mushroom-like, as they climbed the rail fence and
entered the woods where they had so often sought wild
flowers and birds&#8217; nests. Martin spoke frankly
of his work and his ambition to advance. Amanda was
a good listener, a quality always appreciated by a
man. When he had told his hopes and aspirations to
her he began to take interest in her affairs. Her
school, funny incidents occurring there, her basket
work with the children--all were talked about, until
Amanda in dazed fashion brushed her hand across her
eyes and wondered whether Isabel and her wiles was
all an hallucination.</p>

<p align="left">But the subject came round all too
soon. They were speaking of the Victrola recently
purchased for the Crow Hill school when Martin asked,
&#8220;Have you ever heard Isabel Souders play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at Millersville. She often played at recitals.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She&#8217;s great! Isn&#8217;t
she great at a piano! She&#8217;s been good enough
to invite me in there. Sometimes she plays for me.
The first time she played ragtime but I told her I
hate that stuff. She said she&#8217;s versatile, can
please any taste. So now she entertains me with those
lovely, dreamy things that almost talk to you. She&#8217;s
taught me to play cards, too. I haven&#8217;t said
anything about it at home, they wouldn&#8217;t understand.
Mother and Father still consider cards wicked. I dare
say it wouldn&#8217;t be just the thing for Mennonites
to play cards, but I fail to see any harm in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No--but your mother would be hurt if she knew
it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She won&#8217;t know it. I
wouldn&#8217;t do anything wrong, but Mother doesn&#8217;t
understand about such things. The only place I play
is at Isabel&#8217;s home. It&#8217;s an education
to be taken into a fine city home like theirs and
treated as an equal.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;An equal! Why, Martin Landis,
you are an equal! If a good, honest country boy isn&#8217;t
as good as a butterfly city girl I&#8217;d like to
know who is! Aren&#8217;t your people and mine as
good as any others in the whole world? Even if the
men do eat in their shirt sleeves and the women can&#8217;t
tell an oyster fork from a salad one.&#8221; The fine
face of the girl was flushed and eager as she went
on, &#8220;Of course, these days young people should
learn all the little niceties of correct table manners
so they can eat anywhere and not be embarrassed. But
I&#8217;ll never despise any middle-aged or old people
just because they eat with a knife or pour coffee
into a saucer or commit any other similar transgression.
It&#8217;s a matter of man-made style, after all. When
our grannies were young the proper way to do was to
pour coffee into the saucers. Why, we have a number
of little glass plates made just for the purpose of
holding the cup after the coffee had been poured into
the saucer. The cup-plates saved the cloth from stains
of the drippings on the cup. I heard a prominent lecturer
say we should not be so quick to condemn people who
do not eat as we think they should. He said, apropos
of eating with a knife or, according to present usage,
with a fork, that it&#8217;s just a little matter
of the difference between pitching it in or shoveling
it in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin laughed. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing of the snob about you, is there? I believe
you see the inside of people without much looking on
the exterior.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Shall we turn back now? I&#8217;m cold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She was cold, but it was an inward
reaction from the joy of being with Martin again.
His words about Isabel and his glad recounting of the
hours he spent with her chilled the girl. She felt
that he was becoming more deeply entangled in the
web Isabel spun for him. To the country girl&#8217;s
observant, analytical mind it seemed almost impossible
that a girl of Isabel&#8217;s type could truly love
a plain man like Martin Landis or could ever make
him happy if she married him.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s just one more conquest
for her to boast about,&#8221; Amanda thought. &#8220;Just
as the mate of the Jack-in-the-pulpit invites the insects
to her honey and then catches them in a hopeless trap,
so women like Isabel play with men like Martin. No
wonder the root of the Jack-in-the-pulpit is bitter--it&#8217;s
symbolic of the aftermath of the honeyed trap.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Worried, unhappy though she was, Amanda&#8217;s
second year of teaching was, in the opinion of the
pupils, highly successful. Some of the wonder-thoughts
of her heart she succeeded in imparting to them in
that little rural school. As she tugged at the bell
rope and sent the ding-dong pealing over the countryside
with its call that brought the children from many
roads and byways she felt an irresistible thrill pulsating
through her. It was as if the big bell called, &#8220;Here,
come here, come here! We&#8217;ll teach you knowledge
from books, and that rarer thing, wisdom. We&#8217;ll
teach you in this little square room the meaning of
the great outside world, how to meet the surging tide
of the cities and battle squarely. We&#8217;ll show
you how to carry to commerce and business and professional
life the honesty and wholesomeness and sincerity of
the country. We&#8217;ll teach you that sixteen ounces
make a pound and show you why you must never forget
that, but must keep exalted and unstained the high
standards of courage and right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Some world-old philosophical conception
of the insignificance of her own joys and sorrows
as compared with the magnitude of the earth and its
vast solar system came to her at times.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My life,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;seems so important to me and yet it is so little
a thing to weep about if my days are not as full of
joy as I want them to be. I must step out from myself,
detach myself and get a proper perspective. After
all, my little selfish wants and yearnings are so
small a portion of the whole scheme of things.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8217;For all that laugh, and all that
weep<br>
&#160;&#160;And all that breathe are one<br>
&#160;&#160;Slight ripple on the boundless deep<br>
&#160;&#160;That moves, and all is gone.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Looking back over the winter months
of that second year of teaching Amanda sometimes wondered
how she was able to do her work in the schoolroom
acceptably. But the strain of being a stoic left its
marks upon her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; said Aunt
Rebecca one day in February when a blizzard held her
snowbound at the Reist farmhouse, &#8220;that girl
must be doin&#8217; too much with this teachin&#8217;
and basket makin&#8217; and who knows what not! She
looks pale and sharp-chinned. Ain&#8217;t you noticed?&#8221;
she asked Mrs. Reist.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I thought last week she looked
pinched and I asked if she felt bad but she said she
felt all right, she was just a little bit tired sometimes.
I guess teachin&#8217; forty boys and girls ain&#8217;t
any too easy, Becky.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, no! I&#8217;d
rather tend hogs all day! But why don&#8217;t you make
a big crock of boneset tea and make her take a good
swallow every day? There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; like
that to build abody up. She looks real bad--you don&#8217;t
want her to go in consumption like that Ellie Hess
over near my place.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, mercy no! Becky, how you
scare abody! I&#8217;ll fix her up some boneset tea
to-day yet. I got some on the garret that Millie dried
last summer.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda protested against the boneset
but to please her mother she promised to swallow faithfully
the doses of bitter tea. She thought whimsically as
she drank it, &#8220;First time I knew that boneset
tea is good for an aching heart. Boneset tea--it isn&#8217;t
that I want! I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m losing hold
of my old faith in the ultimate triumph of sincerity
and truth. Seems that men, even men like Martin Landis,
don&#8217;t want the old-fashioned virtues in a woman.
They don&#8217;t look for womanly qualities, but prefer
to be amused and entertained and flattered and appealed
to through the senses. Brains and heart don&#8217;t
seem to count. I wish I could be a butterfly! But
I can never be like Isabel. When she is near I feel
like a bump-on-a-log. My tongue is like lead while
she chatters and holds the attention of Martin. She
compels attention and crowds out everybody else. Oh,
yea! as we youngsters used to say when things went
wrong when we were little. Perhaps things will come
out right some day. I&#8217;ll just keep on taking
that boneset tea!&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch13"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIII</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Trouble Maker</h2>

<p align="left">If &#8220;Hell hath no fury like a
woman scorned&#8221; a man spurned in love sometimes
runs a close second.</p>

<p align="left">One day in March Lyman Mertzheimer
came home for the week-end. His first thought was
to call at the Reist home.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda, outwardly improved--Millie
said, &#8220;All because of that there boneset tea"--welcomed
spring and its promise, but she could not extend to
Lyman Mertzheimer the same degree of welcome.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s that Lyman again,&#8221;
Millie reported after she had opened the door for
the caller. &#8220;He looks kinda mad about something.
What&#8217;s he hangin&#8217; round here for all the
time every time he gets home from school when abody
can easy see you don&#8217;t like him to come?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. He
just drops in. I guess because we were youngsters
together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um, mebbe,&#8221; grunted Millie
wisely to herself as Amanda went to see her visitor.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t blind and neither did I come in
the world yesterday. That Lyman&#8217;s wantin&#8217;
to be Amanda&#8217;s beau and she don&#8217;t want
him. Guess he&#8217;ll stand watchin&#8217; if he
gets turned down. I never did like them Mertzheimers--all
so up in the air they can hardly stand still to look
at abody.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Lyman was standing at the window,
looking out gloomily. He turned as Amanda came into
the room.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I had to come, Amanda--hang
it, you keep a fellow on pins and needles! You wouldn&#8217;t
answer my letters--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you not to write.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But why? Aren&#8217;t you going
to change your mind? I made up my mind long ago that
I&#8217;d marry you some day and a Mertzheimer is a
good deal like a bulldog when it comes to hanging
on.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Lyman, why hash the thing over
so often? I don&#8217;t care for you. Go find some
nice girl who will care for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um,&#8221; he said dejectedly,
&#8220;I want you. I thought you just wanted to be
coaxed, but I&#8217;m beginning to think you mean it.
So you don&#8217;t care for me--I suppose you&#8217;d
snatch Martin Landis in a hurry if you could get him!
But he&#8217;s poor as a church mouse! You better tie
him to your apron strings--that pretty Souders girl
from Lancaster is playing her cards there--&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda sprang to her feet. &#8220;Lyman,&#8221;
she sputtered--"you--you better go before I make you
sorry you said that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The luckless lover laughed, a reckless,
demoniac peal. &#8220;Two can play at that game!&#8221;
he told her. &#8220;You&#8217;re so high and mighty
that a Mertzheimer isn&#8217;t good enough for you.
But you better look out--we&#8217;ve got claws!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The girl turned and went out of the
room. A moment later she heard the front door slammed
and knew that Lyman had gone. His covert threat--
what did he mean? What vengeance could he wreak on
her? Oh, what a complicated riddle life had grown
to be! She remembered Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s warning
that tears would have to balance all the laughter.
How she yearned for the old, happy childhood days
to come back to her! She clutched frantically at the
quickly departing joy and cheerfulness of that far-off
past.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep my
sense of humor and my faith in things in spite of
anything that comes to me,&#8221; she promised herself,
&#8220;even if they do have to give me boneset tea
to jerk me up a bit!&#8221; She laughed at Millie&#8217;s
faith in the boneset tea. &#8220;I hope it also takes
the meanness and hate out of my heart. Why, just now
I hate Lyman! If he really cared for me I&#8217;d
feel sorry for him, but he doesn&#8217;t love me, he
just wants to marry me because long ago he decided
he would do so some day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">In spite of her determination to be
philosophical and cheerful, the memory of Lyman&#8217;s
threat returned to her at times in a baffling way.
What could he mean? How could he harm her? His father
was a director of the Crow Hill school, but pshaw!
One director couldn&#8217;t put her out of her place
in the school!</p>

<p align="left">Lyman Mertzheimer had only a few days
to carry out the plan formulated in his angry mind
as he walked home after the tilt with Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll show her,&#8221;
he snorted, &#8220;the disagreeable thing! I&#8217;ll
show her what can happen when she turns down a Mertzheimer!
The very name Mertzheimer means wealth and high standing!
And she puts up her nose and tosses her red head at
me and tells me she won&#8217;t have me! She&#8217;ll
see what a Mertzheimer can do!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The elder Mertzheimer, school director,
was not unlike his son. When the young man came to
him with an exaggerated tale of the contemptible way
Amanda had treated him, thrown him over as though he
were nobody, Mr. Mertzheimer, Senior, sympathized
with his aggrieved son and stormed and vowed he&#8217;d
see if he&#8217;d vote for that red-headed snip of
a teacher next year. The Reists thought they were
somebody, anyhow, and they had no more money than
he had, perhaps not so much. What right had she to
be ugly to Lyman when he did her the honor to ask her
to marry him? The snip! He&#8217;d show her!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But one vote won&#8217;t keep
her out of the school,&#8221; said Lyman with diplomatic
unconcern.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Leave it to me, boy! I&#8217;ll
talk a few of them over. There was some complaint
last year about her not doing things like other school-teachers
round here, and her not being a strict enough teacher.
She teaches geography with a lot of dirt and water.
She has the young ones scurrying round the woods and
fields with nets to catch butterflies. And she lugs
in a lot of corn husk and shows them how to make a
few dinky baskets and thinks she&#8217;s doing some
wonderful thing. For all that she draws her salary
and gets away with all that tomfoolery--guess because
she can smile and humbug some people--them red-headed
women are all like that, boy. She&#8217;s not the
right teacher for Crow Hill school and I&#8217;m going
to make several people see it. Then let her twiddle
her thumbs till she gets a place so near home and
as nice as the Crow Hill school!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mr. Mertzheimer, whose august dignity
had been unpardonably offended, lost no time in seeing
the other directors of the Crow Hill school. He mentioned
nothing about the real grievance against Amanda, but
played upon the slender string of her inefficiency,
as talked about by the patrons. He presented the matter
so tactfully that several of the men were convinced
he spoke from a deep conviction that the interests
of the community were involved and that in all fairness
to the pupils of that rural school a new, competent
teacher should be secured for the ensuing term. One
director, being a man with the unfortunate addiction
of being easily swayed by the opinions of others, was
readily convinced by the plausible arguments of Mr.
Mertzheimer that Amanda Reist was utterly unfit for
the position she held.</p>

<p align="left">When all the directors had been thus
casually imbued with antagonism, or, at least, suspicion,
Mr. Mertzheimer went home, chuckling. He felt elated
at the clever method he had taken to uphold the dignity
of his son and punish the person who had failed to
rightly respect that dignity. In a few weeks the County
Superintendent of Schools would make his annual visit
to Crow Hill, and if &#8220;a bug could be put in his
ear&#8221; and he be influenced to show up the flaws
in the school, everything would be fine! &#8220;Fine
as silk,&#8221; thought Mr. Mertzheimer. He knew a
girl near Landisville who was a senior at Millersville
and would be glad to teach a school like Crow Hill.
He&#8217;d tell her to apply for the position. It
would take about five minutes to put out that independent
Amanda Reist and vote in the other girl--it just takes
some people to plan! He, Mr. Mertzheimer, had planned
it! Probably in his limited education he had never
read that sententious line regarding what often happens
to the best laid plans of mice and men!</p>

<p align="left">The Saturday following Mr. Mertzheimer&#8217;s
perfection of his plans Millie came home from market
greatly excited.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Manda, Manda, come here once!&#8221;
she called as she set her empty baskets on the kitchen
table. &#8220;Just listen,&#8221; she said to the girl,
who came running. &#8220;I heard something to-day!
That old Mertzheimer--he--he--oh, yea, why daren&#8217;t
I swear just this once! I&#8217;m that mad! That old
Mertzheimer and the young one ought to be tarred and
feathered!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, Millie!&#8221; said Amanda,
smiling at the unwonted agitation of the hired girl.
&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, this mornin&#8217; two
girls came to my stall and while they was standin&#8217;
there and I waited on some other lady, they talked.
One asked the other if she was goin&#8217; to teach
next year, and what do you think she said--that a
Mr. Mertzheimer had told her to apply for the Crow
Hill school, that they wanted a new teacher there for
another year! I didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; to
them or let on that I know the teacher of that school,
but I thought a heap. So, you see, that sneakin&#8217;
man is goin&#8217; to put you out if he at all can
do it. And just because you won&#8217;t take up with
that pretty boy of his! Them Mertzheimer people think
they own whole Crow Hill and can run everybody in
it to suit themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes--I see.&#8221; Amanda&#8217;s
face was troubled. &#8220;That&#8217;s Lyman&#8217;s
work.&#8221; The injustice of the thing hurt her.
&#8220;Of course, I can get another school, but I
like Crow Hill, I know the children and we get along
so well, and it&#8217;s near home----&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; came Millie&#8217;s
spirited question, &#8220;surely you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to let Mertzheimers do like they want? I don&#8217;t
believe in this foldin&#8217; hands and lookin&#8217;
meek and leavin&#8217; people use you for a shoe mat!
Here, come in once till I tell you somethin&#8217;,&#8221;
she called as Mrs. Reist, Philip and Uncle Amos came
through the yard. She repeated her account of the
news the strangers had unwittingly imparted to her
at market.</p>

<p>&#8220;The skunk,&#8221; said Philip.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Skunk?&#8221; repeated Uncle
Amos. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t insult the little black
and white furry fellow like that! A skunk&#8217;ll
trot off and mind his own business if you leave him
alone, and, anyhow, he&#8217;ll put up his tail for
a danger signal so you know what&#8217;s comin&#8217;
if you hang around.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the
boy, &#8220;call him a snake, a rattlesnake.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And that&#8217;s not quite
hittin&#8217; the mark, either. A rattlesnake rattles
before he strikes. I say mean people are more like
the copperhead, that hides in the grass and leaves
that are like its own color, and when you ain&#8217;t
expectin&#8217; it and without any warnin&#8217;, he&#8217;ll
up and strike you with his poison fangs. What are
you goin&#8217; to do about it, Amanda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? I&#8217;ll do nothing. What can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You might go round and see
the directors and ask them to vote for you,&#8221;
suggested Millie. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let them
people get the best of me --just for spite now I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I won&#8217;t ask for one vote!&#8221;
Amanda was decided in that. &#8220;The men on the
board have had a chance to see how the school is run,
and if it doesn&#8217;t please them, or if they are
going to have one man rule them and tell them how
to vote--let them go! I&#8217;ll hand in my application,
that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What for need you be so stiff-headed?&#8221;
asked Millie sadly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll spite us all
if they put you out and you go off somewheres to teach.
Ach, abody wonders sometimes why some people got to
be so mean in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It is always that way,&#8221;
said Mrs. Reist gently. &#8220;There are weeds everywhere,
even in this Garden Spot. Why, I found a stalk of deadly
nightshade in my rose-bed last summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wheat and chaff, I guess,&#8221; was Uncle
Amos&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But, Amanda,&#8221; asked Millie,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t there some person over the directors,
boss over them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Just the County Superintendent,
and he&#8217;s not really boss over them. He comes
round to the schools every year and the directors come
with him and, of course, if he blames a teacher they
hear it, and if he praises one they hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um--so--I see,&#8221; said Millie.</p>

<a name="ch14"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIV</h1>

<h2 align="center">The County Superintendent&#8217;s Visit</h2>

<p align="left">The annual visit of the County Superintendent
of Schools always carries with it some degree of anxiety
for the teacher. Sometimes the visit comes unexpectedly,
but generally the news is sent round in some manner,
and last minute polish and coachings are given for
the hour of trial. The teacher, naturally eager to
make a creditable showing, never knows what vagaries
of stupidity will seize her brightest pupils and cause
them to stand helpless and stranded as she questions
them in the presence of the distinguished visitor
and critic.</p>

<p align="left">The Superintendent came to the Crow
Hill school on a blustery March day of the sort that
blows off hats and tries the tempers of the sweetest
natured people. Amanda thought she never before lived
through hours so long as those in which she waited
for the visitors. But at length came the children&#8217;s
subdued, excited announcement, &#8220;Here they come!&#8221;
as the grind of wheels sounded outside the windows.
A few minutes later the hour was come--the County
Superintendent and the directors, Mr. Mertzheimer
in the lead, stepped into the little room, shook hands
with the teacher, then seated themselves and waited
for Amanda to go on with her regular lessons and prove
her efficiency.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda, stirred by the underhand workings
of Mr. Mertzheimer, was on her mettle. She&#8217;d
just show that man she could teach! Two years&#8217;
experience in handling rural school classes came to
her support. With precision, yet unhurried, she conducted
classes in geography, grammar, reading, arithmetic,
some in beginners&#8217; grades and others in the
advanced classes.</p>

<p align="left">She saved her trump card for the last,
her nature class, in which the children told from
the colored pictures that formed a frieze above the
blackboard, the names of fifty native birds and gave
a short sketch of their habits, song or peculiarities.</p>

<p align="left">After that the pupils sang for the
visitors. During that time the eyes of the Superintendent
traveled about the room, from the pressed and mounted
leaves and flowers on the walls to the corn-husk and
grass baskets on a table in the rear of the room.</p>

<p align="left">When the children&#8217;s part was
ended came the time they loved best, that portion
of the visit looked forward to each year, the address
of the County Superintendent. He was a tall man, keen-eyed
and kindly, and as he stood before the little school
the eyes of every child were upon him--he&#8217;d
be sure to say something funny before he sat down--he
always did!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, boys and girls, here
we are again! And, as the old Pennsylvania Dutch preacher
said, &#8217;I&#8217;m glad that I can say that I&#8217;m
glad that I&#8217;m here.&#8217; &#8220;He rattled
off the words in rapid Pennsylvania Dutch, at which
the children laughed and some whispered, &#8220;Why,
he can talk the Dutch, too!&#8221; Then they listened
in rapt attention as the speaker went on:</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Last year my hour in this schoolroom
was one of the high-lights of my visits to the rural
schools of the county. So I expected big things from
you this year, and it gives me great pleasure to tell
you that I am not disappointed. I might go farther
and tell you the truth--I am more than pleased with
the showing of this school. I listened attentively
while all the classes were in session, and your answers
showed intelligent thinking and reasoning. You had
a surprise for me in that bird class. I like that!
It&#8217;s a great idea to learn from colored pictures
the names of our birds, for by so doing you will be
able to identify them readily when you meet them in
the fields and woods. No lover of birds need fear
that one of you will rob a bird&#8217;s nest or use
a sling-shot on a feathered neighbor. You show by your
stories about the birds that a proper regard and appreciation
for them has been fostered in you by your teacher.
You all know that it has long been acknowledged that
&#8216;An honest confession is good for the soul,&#8217;
so I&#8217;m going to be frank and tell you that as
Miss Reist pointed to the birds there were thirty
out of the fifty that I did not know. I have learned
something of great value with you here to-day, and
I promise you that I&#8217;m going to buy a book and
study about them so that when I come to see you next
year I&#8217;ll know every one of your pictures. You
make me feel ashamed of my meagre knowledge of our
feathered neighbors on whom, indirectly, our very
existence depends.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I made mention last year about
your fine work in basketry, and am glad to do so again.
I like your teacher&#8217;s idea of utilizing native
material, corn husk, dried grasses and reeds, all from
our own Garden Spot, and a few colored strands of
raffia from Madagascar, and forming them into baskets.
This faculty of using apparently useless material
and fashioning from it a useful and beautiful article
is one of our Pennsylvania Dutch heritages and one
we should cherish and develop.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I understand there has been
some adverse criticism among a few of the less liberal
patrons of the community in regard to the basket work
and nature study Miss Reist is teaching. Oh, I suppose
we must expect that! Progress is always hampered by
sluggish stupidity and contrariness. We who can see
into the future and read the demands of the times must
surely note that the children must be taught more than
the knowledge contained between the covers of our
school books. The teacher who can instil into the
hearts of her pupils a feeling of kinship with the
wild creatures of the fields and woods, who can waken
in the children an appreciation of the beauty and
symmetry of the flowers, even the weeds, and at the
same time not fail in her duty as a teacher of arithmetic,
history, and so forth, is a real teacher who has the
proper conception of her high calling and is conscientiously
striving to carry that conception into action.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Directors, let me make this
public statement to you, that in Miss Reist you have
a teacher well worthy of your heartiest cooperation.
The danger with us who have been out of school these
thirty years or more is that we expect to see the
antiquated methods of our own school days in operation
to-day. We would have the schools stand still while
the whole world moves.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I feel it is only just to commend
a teacher&#8217;s work when it deserves commendation,
as I consider it my duty to point out the flaws and
name any causes for regret I may discover in her teaching.
In this school I have found one big cause for regret---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The hard eyes of Mr. Mertzheimer flashed.
All through the glowing praise of the County Superintendent
the schemer had sat with head cast down and face flushed
in mortification and anger. Now his head was erect.
Good! That praise was just a bluff! That red-head would
get a good hard knock now! Good enough for her! Now
she&#8217;d wish she had not turned down the son of
the leading director of Crow Hill school! Perhaps
now she&#8217;d be glad to accept the attentions of
Lyman. Marriage would be a welcome solution to her
troubles when she lost her position in the school
so near home. The Superintendent was not unmindful
of that &#8220;flea in his ear,&#8221; after all.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I have found one cause for
regret,&#8221; the speaker repeated slowly, &#8220;one
big cause.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">His deep, feeling voice stopped and
he faced the school while the hearts of pupils and
teacher beat with apprehension.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And that regret is,&#8221;
he said very slowly so that not one word of his could
be lost, &#8220;that I have not a dozen teachers just
like Miss Reist to scatter around the county!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda&#8217;s lips trembled. The
relief and happiness occasioned by the words of the
speaker almost brought her to tears. The children,
appreciating the compliment to their teacher, clapped
hands until the little room resounded with deafening
noise.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said
the distinguished visitor, smiling, as the applause
died down. &#8220;You stick to your teacher like that
and follow her lead and I am sure you will develop
into men and women of whom Lancaster County will be
proud.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After a few more remarks, a joke or
two, he went back to his seat with the directors.
Mr. Mertzheimer avoided meeting his eyes. The father
of Lyman Mertzheimer, who had been so loud in his
denunciation of the tomfoolery baskets and dried weeds,
suddenly developed an intense interest in a tray of
butterflies and milkweed.</p>

<p align="left">In a few minutes it was time for dismissal.
One of the older girls played a simple march on the
little organ and the scholars marched from the room.
With happy faces they said good-bye, eager to run home
and tell all about the visit of the County Superintendent
and the things he said.</p>

<p align="left">As the visitors rose to go the County
Superintendent stepped away from the others and went
to Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You have been very kind,&#8221;
she told him, joy showing in her animated face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Honor to whom honor is due,
Miss Reist,&#8221; he said, with that winning smile
of approval so many teachers worked to win. &#8220;I
have here a little thing I want you to read after
we leave. It is a copy of a letter you might like
to keep, though I feel certain the writer of it would
feel embarrassed if told of your perusal of it. I
want to add that I should have felt the same and made
similar remarks to-day if I had not read that letter,
but probably I should not have expressed my opinion
quite so forcibly. Keep the letter. I intend to keep
the original. It renews faith in human nature in general.
It makes me feel anew how good a thing it is to have
a friend. Good-bye, Miss Reist. I have enjoyed my
visit to Crow Hill school, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda looked at him, wondering. What
under the sun could he mean? Why should she read a
letter written to him? She smiled, shook the hand he
offered, but was still at a loss to understand his
words. The directors came up to say good-bye. Mr.
Mertzheimer bowed very politely but refrained from
meeting her eyes as he said, &#8220;Good-afternoon.&#8221;
The other men did not bow but they added to their
good-bye, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to vote for you.
We don&#8217;t want to lose you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda&#8217;s heart sang as the two
carriages rolled away and she was left alone in the
schoolroom. She had seen the device of the wicked come
to naught, she gloried in the fact that the mean and
unfair was once more overbalanced by the just and
kind. After the tribute from the County Superintendent
and the promises from all the directors but Mr. Mertzheimer
she felt assured that she would not be ignominiously
put out of the school she loved. Then she thought
of the letter and opened it hastily, her eyes traveling
fast over the long sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Mister</i>,</p>

<p align="left">Maybe it ain&#8217;t polite to write
to you when you don&#8217;t know me but I got a favor
to ask you and I don&#8217;t know no other way to do
it. Amanda Reist is teacher of the Crow Hill school
and she is a good one, everybody says so but a few
old cranks that don&#8217;t know nothing. There&#8217;s
one of the directors on the school board has got a
son that ain&#8217;t worth a hollow bean and he wants
Amanda should take him for her beau. She&#8217;s got
too much sense for that, our Amanda can get a better
man than Lyman Mertzheimer I guess. But now since
she won&#8217;t have nothing to do with him he&#8217;s
got his pop to get her out her school. The old man
has asked another girl to ask for the job and he&#8217;s
talked a lot about Amanda till some of the other directors
side with him. He&#8217;s rich and a big boss and
things got to go his way. Most everybody says Amanda&#8217;s
a good teacher, the children run to meet her and they
learn good with her. I heard her say you was coming
to visit the school soon and that the directors mostly
come with you and I just found out where you live and
am writing this to tell you how it is. Perhaps if
you like her school and would do it to tell them directors
so it would help her. It sometimes helps a lot when
a big person takes the side of the person being tramped
on. Amanda is too high strung to ask any of the directors
to stick to her. She says they can see what kind of
work she does and if they want to let one man run
the school board and run her out she&#8217;ll go out.
But she likes that school and it&#8217;s near her
home and we&#8217;d all feel bad if she got put out
and went off somewheres far to teach. I&#8217;m just
the hired girl at her house but I think a lot of her.
I will say thanks very much for what you can do.</p>

<p>And oblige, AMELIA <i>Hess</i>.</p>

<p align="left">P. S. I forgot to say Amanda don&#8217;t
know I have wrote this. I guess she wouldn&#8217;t
leave me send it if she did.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Tears of happiness rolled down the
girl&#8217;s face as she ended the reading of the
letter. &#8220;The dear thing! The loyal old body she
is! So that was why she borrowed my dictionary and
shut herself up in her room one whole evening! Just
a hired girl she says--could any blood relative do
a kinder deed? Oh, I don&#8217;t wonder he said it
renews faith in human nature! I guess for every Mertzheimer
there&#8217;s a Millie. I&#8217;ll surely keep this
letter but I won&#8217;t let her know I have any idea
about what she did. I&#8217;m so glad he gave it to
me. It takes the bitter taste from my mouth and makes
life pleasant again. Now I&#8217;ll run home with the
news of the Superintendent&#8217;s visit and the nice
things he said.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She did run, indeed, especially when
she reached the yard of her home. By the time the
gate clicked she was near the kitchen door. Millie
was rolling out pies, Mrs. Reist was paring apples.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother,&#8221; the girl twined
an arm about the neck of the white-capped woman and
kissed her fervently on the cheek, &#8220;I&#8217;m
so excited! Oh, Millie,&#8221; she treated the astonished
woman to the same expression of love.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What now?&#8221; said Millie.
&#8220;Now you got that flour all over your nice dress.
What ails you, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, just joy. The Superintendent
was here and he puffed me way up to the skies and
the directors, all but Mr. Mertzheimer, promised to
vote for me. I didn&#8217;t ask them too, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; said Mrs. Reist.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, now ain&#8217;t that nice!
I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Millie, her face bright
with joy. &#8220;So he puffed you up in front of them
men? That was powerful nice for him to do, but just
what you earned, I guess. I bet that settled the Mertzheimer
hash once! That County man knows his business. He ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; through the world blind. What all did he
say?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, he was lovely. He liked
the baskets and the classes and the singing and--everything!
And Mr Mertzheimer looked madder than a setting hen
when you take her off the nest. He hung his head like
a whipped dog.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Na-ha!&#8221; exulted Millie.
&#8220;That&#8217;s one time that he didn&#8217;t have
his own way once! I bet he gets out of the school
board if he can&#8217;t run it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Her prediction came true. Mr. Mertzheimer&#8217;s
dignity would not tolerate such trampling under foot.
If that red-headed teacher was going to keep the school
he&#8217;d get out and let the whole thing go to smash!
He got out, but to his surprise, nothing went to smash.
An intelligent farmer, more amenable to good judgment,
was elected to succeed him and the Crow Hill school
affairs went smoothly. In due time Amanda Reist was
elected by unanimous vote to teach for the ensuing
year and the Mertzheimers, thwarted, nursed their
wrath, and sat down to think of other avenues of attack.</p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XV</h1>

<h2 align="center">&#8220;Martin&#8217;s Girl&#8221;</h2>

<p align="left">If the securing of the coveted school,
the assurance of the good will and support of the
patrons and directors, and the love of the dear home
folks was a combination of blessings ample enough to
bring perfect happiness, then Amanda Reist should
have been in that state during the long summer months
of her vacation. But, after the perverseness of human
nature, there was one thing lacking, only one--her
knight, Martin Landis.</p>

<p align="left">During the long, bright summer days
Amanda worked on the farm, helped Millie faithfully,
but she was never so busily occupied with manual labor
that she did not take time now and then to sit idly
under some tree and dream, adding new and wonderful
turrets to her golden castles in Spain.</p>

<p align="left">She remembered with a whimsical, wistful
smile the pathetic Romance of the Swan&#8217;s Nest
and the musing of Little Ellie--</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;I will have a lover,<br>
&#160;&#160;Riding on a steed of steeds;<br>
&#160;&#160;He shall love me without guile,<br>
&#160;&#160;And to him I will discover<br>
&#160;&#160;The swan&#8217;s nest among the reeds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#8220;And the steed shall be red-roan,<br>
&#160;&#160;And the lover shall be noble"--</p>

<p align="left">and so on, into a rhapsody of the
valor of her lover, such as only a romantic child
could picture. But, alas! As the dream comes to the
grand climax and Little Ellie, &#8220;Her smile not
yet ended,&#8221; goes to see what more eggs were
with the two in the swan&#8217;s nest, she finds,</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Lo, the wild swan had deserted,<br>
&#160;&#160;And a rat had gnawed the reeds!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Was it usually like that? Amanda wondered.
Were reality and dreams never coincident? Was the
romance of youth just a pretty bubble whose rainbow
tints would soon be pierced and vanish into vapor?
Castles in Spain--were they so ethereal that never
by any chance could they--at least some semblance
to them--be duplicated in reality?</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold on to my castles
in Spain!&#8221; she cried to her heart. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
keep on hoping, I won&#8217;t let go,&#8221; she said,
as though, like Jacob of old, she were wrestling for
a blessing.</p>

<p align="left">Many afternoons she brought her sewing
to the front porch and sat there as Martin passed
by on his way home from the day&#8217;s work at Lancaster.
His cordial, &#8220;Hello&#8221; was friendly enough
but it afforded scant joy to the girl who knew that
all his leisure hours were spent with the attractive
Isabel Souders.</p>

<p align="left">Martin was friendly enough, but that
was handing her a stone when she wanted bread.</p>

<p align="left">One June morning she was working in
the yard as he went by on his way to the bank. A great
bunch of his mother&#8217;s pink spice roses was in
his arm. He was earlier, too, than usual. Probably
he was taking the flowers to Isabel.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he called to
the girl. &#8220;You&#8217;re almost a stranger, Amanda.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He was not close enough to see the
tremble of her lips as she called back, &#8220;Not
quite, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, Mother said this morning
that she has not seen you for several weeks. You used
to come down to play with the babies but now your
visits are few and far between. Mother said she misses
you, Amanda. Why don&#8217;t you run down to see her
when you have time?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, Martin, I will.
It is some time since I&#8217;ve had a good visit
with your mother. I&#8217;ll be down soon.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do, she&#8217;ll be glad,&#8221;
he said and went down the road to the trolley.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Almost a stranger,&#8221; mused
the girl after he was gone. Then she thought of the
old maid who had answered a query thus, &#8220;Why
ain&#8217;t I married? Goodness knows, it ain&#8217;t
my fault!&#8221; Amanda&#8217;s saving sense of humor
came to her rescue and banished the tears.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll run over to
see Mrs. Landis a while this afternoon. It is a long
time since I&#8217;ve been there. I do enjoy being
with her. She&#8217;s such a cheerful person. The
work and noise of nine children doesn&#8217;t bother
her a bit. I don&#8217;t believe she knows what nerves
are.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">That afternoon Amanda walked down
the country road, past the Crow Hill schoolhouse,
to the Landis farm. As she came to the barn-yard she
heard Emma, the youngest Landis child, crying and
an older boy chiding, &#8220;Ah, you big baby! Crying
about a pinched finger! Can&#8217;t you act like a
soldier?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But girls--don&#8217;t be soldiers,&#8221;
said the hurt child, sobbing in childish pain.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda appeared on the scene and went
to the grassy slope of the big bank barn. There she
drew the little girl to her and began to comfort her.
&#8220;Here, let Amanda kiss the finger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurts, it hurts awful, Manda,&#8221; sniffed
the child.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I know it hurts. A pinched
finger hurts a whole lot. You just cry a while and
by that time it will stop hurting.&#8221; She began
to croon to the child the words of an old rhyme she
had picked up somewhere long ago:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Hurt your finger, little lassie?<br>
&#160;&#160;Just you cry a while!<br>
&#160;&#160;For some day your heart will hurt<br>
&#160;&#160;And then you&#8217;ll have to smile.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Time enough to be a stoic<br>
&#160;&#160;In the coming years;<br>
&#160;&#160;Blessed are the days when pain<br>
&#160;&#160;Is washed away by tears.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">By the time the verse was ended the
child&#8217;s attention had been diverted from the
finger to the song and the smiles came back to the
little face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Amanda, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
bathe it in the water at the trough and it will be
entirely well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it won&#8217;t turn into a pig&#8217;s
foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie said it would if I didn&#8217;t stop
cryin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But you stopped crying, you
know, before it could do that. Charlie&#8217;ll pump
water and we&#8217;ll wash all nice and clean and go
in to Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Water from the watering trough in
the barn-yard soon effaced the traces of tears and
a happy trio entered the big yard near the house. An
older boy and Katie Landis came running to meet them.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Amanda,&#8221; said Katie,
&#8220;did you come once! Just at a good time, too!
We&#8217;re gettin&#8217; company for supper and Mom
was wishin&#8217; you&#8217;d come so she could ask
you about settin&#8217; the table. We&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to eat in the room to-night,&#8217;stead of the kitchen
like we do other times. And we&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to have all the good dishes and things out and a bouquet
in the middle of the table when we eat! Ain&#8217;t
that grand? But Pop, he told Mom this morning that
if it&#8217;s as hot to-night as it was this dinner
he won&#8217;t wear no coat to eat, not even if the
Queen of Sheba comes to our place for a meal! But
I guess he only said that for fun, because, ain&#8217;t,
the Queen of Sheba was the one in the Bible that came
to visit Solomon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, she ain&#8217;t comin&#8217;
to us, anyhow. It&#8217;s that Isabel from Lancaster,
Martin&#8217;s girl, that&#8217;s comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Amanda halted on
her way across the lawn. &#8220;What time is she coming?&#8221;
she asked in panicky way, as though she would flee
before the visitor arrived.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, not for long yet! We don&#8217;t
eat till after five. Martin brings her on the trolley
with him when he comes home from the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go in to see
your mother a while.&#8221; A great uneasiness clutched
at the girl&#8217;s heart. Why had she come on that
day?</p>

<p align="left">But Mrs. Landis was glad to see her.
&#8220;Well, Amanda,&#8221; she called through the
kitchen screen, &#8220;you&#8217;re just the person
I said I wished would come. Come right in.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come in the room a while where
it&#8217;s cool,&#8221; she invited as Amanda and
several of the children entered the kitchen. &#8220;I&#8217;m
hot through and through! I just got a short cake mixed
and in the stove. Now I got nothin&#8217; special
to do till it&#8217;s done. I make the old kind yet,
the biscuit dough. Does your mom, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, it&#8217;s better, too,
than this sweet kind some people make. I split it
and put a lot of strawberries on it and we eat it with
cream.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Um, Mom,&#8221; said little
Charlie, &#8220;you make my mouth water still when
you talk about good things like that. I wish it was
supper-time a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And you lookin&#8217; like
that!&#8221; laughed the mother, pointing to his bare
brown legs and feet and his suit that bore evidence
of accidental meetings with grass and ground.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Did they tell you, Amanda,&#8221;
she went on placidly, as she rocked and fanned herself
with a huge palm-leaf fan, &#8220;that we&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; company for supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes--Isabel.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. Martin, he goes in to
see her at Lancaster real often and he&#8217;s all
the time talkin&#8217; about her and wantin&#8217;
we should meet her. She has him to supper--ach, they
call it dinner--but it&#8217;s what they eat in the
evening. I just said to his pop we&#8217;ll ask her
out here to see us once and find out what for girl
she is. From what Martin says she&#8217;s a little
tony and got money and lots of fine things. You know
Martin is the kind can suit himself to most any kind
of people. He can make after every place he goes,
even if they do put on style. So mebbe she thinks
Martin&#8217;s from tony people, too. But when she
comes here she can see that we&#8217;re just plain
country people. I don&#8217;t put no airs on, but I
did say I&#8217;d like to have things nice so that
she can&#8217;t laugh at us, for I&#8217;d pity Martin
if she did that. Mebbe you know how to set the things
on the table a little more like they do now. It&#8217;s
so long since I ate any place tony. I said we&#8217;d
eat in the room, too, and not in the kitchen. We always
eat in the kitchen for it&#8217;s big and handy and
nice and cool with all the doors and windows open.
But I&#8217;ll carry things in the room to-night.
It will please Martin if we have things nice for his
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-huh, Martin&#8217;s got a girl!&#8221; sang
Charlie gleefully.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; spoke up Johnny,
a little older and wiser than Charlie. &#8220;I know
he&#8217;s got a girl. He&#8217;s got a big book in
his room and I seen him once look in it and pick up
something out of it and look at it like it was something
worth a whole lot. I sneaked in after he went off and
what d&#8217;you think it was? Nothing at all but
one of them pink lady-slippers we find in the woods
near the schoolhouse! He pressed it in that book and
acted like it was something precious, so I guess his
girl give it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda remembered the pink lady-slipper.
She had seen Isabel give it to Martin that spring
day when the city girl&#8217;s glowing face had smiled
over the pink azaleas, straight into the eyes of the
country boy.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; chided Mrs.
Landis, &#8220;don&#8217;t you be pokin&#8217; round
in Martin&#8217;s room. And don&#8217;t you tell him
what you saw. He&#8217;d be awful put out. He don&#8217;t
like to be teased. Ach, my,&#8221; she shook her head
and smiled to Amanda, &#8220;with so many children
it makes sometimes when they all get talkin&#8217;
and cuttin&#8217; up or scrappin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But it&#8217;s a lively, merry
place. I always like to come here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do you, now? Well, I like to
have you. I often say to Martin that you&#8217;re
like a streak of sunshine comin&#8217; on a winter
day, always so happy and full of fun, it does abody
good to have you around. Ach"--in answer to a whisper
from the six-year-old baby, &#8220;yes, well, go take
a few cookies. Only put the lid on the crock tight
again so the cookies will keep fresh. Now I guess
I better look after my short cake once. Mister likes
everything baked brown. Then I guess we&#8217;ll set
the table if you don&#8217;t mind tellin&#8217; me
a little how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">While Mrs. Landis went up-stairs to
get her very best table-cloth Amanda looked about
the room with its plain country furnishings, its hominess
and yet utter lack of real artistry in decoration.
Her heart rebelled. What business had a girl like
Isabel Souders to enter a family like the Landis&#8217;s?
She&#8217;d like to bet that the city girl would disdain
the dining-room with its haircloth sofa along one wall
and its organ in one corner, its quaint, silk-draped
mantel where two vases of Pampas grass hobnobbed with
an antique pink and white teapot and two pewter plates;
its lack of buffet or fashionable china closet, its
old, low-backed, cane-seated walnut chairs round a
table, long of necessity to hold plates for so large
a family.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here it is, the finest one
I got. That&#8217;s one I got yet when I went housekeepin&#8217;.
I don&#8217;t use it often, it&#8217;s a little long
for the kitchen table.&#8221; Mrs. Landis proudly
exhibited her old linen table-cloth. &#8220;Now then,
take hold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">In a few minutes the cloth was spread
upon the table and the best dishes brought from a
closet built into the kitchen wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many plates?&#8221; asked Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, let&#8217;s count once.
Eleven of us and Isabel makes twelve and--won&#8217;t
you stay, too, Amanda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I&#8217;d make thirteen,&#8221; she
said, laughing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I don&#8217;t believe
in that unlucky business. You can just as well stay
and have a good time with us. You know Isabel.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I know her. But really,
I can&#8217;t stay. I must get home early. Some other
time I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then, but I&#8217;d like it if you
could be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put twelve plates on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What I don&#8217;t know about
is the napkins, Amanda. We used to roll them up and
put them in the tumblers and then some people folded
them in triangles and laid them on the plates, but
I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s right now. Mine
are just folded square.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ll
place them to the side, so. And the forks go here
and the knives and spoons to this side.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t it beat all?
They lay the spoons on the table now? What for is
the spoon-holder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone out of style.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s funny. I
guess when our Mary gets a little older once, she&#8217;ll
want to fix things up, too. I don&#8217;t care if she
does, so long as she don&#8217;t want to do dumb things
and put on a lot of airs that ain&#8217;t fittin&#8217;
to plain people like us. But it&#8217;ll be a big wonder
to me if one of the children won&#8217;t say something
about the spoons bein&#8217; on the table-cloth. That&#8217;s
new to them. Then I need three glass dishes for jelly
so none will have to reach so far for it. And a big
platter for fried ham, a pitcher for the gravy, a
dish for smashed potatoes, one for sweet potatoes,
a glass one for cabbage slaw and I guess I ought to
put desserts out for the slaw, Amanda. I hate when
gravy and everything gets mixed on the plate. Then
I&#8217;m going to have some new peas and sour red
beets and the short cake. I guess that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It sounds like real Lancaster
County food,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Your company
should enjoy her supper.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I guess she will. Now
I must call in some of the children and get them started
dressin&#8217; once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She stood at the screen door of the
kitchen and rang a small hand bell. Its tintinnabulation
sounded through the yard and reached the ears of the
children who were playing there. The three boys next
in age to Martin were helping their father in the
fields, but the other children came running at the
sound of the bell.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Time to get dressed,&#8221;
announced Mrs. Landis. &#8220;You all stay round here
now so I can call you easy as one gets done washin&#8217;.
Johnny, you take Charlie and the two of you get washed
and put on the clothes I laid on your bed. Then you
stay on the porch so you don&#8217;t get dirty again
till supper and the company comes. Be sure to wash
your feet and legs right before you put on your stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Aw, stockings!&#8221; growled
Charlie. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we stay barefooty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For company?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; he said sulkily
as he walked to the stairs, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
the kind of company you got to put stockings on for!
Not on week-days, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">His mother laughed. &#8220;Emma,&#8221;
she addressed one of the girls, &#8220;when the boys
come back you and Mary and Katie must get washed and
dressed for the company. Mary, you dare wear your
blue hair-ribbons today and the girls can put their
pink ones on and their white dresses.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the little girls
cried happily. Dressing up for company held more pleasure
for them than it did for the boys.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I laugh still,&#8221; said
Mrs. Landis, &#8220;when people say what a lot of work
so many children make. In many ways, like sewing and
cookin&#8217; for them they do, but in other ways
they are a big help to me and to each other. If I
had just one now I&#8217;d have to dress it, but with
so many they help the littler ones and all I got to
do is tell them what to do. It don&#8217;t hurt them
to work a little. Mary is big enough now to put a big
apron on and help me with gettin&#8217; meals ready.
And the boys are good about helpin&#8217; me, too.
Why, Martin, now, he used to help me like a girl when
the babies were little and I had a lot to do. Mister
said the other day we dare be glad our boys ain&#8217;t
give us no trouble so far. But this girl of Martin&#8217;s,
now, she kinda worries me. I said to Mister if only
he&#8217;d pick out a girl like you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">To her surprise the face of the girl
blanched. Mrs. Landis thought in dismay, &#8220;Now
what for dumb block am I, not to guess that mebbe Amanda
likes our Martin! Ach, my! but it spites me that he&#8217;s
gone on that city girl! Well,&#8221; she went on,
talking in an effort at reparation and in seeming
ignorance of the secret upon which she had stumbled,
&#8220;mebbe he ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to marry her
after all. These boys sometimes run after such bright,
merry butterfly girls and then they get tired of them
and pick out a nice sensible one to marry. Abody must
just keep on hopin&#8217; that everything will turn
out right. Anyhow, I don&#8217;t let myself worry much
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do you ever worry, Mrs. Landis?
I can&#8217;t remember ever seeing you worried and
borrowing trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No, what&#8217;s the use? I
found out long ago that worry don&#8217;t get you
nowhere except in hot water, so what&#8217;s the use
of it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s a good way to
look at things if you can do it,&#8221; the girl agreed.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go home now. You don&#8217;t
need me. You&#8217;ll get along nicely, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yes, I guess so. But now
you must come soon again, Amanda. This company business
kinda spoiled your visit to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda was in the rear of the house
and did not see the vision of loveliness which passed
the Reist farmhouse about five o&#8217;clock that
afternoon. One of Martin&#8217;s brothers met the two
at the trolley and drove them to the Landis farm.
Isabel Souders was that day, indeed, attractive. She
wore a corn-colored organdie dress and leghorn hat,
her natural beauty was enhanced by a becoming coiffure,
her eyes danced, her lips curved in their most bewitching
bow.</p>

<p align="left">The visitor was effusive in her meeting
with Martin&#8217;s mother. &#8220;Dear Mrs. Landis,&#8221;
she gushed, &#8220;it is so lovely of you to have me
here! Last summer while I boarded at Reists&#8217;
I was so sorry not to meet you! Of course I met Martin
and some of the younger children but the mother is
always the most adorable one of the family! Oh, come
here, dear, you darling,&#8221; she cooed to little
Emma, who had tiptoed into the room. But Emma held
to her mother&#8217;s apron and refused to move.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Emma,&#8221; Katie, a
little older, chided her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll run a
mile to Amanda Reist if you see her. Don&#8217;t act
so simple! Talk to the lady; she&#8217;s our company.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, she&#8217;s bashful all
of a sudden,&#8221; said Mrs. Landis, smiling. &#8220;Now,
Miss Souders, you take your hat off and just make yourself
at home while I finish gettin&#8217; the supper ready.
You dare look through them albums in the front room
or set on the front porch. Just make yourself at home
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, how lovely!&#8221; came the sweet
reply.</p>

<p align="left">A little while later when Martin left
her and went to his room to prepare for the evening
meal the children, too, scurried away one by one and
left Isabel alone. She took swift inventory of the
furnishings of the front room.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Dear,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;what
atrocious taste! How can Martin live here? How can
he belong to a family like this?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But later she was all smiles again
as Martin joined her and Mrs. Landis brought her husband
into the room to meet the guest. Mr. Landis had, in
spite of protests and murmurings, been persuaded to
hearken to the advice of his wife and wear a coat.
Likewise the older boys had followed Martin&#8217;s
example and donned the hot woolen articles of dress
they considered superfluous in the house during the
summer days.</p>

<p align="left">Isabel chattered gaily to the men
of the Landis household until Mrs. Landis stood in
the doorway and announced, &#8220;Come now, folks,
supper&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After the twelve were seated about
the big table, Mr. Landis said grace and then Mrs.
Landis rose to pour the coffee, several of the boys
started to pass the platters and dishes around the
table and the evening meal on the farm was in full
swing.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; piped out little
Charlie as he lifted his plate for a slice of ham,
&#8220;somebody&#8217;s went and threw all the spoons
on the table-cloth! Here&#8217;s two by my plate.
And Emma&#8217;s got some by her place, too!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Sh!&#8221; warned Mary, but
Mrs. Landis laughed heartily. &#8220;Easy seeing,&#8221;
she confessed, &#8220;that we ain&#8217;t used to
puttin&#8217; on style. Charlie, that&#8217;s the
latest way of puttin&#8217; spoons on. Amanda Reist
did it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda Reist,&#8221; said Mr.
Landis. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t she stay for supper
if she was here when you set the table?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked her to but she couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the guest said,
&#8220;I think Amanda is the sweetest girl. I just
love her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; added Mary. &#8220;She&#8217;s
my teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine too,&#8221; said Katie. &#8220;I like
her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The Landis children were taught politeness
according to the standards of their parents, but they
had never been told that they should be seen and not
heard. Meal-time at the Landis farm was not a quiet
time. The children were encouraged to repeat any interesting
happening of the day and there was much laughter and
genial conversation and frank expressions about the
taste of the food.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um, ain&#8217;t that short cake good!&#8221;
said Charlie, smacking his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delicious, lovely!&#8221; agreed the guest.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here, have another piece,&#8221;
urged Mrs. Landis. &#8220;I always make enough for
two times around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom takes care of us, all right,&#8221; testified
Mr. Landis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovely, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Isabel said
with a bright smile.</p>

<p align="left">And so the dinner hour sped and at
length all rose and Martin, tagged by two of the younger
boys, showed Isabel the garden and yard, while Mrs.
Landis with the aid of Mary and one of the boys cleared
off and washed the dishes. Then the entire family
gathered on the big porch and the time passed so quickly
in the soft June night that the guest declared it
had seemed like a mere minute.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This is the most lovely, adorable
family,&#8221; she told them. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
a wonderful time. How I hate to go back to the noisy
city! How I envy you this lovely porch on such nights!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Later, when Martin returned from seeing
the visitor back to Lancaster, his parents were sitting
alone on the porch.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, Mother, Dad, what do
you think of her?&#8221; he asked in his boyish eagerness
to have their opinion of the girl he thought he was
beginning to care for. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t she nice?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Seems like a very nice girl,&#8221;
said his mother with measured enthusiasm.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; was the
boy&#8217;s impatient answer, &#8220;of course you
wouldn&#8217;t think any girl was good enough for
your boy! I can see that. If an angel from heaven
came down after me you&#8217;d find flaws in her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Easy, Mart,&#8221; cautioned
the father. &#8220;Better put on the brakes a bit.
Your mom and I think about the same, I guess, that
the girl&#8217;s a likely enough lady and she surely
is easy to look at, but she ain&#8217;t what we&#8217;d
pick out for you if we had the say. It&#8217;s like
some of these here fancy ridin&#8217; horses people
buy. They&#8217;re all right for ridin&#8217; but no
good for hitchin&#8217; to a plow. You don&#8217;t
just want a wife that you can play around with and
dress pretty and amuse yourself with. You need a wife
that&#8217;ll work with you and be a partner and not
fail you when trouble comes. Think that over, Mart.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Gosh, you talk as though I
had asked her to marry me. We are just good friends.
I enjoy visiting her and hearing her play.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, Martin, I know, but life
ain&#8217;t all piano playin&#8217; after you get
married, is it, Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Landis laughed. &#8220;No, it&#8217;s
often other kinds of music! But I&#8217;m not sorry
I&#8217;m married.&#8221; &#8220;Me neither,&#8221;
confirmed her husband. &#8220;And that, Mart, is what
you want to watch for when you pick a wife. Pick one
so that after you been livin&#8217; together thirty
years you can both say you&#8217;re not sorry you
married. That&#8217;s the test!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, some test!&#8221; the boy
said drearily. &#8220;I--I guess you&#8217;re right,
both of you. I guess it isn&#8217;t a thing to rush
into. But you don&#8217;t know Isabel. She&#8217;s
really a lovely, sweet girl.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Of course she is,&#8221; said
his mother. &#8220;You just hold on to her and go
see her as often as you like. Perhaps when you&#8217;ve
been at the bank a while longer and can afford to
get married you&#8217;ll find she&#8217;s the very
one you want. Any one you pick we&#8217;ll like.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, of course, yes,&#8221;
said Mr. Landis. Wise parents! They knew that direct
opposition to the choice of the son would frustrate
their hopes for him. Let him go on seeing the butterfly
and perhaps the sooner he&#8217;d outgrow her charms,
they thought.</p>

<p align="left">But later, as Mr. Landis unlaced his
shoes and his wife took off her white Mennonite cap
and combed her hair for the night, that mild man sputtered
and stormed. All the gentle acquiescence was fallen
from him. &#8220;That empty-headed doll has got our
Mart just wrapped round her finger! All she can say
is &#8216;Delicious, lovely, darling!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Landis laughed at his imitation
of the affected Isabel.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good guns, Mom, if any of our
boys tie up with a doll like that it&#8217;ll break
our hearts. Why couldn&#8217;t Mart pick a sensible
girl that can cook and ain&#8217;t too tony nor lazy
to do it? A girl like Amanda Reist, now, would be
more suited to him. Poor Mart, he&#8217;s bamboozled
if he gets this one! But if we told him that he&#8217;d
be so mad he&#8217;d run to-morrow and marry her.
We got to be a little careful, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yes, he&#8217;ll get over
it. He&#8217;s a whole lot like you and I don&#8217;t
believe he&#8217;d marry a girl like that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hope he shows
as good taste when he picks a wife as I did, ain&#8217;t,
Mom?&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch16"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVI</h1>

<h2 align="center">Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s Will</h2>

<p align="left">That summer Aunt Rebecca became ill.
Millie volunteered to take care of her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She ain&#8217;t got no child
to do for her,&#8221; said the hired girl, &#8220;and
abody feels forlorn when you&#8217;re sick. I&#8217;ll
go tend her if you want.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Millie, I&#8217;d be so
glad if you&#8217;d go! Strangers might be ugly to
her, for she&#8217;s a little hard to get along with.
And I can&#8217;t do it to take care of her.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You--well, I guess you ain&#8217;t
strong enough to do work like that. If she gets real
sick she&#8217;ll have to be lifted around and she
ain&#8217;t too light, neither. If you and Amanda
can shift here I&#8217;ll just pack my telescope and
go right over to Landisville.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">So Millie packed and strapped her
old gray telescope and went to wait on the sick woman.</p>

<p align="left">She found Aunt Rebecca in bed, very
ill, with a kind neighbor ministering to her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;My goodness, Millie,&#8221;
she greeted the newcomer, &#8220;I never was so glad
to see anybody like I am you! You pay this lady for
her trouble. My money is in the wash-stand drawer.
Lock the drawer open and get it out&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After the neighbor had been paid and
departed Millie and the sick woman were left alone.
&#8220;Millie,&#8221; said Aunt Rebecca, &#8220;you
stay with me till I go. Ach, you needn&#8217;t tell
me I&#8217;ll get well. I know I&#8217;m done for.
I don&#8217;t want a lot o&#8217; strangers pokin&#8217;
round in my things and takin&#8217; care of me. I&#8217;m
crabbit and they don&#8217;t have no patience.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, you&#8217;ll be around
again in no time,&#8221; said Millie cheerfully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you worry. I&#8217;ll run everything just like it ought
to be. I&#8217;ll tend you so good you&#8217;ll be
up and about before you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m not so easy fooled.
I won&#8217;t get out of this room till I&#8217;m carried
out, I know. My goodness, abody thinks back over a
lot o&#8217; things when you get right sick once!
I made a will, Millie, and a pretty good one,&#8221;
the sick woman laughed as if in enjoyment of a pleasant
secret. Her nurse attributed the laughter to delirium.
But Aunt Rebecca went on, astonishing the other woman
more and deepening the conviction that the strange
talk was due to flightiness.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I made a will! Some people&#8217;ll
say I was crazy, but you tell them for me I&#8217;m
as sane as any one. My goodness, can&#8217;t abody
do what abody wants with your own money? Didn&#8217;t
I slave and scratch and skimp like everything all
my life! And you bet I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give
that there money just where I want!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, people always fuss about
wills. It gives them something to talk about,&#8221;
said Millie, thinking argument useless.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, it won&#8217;t worry me.
I won&#8217;t hear it. I have it all fixed where and
how I want to be buried, and all about the funeral.
I want to have a nice funeral, eat in the meeting-house,
and have enough to eat, too. I was to a funeral once
and everything got all before all the people had eaten.
I was close livin&#8217;, but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to be close dead.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now you go to sleep,&#8221;
ordered Millie. &#8220;You can tell me the rest some
other time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">That evening as Millie sat on a low
rocker by the bedside, the dim flare of an oil lamp
flickering on the faces of the two women, Aunt Rebecca
told more of the things she was so eager to detail
while strength lasted.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Jonas always thought that if
I lived longest half of what I have should go back
to the Miller people, his side of the family. But I
tell you, Millie, none of them ever come to see me
except one or two who come just for the money. They
was wishin&#8217; long a&#8217;ready I&#8217;d die
and they&#8217;d get it. But Jonas didn&#8217;t put
that in the will. He left me everything and he did
say once I could do with it what I want. So I made
a will and I&#8217;m givin&#8217; them Millers five
thousand dollars in all and the rest--well, you&#8217;ll
find out what I done with the rest after I&#8217;m
gone. I never had much good out my money and I&#8217;m
havin&#8217; a lot of pleasure lyin&#8217; here and
thinkin&#8217; what some people will do with what I
leave them in my will. I had a lot of good that way
a&#8217;ready since I&#8217;m sick. People will have
something to talk about once when I die.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">And so the sick woman rambled on,
while Millie thought the fever caused the strange
words and paid little attention to their import. But,
several weeks later, when the querulous old woman closed
her eyes in her long, last sleep, Millie, who had
nursed her so faithfully, remembered each detail of
the funeral as Aunt Rebecca had told her and saw to
it that every one was carried out.</p>

<p align="left">According to her wishes, Aunt Rebecca
was robed in white for burial. The cashmere dress
was fashioned, of course, after the garb she had worn
so many years, and was complete with apron, pointed
cape, all in white. Her hair was parted and folded
under a white cap as it had been in her lifetime.
She looked peaceful and happy as she lay in the parlor
of her little home in Landisville. A smile seemed to
have fixed itself about her lips as though the pleasant
thoughts her will had occasioned lingered with her
to the very last.</p>

<p align="left">She had stipulated that short services
be held at the house, then the body taken to the church
and a public service held and after interment in the
old Mennonite graveyard at Landisville, a public dinner
to be served in the basement of the meeting-house,
as is frequently the custom in that community.</p>

<p align="left">The service of the burial of the dead
is considered by the plain sects as a sacred obligation
to attend whenever possible. Relatives, friends, and
members of the deceased&#8217;s religious sect, drive
many miles to pay their last respects to departed
ones. The innate hospitality of the Pennsylvania Dutch
calls for the serving of a light lunch after the funeral.
Relatives, friends, who have come from a distance or
live close by, and all others who wish to partake
of it, are welcomed. Therefore most meeting-houses
of the plain sects have their basements fitted with
long tables and benches, a generous supply of china
and cutlery, a stove big enough for making many quarts
of coffee. And after the burial willing hands prepare
the food and many take advantage of the proffered
hospitality and file to the long tables, where bread,
cheese, cold meat, coffee and sometimes beets and pie,
await them. This was an important portion of what
Aunt Rebecca called a &#8220;nice funeral,&#8221;
and it was given to her.</p>

<p align="left">Later in the day, while the nearest
relatives were still together in the little house
at Landisville, the lawyer arrived and read the will.</p>

<p align="left">The Millers, who were so eager for
their legacies, were impatient with all the legal
phrasing, &#8220;Being of sound mind&#8221; and so
forth. They sat up more attentively when the lawyer
read, &#8220;do hereby bequeath.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">First came the wish that all real
estate be sold, that personal property be given to
her sister, the sum of five hundred dollars be given
to the Mennonite Church at Landisville for the upkeep
of the burial ground. Then the announcement of the
sum of five thousand dollars to be equally divided
among the heirs of Jonas Miller, deceased, the sum
of five thousand dollars to her brother Amos Rohrer,
a like amount to her sister, Mrs. Reist, the sum of
ten thousand dollars to Martin Landis, husband of
Elizabeth Anders, and the remainder, if any, to be
divided equally between said brother Amos and sister
Mary.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin Landis!&#8221; exploded
one of the Miller women, &#8220;who under the sun
is he? To get ten thousand dollars of Rebecca&#8217;s
money!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221;
spoke up Uncle Amos, &#8220;he&#8217;s an old beau
of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, who ever heard of such
a thing! And here we are, her own blood, you might
say, close relations of poor Jonas, and we get only
five thousand to be divided into about twenty shares!
It&#8217;s an outrage! Such a will ought to be broken!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; came Uncle
Amos&#8217;s firm reply. &#8220;It was all Rebecca&#8217;s
money and hers to do with what suited her. She&#8217;s
made me think a whole lot more of her by this here
will. I&#8217;m glad to know she didn&#8217;t forget
her old beau. She was a little prickly on the outside
sometimes, but I guess her heart was soft after all.
It&#8217;s all right, it&#8217;s all right, that will
is! It ain&#8217;t for us to fuss about. She could
have give the whole lot of it to some cat home or
spent it while she lived. It was <i>hers</i>! If that&#8217;s
all, lawyer, I guess we&#8217;ll go. Mary and I are
satisfied and the rest got to be. I bet Rebecca got
a lot o&#8217; good thinkin&#8217; how Martin Landis
would get the surprise of his life when she was in
her grave.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">In a short time the news spread over
the rural community that Rebecca Miller willed Martin
Landis ten thousand dollars! Some said facetiously
that it might be a posthumous thank-offering for what
she missed when she refused to marry him. Others,
keen for romance, repeated a sentimental story about
a broken heart and a lifelong sorrow because of her
foolish inability to see what was best for her and
how at the close of her life she conceived the beautiful
thought of leaving him the money so that he might
know she had never forgotten him and so that he might
remember his old sweetheart. But in whatever form the
incident was presented it never failed to evoke interest.
&#8220;Ten thousand dollars from an old girl! What
luck!&#8221; exclaimed many.</p>

<p align="left">If persons not directly concerned
in the ten thousand dollar legacy were surprised what
word can adequately describe the emotion of Martin
Landis when Amanda&#8217;s verbal report of it was
duly confirmed by a legal notice from the lawyer!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good guns, Mom!&#8221; the
man said in astonishment. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make
it out! I can&#8217;t get head nor tail out the thing.
What ailed Becky, anyhow? To do a thing like that!
I feel kinda mean takin&#8217; so much money. It ought
to go to Amos and Mary. They got five thousand apiece
and somebody said the farms will bring more than Becky
thought and by the time they are sold and everything
divided Amos and Mary will get about eleven thousand
each. It&#8217;s right for them to get it, but it don&#8217;t
seem right for me to have it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But Millie soon paid a visit to the
Landis home and repeated many of the things Aunt Rebecca
had told her those last evenings by the light of the
little oil lamp. &#8220;She said, Mr. Landis, that
one day she was lookin&#8217; at the big Bible and
come across an old valentine you sent her when you
and she was young. It said on it, &#8217;If I had the
world I&#8217;d give you half of it.&#8217; And that
set her thinkin&#8217; what a nice surprise she could
fix up if she&#8217;d will you some of her money. And
she said, too, that Jonas was a good man but it worried
her that she broke off with a poor man to marry a
rich one when she liked the poor one best. I guess
all that made her so queer and crabbit. She never let
on when she was well that she wished she&#8217;d married
you but when she come to die she didn&#8217;t care
much if it was found out. You just take that there
money and enjoy it; that&#8217;s what Rebecca wanted
you should do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I guess she wanted me
to have it,&#8221; the man said thoughtfully. &#8220;But
it beats me why she did it. Why, I&#8217;d almost forgot
that I ever kept company with her and was promised
to marry her. It&#8217;s so long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Men do forget,&#8221; said
Millie. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s the women that remember.
But the money&#8217;s for you, that&#8217;s her will,
and she said I should be sure to see that the will
is carried out and that the money goes where she said.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes--we can use it. We&#8217;ll
be glad for it. I wish I could say thanks to Becky
for it. It don&#8217;t seem right by Amos and Mary,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, they don&#8217;t need
it. They got lots a&#8217;ready. The only ones that
begrudge it are the relations of Jonas. None of them
come to shake up a pillow for poor Rebecca or bring
her an orange or get her a drink of water, but they
come when the will was read. I just like to see such
people get fooled! They wanted a lot and got a little
and you didn&#8217;t expect nothin&#8217; and look
what you got! There&#8217;s some nice surprises in
the world, for all, ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVII</h1>

<h2 align="center">Martin&#8217;s Dark Hour</h2>

<p align="left">That summer Martin Landis was well
pleased with the world in general. He enjoyed his
work at the bank, where his cordiality and adeptness,
his alert, receptive mind, were laying for him a strong
foundation for a successful career.</p>

<p align="left">He called often at the home of Isabel
Souders, listened to her playing, made one in an occasional
game of cards, escorted her to musicals and dramas.
He played and talked and laughed with her, but he soon
discovered that he could not interest her in any serious
matter. At the mention of his work, beyond the merest
superficialities, she lifted her hands and said in
laughing tones, &#8220;Please, Martin, don&#8217;t
talk shop! Father never does. I&#8217;m like Mother,
I don&#8217;t want to hear the petty details of money-making--all
that interests me is the money itself. Dad says I&#8217;m
spoiled--I suppose I am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">At such times the troublesome memory
of his father&#8217;s words came to him, &#8220;You
need a wife that will work with you and be a partner
and not fail you when trouble comes.&#8221; Try as
he would the young man could not obliterate those
haunting words from his brain. Sometimes he felt almost
convinced in his own heart that he loved Isabel Souders--she
was so appealing and charming and, while she rebuffed
his confidences about his work, nevertheless showed
so deep an interest in him generally, that he was
temporarily blinded by it and excused her lack of real
interest on the world-old ground that pretty women
are not supposed to bother about prosaic affairs of
the male wage-earners of the race.</p>

<p align="left">There were moments when her beauty
so thrilled him that he felt moved to tell her he
loved her and wanted to marry her, but somewhere in
the subconscious mind of him must have dwelt the succinct
words of the poster, &#8220;When in doubt, <i>don&#8217;t!</i>&#8221;
So the moments of fascination passed and the words
of love were left unsaid.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Some day,&#8221; he thought,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll know, I&#8217;ll be sure. It will
probably come to me like a flash of lightning whether
I love her or not. I shouldn&#8217;t be so undecided.
I think if it were the real thing I feel for her there
would be not the shadow of a doubt in my heart concerning
it. A man should feel that the woman he wants to marry
is the only one in the universe for him. Somehow,
I can&#8217;t feel that about her. But there&#8217;s
no hurry about marrying. We&#8217;ll just go on being
capital friends. Meanwhile I can be saving money so
that if the time comes when I marry I&#8217;ll be
able to support a wife. Things look pretty rosy for
me at present. Since Father is fixed with that legacy
and the boys are old enough to take my place on the
farm I have time to study and advance. I&#8217;m in
luck all around; guess I got a horseshoe round my
neck!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But the emblem of good luck must have
soon lost its potency. The bank force was surprised
one day by an unexpected examination of the books.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;
asked Martin of another worker in the bank.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Ask old
Buehlor. He acts as though he knew.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin approached the gray-haired
president, who was stamping about his place like an
angry dog on leash. &#8220;Anything the matter, sir?
Can I help in any way?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, yes, there seems to be,&#8221;
he snapped. &#8220;Come in, Landis.&#8221; He opened
the door of his private office and Martin followed
him inside. He gave one long look into the face of
the young man--"I&#8217;m going to tell you. Perhaps
you can make things easier for us to adjust in case
there&#8217;s anything wrong. An investigation has
been ordered. One of our heaviest depositors seems
to have some inside information that some one is spending
the bank&#8217;s money for personal use.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good guns! In this bank? A
thief?&#8221; Horror was printed on the face of Martin.</p>

<p align="left">The man opposite searched that face.
&#8220;Yes--I might as well tell you--I feel like
a brute to do so--if it&#8217;s false it&#8217;s a
damnable trick, for such a thing is a fiendish calumny
for an honest man to bear--you&#8217;re the man under
suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin sat up, his eyes wide in horror,
then his chest collapsed and his neck felt limber.
&#8220;Oh, my God,&#8221; he whispered, as though in
appeal to the Infinite Father of Mercy and Justice,
&#8220;what a thing to say about me! What a lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie?&#8221; asked the older man
tersely.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Absolutely! I&#8217;ve never
stolen anything since the days I wore short pants
and climbed the neighbors&#8217; trees for apples.
Who says it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t divulge that now. Perhaps
later.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin groaned. To be branded a thief
was more than he could bear. His face went whiter.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;See here,&#8221; said the old
man, &#8220;I almost shocked you to death, but I had
a purpose in it. I couldn&#8217;t believe that of you
and knew I&#8217;d be able to read your face. You
know, I believe you! It&#8217;s all some infernal mistake
or plot. You&#8217;re not a clever enough actor to
feign such distress and innocence. Go out and get
some air and come back to-morrow morning. I&#8217;ll
stand for you in the meantime. I believe in you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; Martin
managed to blurt out between dry lips that seemed
almost paralyzed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in the
morning. Hope you&#8217;ll find I&#8217;m telling
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He walked as a somnambulist down the
street. In his misery he thought of Isabel Souders.
He would go to her for comfort. She&#8217;d understand
and believe in him! He yearned like a hurt child for
the love and tenderness of some one who could comfort
him and sweep the demons of distress from his soul.
He wanted to see Isabel, only Isabel! He felt relieved
that no older member of the household was at home at
that time, that the colored servant who answered his
ring at the bell said Isabel was alone and would see
him at once.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;
the girl asked as she entered the room where he waited
for her. &#8220;You look half dead!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I am, Isabel,&#8221; he said
chokingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a death-blow. They
are accusing me of stealing the bank&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Martin! Oh, how dreadful!
I&#8217;ll never forgive you!&#8221; The girl spoke
in tearful voice. &#8220;How perfectly dreadful to
have such a thing said after Father got you into the
bank! Your reputation is ruined for life! You can
never live down such a disgrace.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t do it!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;You must know I couldn&#8217;t have
done it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I suppose you didn&#8217;t
if you say so, but people always are ready to say
that where there&#8217;s smoke there must be some fire!
Oh, dear, people know you&#8217;re a friend of mine
and next thing the papers will link our names in the
notoriety and--oh, what a dreadful thing to happen!
They&#8217;ll print horrible things about you and may
drag me into it, too! Say you spent the money on me,
or something like that! Father will be so mortified
and sorry he helped you. Oh, dear, I think it&#8217;s
dreadful, dreadful!&#8221; She burst into weeping.</p>

<p align="left">As Martin watched her and listened
to her utterly selfish words, in spite of the misery
in his heart, he was keenly conscious that she was
being weighed in the balance and found wanting. The
lightning flash had come to him and revealed how impotent
she was, how shallow and selfish.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t cry about
it,&#8221; he said, half bitterly, yet too crushed
to be aught but gentle. &#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt
you. I&#8217;ll see to that. If there&#8217;s anything
to bear I&#8217;ll bear it alone. My shoulders are
broad.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">There was more futile exchange of
words, words that lacked any comfort or hope for the
broken-hearted man. Martin soon left and started for
his home.</p>

<p align="left">Home--he couldn&#8217;t go there and
tell his people that he was suspected of a crime.
Home--its old sweet meaning would be changed for all
of them if one of its flock was blackened.</p>

<p align="left">He flurried past the Reist farmhouse,
head down like a criminal so that none should recognize
him. With quick steps that almost merged into a run
he went up the road. When he reached the little Crow
Hill schoolhouse a sudden thought came to him. He
climbed the rail fence and entered the woods, plodded
up the hill to the spot where Amanda&#8217;s moccasins
grew each spring. There he threw himself on the grassy
slope, face down, and gave vent to his despair.</p>

<a name="ch18"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVIII</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Comforter</h2>

<p align="left">Amanda Reist knew the woods so well
that she never felt any fear as she wandered about
in them. That August morning as she climbed the fence
by the school-yard and sauntered along the narrow
paths between the trees she hummed a little song--not
because of any particular happiness, but because the
sky was blue and the woods were green and she loved
to be outdoors.</p>

<p align="left">She climbed the narrow trail, gathering
early goldenrod, which she suddenly dropped, and stood
still. Before her, a distance of about twenty feet,
lay the figure of a man, face down on the ground, his
arms flung out, his hair disheveled. A great fear
rose in her heart. Was it a tramp, an intoxicated
wanderer, was he dead? She shrank from the sight and
took a few backward steps, feeling a strong impulse
to run, yet held riveted to the spot by some inexplicable,
irresistible force.</p>

<p align="left">The figure moved slightly--why, it
looked like Martin Landis! But he wouldn&#8217;t be
lying so in the grass at that time of day! The face
of the man was suddenly turned to her and a cry came
from her lips--it <i>was</i> Martin Landis! But what
a Martin Landis! Haggard and lined, his face looked
like the face of a debilitated old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; she called, anxiously. &#8220;Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He raised his head and leaned on his
elbow. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he groaned, then turned his
head away.</p>

<p align="left">She ran to him then and knelt beside
him in the grass. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Martin?&#8221;
she asked, all the love in her heart rushing to meet
the need of her &#8220;knight.&#8221; &#8220;Tell
me what&#8217;s the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say I&#8217;m a thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221; she demanded, a Xantippe-like
flash in her eyes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;The bank, they&#8217;re examining
the books, swooped down like a lot of vultures and
hunting for carrion right now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake! Martin!
Sit up and tell me about it! Don&#8217;t cover your
face as though you <i>were</i> a thief! Of course there&#8217;s
some mistake, there must be! Get up, tell me. Let&#8217;s
sit over on that old log and get it straightened out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Spurred by her words he raised himself
and she mechanically brushed the dry leaves from his
coat as they walked to a fallen log and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell me,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;the whole
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haltingly he told the tale, though the process hurt.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And you ran away,&#8221; she
exclaimed when he had finished. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t
wait to see what the books revealed? You ran right
out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes--no, I stopped at Isabel&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh"--Amanda closed her eyes
a moment--it had been Isabel first again! She quickly
composed herself to hear what the city girl had done
in the man&#8217;s hour of trial. &#8220;Isabel didn&#8217;t
believe it, of course?&#8221; she asked quietly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No, I suppose she didn&#8217;t.
But she cried and fussed and said my reputation was
ruined for life and even if my innocence is proved
I can never wholly live down such a reputation. She
was worried because the thing may come out in the
papers and her name brought into it. She&#8217;s mighty
much upset about Isabel Souders, didn&#8217;t care
a picayune about Martin Landis.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She&#8217;ll get over it,&#8221;
Amanda told him, a lighter feeling in her heart. &#8220;What
we are concerned about now is Martin Landis. You should
have stayed and seen it through, faced them and demanded
the lie to be traced to its source. Why, Martin, cheer
up, this can&#8217;t harm you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My reputation,&#8221; he said gloomily.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, your reputation is what
people think you are, but your character is what you
really are. A noble character can often change a very
questionable reputation. You know you are honest as
the day is long--we are all sure of that, all who
know you. Martin, nothing can hurt <i>you!</i> People
can make you unhappy by such lies and cause the road
to be a little harder to travel but no one except yourself
can ever touch <i>you!</i> Your character is impregnable.
Brace up! Go back and tell them it&#8217;s a lie and
then prove it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda"--the man&#8217;s voice
quavered. &#8220;Amanda, you&#8217;re an angel! You
make me buck up. When you found me I felt as though
a load of bricks were thrown on my heart, but I&#8217;m
beginning to see a glimmer of light. Of course, I
can prove I&#8217;m innocent!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Listen, look!&#8221; Amanda
whispered. She laid a hand upon his arm while she
pointed with the other to a tree near by.</p>

<p align="left">There sat an indigo bunting, that
tiny bird of blue so intense that the very skies look
pale beside it and among all the blue flowers of our
land only the fringed gentian can rival it. With no
attempt to hide his gorgeous self he perched in full
view on a branch of the tree and began to sing in
rapid notes. What the song lacked in sweetness was
quite forgotten as they looked at the lovely visitant.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;There&#8217;s your blue bunting
of hope,&#8221; said Amanda as the bird suddenly became
silent as though he were out of breath or too tired
to finish the melody.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221;
said Martin, a light of hope once more in his eyes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, he is wonderful, not only
because of his fine color but because he&#8217;s the
one bird that sultry August weather can&#8217;t still.
When all others are silent he sings, halts a while,
then sings again. That is why I said he is your blue
bunting of hope. Isn&#8217;t it like that with us?
When other feelings are gone hope stays with us, never
quite deserts us--hear him!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">True to his reputation the indigo
bird burst once more into song, then off he flew,
still singing his clear, rapid notes.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda,&#8221; the man said
as the blue wings carried the bird out of sight, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
helped me--I can&#8217;t tell you how much! I&#8217;m
going back to the bank and face that lie. If I could
only find out who started it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;d
like to bet Mr. Mertzheimer is back of it, somehow.
The old man is a heavy depositor there, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, but why under the sun
would he say such a thing about me? I never liked
Lyman and he had no love for me, but he has no cause
to bear me ill will. I haven&#8217;t anything he wants,
I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; The girl bit her lip and felt her
cheeks burn.</p>

<p align="left">Martin looked at her, amazed. Why
was she blushing? Surely, she didn&#8217;t like Lyman
Mertzheimer!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Martin,&#8221; she was
thinking, &#8220;how blind you are! You do have something
Lyman Mertzheimer wants. I can see through it all.
He thinks with you disgraced I&#8217;ll have eyes
for him at last. The cheat! The cheat!&#8221; she
said out loud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Martin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;He&#8217;s a cheat, Lyman is.
I hope he gets what&#8217;s coming to him some day
and I get a chance to see it! You see if that precious
father of his is not at the bottom of all this worry
for you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It may be. I&#8217;m going
in to Lancaster and find out. If he is, and if I ever
get my hands on him---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good-bye Lyman!&#8221; said
Amanda, laughing. &#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t want
to touch anything as low as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to have the chance; I&#8217;d
pound him to jelly.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, no, you wouldn&#8217;t.
You&#8217;d just look at him and he&#8217;d shrivel
till he&#8217;d look like a dried crabapple snitz!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Both laughed at the girl&#8217;s words.
A moment later they rose from the old log and walked
down the path. When they had climbed the fence and
stood in the hot, sunny road Martin said, &#8220;I
guess I&#8217;ll go home and get cleaned up.&#8221;
He rubbed a hand through his tumbled hair.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And get something to eat,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;By that time you&#8217;ll be ready,
like Luther, to face a horde of devils.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Thanks to you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget this half-hour just
gone. Your blue bunting of hope will be singing in
my heart whenever things go wrong. You said a few
things to me that I couldn&#8217;t forget if I wanted
to--for instance, that nothing, nobody, can hurt <i>me</i>,
except myself. That&#8217;s something to keep in mind.
I feel equal to fight now, fight for my reputation.
Some kind providence must have sent you up the hill
to find me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; she said depreciatively,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do a thing but steady you up
a bit. I&#8217;m glad I happened to come up and see
you. Go tell them if they&#8217;re hunting for a thief
they&#8217;re looking in the wrong direction when
they look at Martin Landis! Hurry! So you can get back
before they think you&#8217;ve run away. I&#8217;ll
be so anxious to hear how much the Mertzheimers have
to do with this. I can see their name written all
over it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Smiling, almost happy again, the man
turned down the road to his home and Amanda went on
to the Reist farmhouse. She, too, was smiling as she
went. She had read between the lines of the man&#8217;s
story and had seen there the moving finger writing
above the name of Isabel Souders, &#8220;<i>Mene,
Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</i>.&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch19"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIX</h1>

<h2 align="center">Vindication</h2>

<p align="left">When Martin Landis entered the bank
early in the afternoon of that same day he presented
a different appearance from that of his departure in
the morning. His head was held erect, his step determined,
as he opened the swinging door of the bank and entered.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What--Landis, you back?&#8221;
Mr. Buehlor greeted him, while the quizzical eyes
of the old man looked into those of the younger.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m back and I&#8217;m
back to get this hideous riddle solved and the slate
washed clean.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come in, come in!&#8221; Mr.
Buehlor drew him into a little room and closed the
door. &#8220;Sit down, Landis.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, how much is the bank
short?&#8221; He looked straight into the eyes of
the man who, several hours before, had dealt him such
a death-blow.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So far everything is right,
right as rain! There&#8217;s a mistake or a damnable
dirty trick somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Let&#8217;s sift it out, Mr.
Buehlor. Will you tell me who had the &#8217;inside
information&#8217; that I was taking bank&#8217;s money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you! It was a farmer near your
home---&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mertzheimer?&#8221; offered Martin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;The same! He asked to have
you watched, then changed it and insisted on having
the books examined. Said your people are poor--forgive
me, Landis, but I have to tell you the whole story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind that. That&#8217;s a mere
scratch after what I got this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, he said your father had
a mortgage on his farm up to the time you came to
work in the bank, then suddenly it was paid and soon
after the house was painted, a new bathroom installed,
electric lights put into the house and steam heat,
a Victrola and an automobile bought. In fact, your
people launched out as though they had found a gold
mine, and that in spite of the fact that your crop
of tobacco was ruined by hail and the other income
from the farm products barely enough to keep things
going until another harvest. He naturally thought you
must have a hand in supplying the money and with your
moderate salary you couldn&#8217;t do half of that.
He talked with several of the bank directors and an
investigation was ordered. You&#8217;ll admit his story
sounded plausible. It looked pretty black for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;To you, yes! But not to him!
Mr. Mertzheimer knows well enough where that money
came from. My father had a legacy of ten thousand dollars
this spring. You people could have found that out with
very little trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;We&#8217;re a pack of asinine
blunderers, Landis!&#8221; Mr. Buehlor looked foolish.
Then he sighed relievedly. &#8220;That clears matters
for you. I&#8217;m glad. I couldn&#8217;t conceive
of you as anything but honest, Landis. But tell me
about that legacy--a pretty nice sum.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s a romantic little
story. An old sweetheart of my father, one who must
have carried under her prickly exterior a bit of tender
romance and who liked to do things other people never
dreamed of doing, left him ten thousand dollars. She
was a queer old body. Had no direct heirs, so she
left Father ten thousand dollars for a little remembrance!
It was that honest money that paid for the conveniences
in our house, the second-hand car Father bought and
the Victrola he gave Mother because we are all crazy
for music and had nothing to create any melody except
an old parlor organ that sounded wheezy after nine
babies had played on it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Landis, forgive me; we&#8217;re
a set of fools!&#8221; The old man extended his hand
and looked humbly into the face of Martin. The two
gripped hands, each feeling emotion too great for
words.</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s silence Mr. Buehlor spoke.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This goes no farther. Your
reputation is as safe as mine. If I have anything
to say you&#8217;ll be eligible for the first vacancy
in the line of advancement. As for that Mertzheimer,
he can withdraw his account from our bank to-day for
all we care. We can do business without him. But it
puzzles me--what object did he have? If he knew of
the legacy, and he certainly did, he must have known
you were O.K. Is he an enemy of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not particularly. I never liked
his son but we never had any real tilts.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You don&#8217;t happen to want
the same girl he wants, or anything like that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No--well now--why, I don&#8217;t
know!&#8221; A sudden revelation came to Martin. Perhaps
Lyman thought he had a rival in him. That would explain
much. &#8220;There&#8217;s a son, as I said, and we
know a girl I think he&#8217;s been crazy about for
years. Perhaps he thinks I&#8217;m after her, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see,&#8221; chuckled the
old man. &#8220;Well, if the girl&#8217;s the right
sort she won&#8217;t have to toss a penny to decide
which one to choose.&#8221; He noted the embarrassment
of Martin and changed the subject.</p>

<p align="left">But later in the afternoon as Martin
walked down the road from the trolley and drew near
the Reist farmhouse the old man&#8217;s words recurred
to him. Why, he&#8217;d known Amanda Reist all his
life! He had never dreamed she could comfort and help
a man as she had done that morning in the woods. Amanda
was a fine girl, a great pal, a woman with a heart.</p>

<p align="left">Now Isabel--a great disgust rose in
him for the sniveling, selfish little thing and her
impotence in the face of his trouble. &#8220;She&#8217;s
just the kind to play with,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;just
a doll, and like the doll, has as much heart as a
thing stuffed with sawdust can have. I guess it took
this jolt to wake me up and know that Isabel Souders
is not the type of girl for me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When he reached the Reist home he
found Amanda and her Uncle Amos on the porch.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right!&#8221;
the girl cried as he came into the yard. &#8220;I can
read it in your face.&#8221; Gladness rang in her voice
like a bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Martin told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Uncle Amos
while Amanda smiled her happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was I right?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Was it
the work of Mertzheimers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was. They must hate me like poison.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, he&#8217;s a copperhead,&#8221;
said Uncle Amos. &#8220;He&#8217;s so pesky low and
mean he can&#8217;t bear to see any one else be honest.
You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; up too far to suit him.
It&#8217;s always so that when abody climbs up the
ladder a little there&#8217;s some settin&#8217; at
the foot ready to joggle it, and the higher abody
climbs the more are there to help try to shake you
down. I guess there&#8217;s mean people everywheres,
even in this here beautiful Garden Spot. But to my
notion you got to just go on doin&#8217; right and
not mind &#8217;em. They&#8217;ll get what they earn
some day. Nobody has yet sowed weeds and got a crop
of potatoes from it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But,&#8221; said the girl,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it. The Mertzheimer
people come from good families and they have certainly
been taught to be different. I can&#8217;t see where
they get their mean streak. With all their money and
chance to improve and opportunities for education and
culture---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, money"--said Uncle Amos--"what
good does money do them if they don&#8217;t have the
right mind to use it? My granny used to say still you
can tie a silk ribbon round a pig&#8217;s neck but
she&#8217;ll wallow in the dirt just the same first
chance she&#8217;ll get. I guess some people are like
that. Well, Martin, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; in to tell
Millie--the women--it&#8217;s all right with you.
They was so upset about it. And won&#8217;t Millie
talk!&#8221; He chuckled at the thought of what that
staunch woman would say about Mr. Mertzheimer. &#8220;Millie
can hit the nail on the head pretty good, pretty good,&#8221;
he said as he ambled into the house.</p>

<p align="left">Martin lingered on the porch with
Amanda till the sound of the Landis supper bell called
him home.</p>

<a name="ch20"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XX</h1>

<h2 align="center">Dinner at Landis&#8217;s</h2>

<p align="left">The following afternoon little Katie
Landis came running down the road and in at the Reist
gate. She greeted Amanda with, &#8220;Mom says you
got to come to our place for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to kill two chickens and have a big time and she wants
you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody coming? Any company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, just you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Tell Mother I said thank you and
I&#8217;ll be glad to come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll run and
tell her. I&#8217;m in a hurry, for me and Emma&#8217;s
playin&#8217; house and I got to get back to my children
before they miss me and set up a howlin&#8217;.&#8221;
She looked very serious as she ran off down the lane,
Amanda smiling after her.</p>

<p align="left">Later, as the girl went down the road
to the Landis home she wondered whose birthday it
might be, or what the cause of celebration. The child
had been in such great haste--but what matter the significance
of the festivity so long as she was asked to enjoy
it!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here&#8217;s Amanda!&#8221;
shouted several of the children gleefully, very boldly
dropping the Miss they were obliged to use during school
hours.</p>

<p align="left">The guest found Mrs. Landis stirring
up a blackberry pone, the three youngest Landis children
watching the progress of it.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, hello, Amanda. I&#8217;m
glad you got here early. Look at these children, all
waitin&#8217; for the dish to lick. Don&#8217;t it
beat all how children like raw dough! I used to, but
I wouldn&#8217;t eat it now if you paid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I. Millie chased me many a time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, people&#8217;s tastes
change in more than one way when they get older. I
guess it&#8217;s a good thing. Here, Katie, take that
doll off of that chair so Amanda can find a place
to sit down. You got every chair in the house littered
up with things. Ach, Amanda, I scold still about their
things laying round but I guess folks that ain&#8217;t
got children would sometimes be glad if they could
see toys and things round the place. They get big
soon enough and the dolls are put away. My, this will
be an awful lonely house when the children all grow
up! I&#8217;d rather see it this way, with their things
scattered all around. But the boys are worse than
the girls. What Charlie don&#8217;t have in his pants
pocket ain&#8217;t in the &#8217;cyclopedia. Martin
was that way, too. He had an old box in the wood-shed
and it was stuffed with all the twine and wire and
nails he could find. But now, Amanda, ain&#8217;t it
good he got that all made right at the bank so they
know he ain&#8217;t a thief?</p>

<p align="left">My, that was an awful sin for Mr.
Mertzheimer to make our Mart out a thief! I just wonder
how he could be so mean and ugly. I guess you wonder
why I asked you up to-night. It ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
special, just a little good time because Martin got
proved honest again. I just said to Mister this morning
that I&#8217;m so glad for Martin I feel like makin&#8217;
something extra for supper and ask you up for you ain&#8217;t
been here for a meal for long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grand to ask me to it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, we don&#8217;t mind you.
You&#8217;re just like one of the family, abody might
say. We won&#8217;t fix like for company, eat in the
room or anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I hope not. I&#8217;m
no company. Let&#8217;s eat in the kitchen and have
everything just as you do when the family&#8217;s alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Landis. &#8220;That
will be more homelike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary helped to set the table in the big kitchen.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Shall I lay the spoons on the
table-cloth like we did when Isabel was here?&#8221;
she asked her mother.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Better put them in the spoon-holder,&#8221;
Amanda told her. &#8220;I&#8217;m no company.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you ain&#8217;t.
I don&#8217;t like tony company like that girl was.
She put on too much when she talked. And she had the
funniest cheeks! Once she wiped her face when it was
hot and pink came off on her handkerchief.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda laughed and kept smiling as
she helped the child set the table for supper. Later
she offered her services to Mrs. Landis. Martin, coming
in from the dusty road, found her before the stove,
one of his mother&#8217;s gingham aprons tied around
her waist, and turning sweet potatoes in a big iron
pan.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, hello!&#8221; he said,
pleasure written in his face. &#8220;Katie ran to meet
me and said I couldn&#8217;t guess who was here for
supper. Has Mother got you working? Um,&#8221; he
sniffed, &#8220;smells awful much like chicken!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; his mother told
him, &#8220;you just hold your nose shut a while! You
and your pop can smell chicken off a mile. But you
dare ring the supper bell, Martin, before you go up-stairs
to wash, so your pop and the boys can come in now
and get ready, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Soon the savory, smoking dishes were
all placed on the big table in the kitchen and the
family with their guest gathered for the meal.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I dare keep my
coat off, Mom?&#8221; asked Mr. Landis, his face flushed
from a long hot day in the fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if Amanda don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why should I? Look at my cool
dress! Take your coat off, Martin. I never could see
why men should roast while we keep comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As Martin stripped the serge coat
off he thought of that other dinner when coats were
kept on and dinner eaten in &#8220;the room&#8221;
because of the presence of one who might take offense
if she were expected to share the plain, every-day
ways of the family. What a fool he had been! Their
best efforts at style and convention must have looked
very amateurish and incomplete to her--what a fool
he had been!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ah, that looks good!&#8221;
Mr. Landis said after he had said grace and everybody
waited for the food to be passed. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll
just hand the platter around and let everybody help
themselves, not so, Mom?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all right.
Start the potatoes once, Martin. Now you must eat,
Amanda. Just make yourself right at home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin, you must eat hearty,
too,&#8221;, said the father. &#8220;Your mom made
this supper for you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;For me? What&#8217;s the idea?
Feeding the prodigal? Fatted calf and all that, Mother?&#8221;
the boy asked, smiling,</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Calf--nothing!&#8221; exclaimed
little Charlie. &#8220;It&#8217;s them two roosters
Mom said long a&#8217;ready she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to kill once and cook and here they are!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Charlie wondered why everybody laughed
at that but he soon forgot about it as his mother
handed him a plate piled high with food.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda scarcely knew what she was
eating that day. Each mouthful had the taste of nectar
and ambrosia to her. If she could <i>belong</i> to
a family like that! She adored her own people and felt
certain that no one could wish for a finer family
than the one in which she had been placed, but it
seemed, by comparison with the Landis one, a very small,
quiet family. She wished she could be a part of both,
make the twelfth in that charming circle in which
she sat that day.</p>

<p align="left">After supper Mrs. Landis turned to
Amanda--"Now you stay a while and hear our new pieces
on the Victrola.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you with the dishes,&#8221;
she offered.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, no, it ain&#8217;t necessary.
Mary and I will get them done up in no time. You just
go in the room and enjoy yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">With little Katie leading the way
and Martin following Amanda went to the sitting-room
and sat down while Martin opened the Victrola.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What do you like?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Something lively? Or do you like soft
music better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like both. What are your new pieces?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;McCormack singing &#8216;Mother Machree---&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I like that! Play that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As the soft, haunting melody of &#8220;Mother
Machree&#8221; sounded in the room Mrs. Landis came
to the door of the sitting-room, dish towel in hand.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; she said after
the last verse, &#8220;I got that record most wore
out a&#8217;ready. Ain&#8217;t it the prettiest song?
When I hear that I think still that if only one of
my nine children feels that way about me I&#8217;m
more than paid for any bother I had with them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then, Mother,&#8221; said Martin,
&#8220;you should feel more than nine times paid,
for we all feel that way about you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Listen, now!&#8221; The mother&#8217;s
eyes were misty as she looked at her first-born.
&#8220;Ach, play it again. I only hope poor Becky knows
how much good her money&#8217;s doin&#8217; us!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Later Martin walked with Amanda up
the moonlit road to her home. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
a lovely time, Martin,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;You
do have the nicest, lively family! I wish we had a
tableful like that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t wish it
at dish-washing time, I bet! But they are a lively
bunch. I wonder sometimes how Mother escapes <i>nerves</i>.
If she feels irritable or tired she seldom shows it.
I believe six of us can ask her questions at once
and she knows how to answer each in its turn. But
Mother never does much useless worrying. That keeps
her youthful and calm. She has often said to us, &#8217;What&#8217;s
the use of worrying? Worrying never gets you anywhere
except into hot water--so what&#8217;s the use of
it?&#8217; That&#8217;s a pet philosophy of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I remember that. I&#8217;ve
heard her say it. Your mother&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;She thinks the same about you,
Amanda, for she said so the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Me?&#8221; The girl turned
her face from him so that the moonlight might not
reveal her joy.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You,&#8221; he said happily,
laughing in boyish contentment. &#8220;We think Amanda
Reist is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The girl was glad they had reached
the gate of her home. She fumbled with the latch and
escaped an answer to the man&#8217;s words. Then they
spoke commonplace good-nights and parted.</p>

<p align="left">That night as she brushed her hair
she stood a long time before the mirror. &#8220;Amanda
Reist,&#8221; she said to the image in the glass, &#8220;you
better take care--next thing you know you&#8217;ll
be falling in love!&#8221; She leaned closer to the
glass. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll have to keep that shine
from my eyes! It&#8217;s there just because Martin
walked home with me and was kind. I don&#8217;t look
as though I need any boneset tea <i>now!"</i></p>

<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXI</h1>

<h2 align="center">Berrying</h2>

<p align="left">The next morning Amanda helped her
mother with the Saturday baking while Millie and Uncle
Amos tended market.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This hot weather the pies get
soft till Sunday if we bake them a&#8217;ready on
Friday,&#8221; Mrs. Reist said to Millie, &#8220;so
Amanda and I can do the bakin&#8217; while you go
to market. I guess we&#8217;ll have a lot of company
again this Sunday, with church near here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, let &#8217;em come,&#8221;
said the hired girl composedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care if you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a good thing we
all like company pretty good, for I think sometimes
people take this place for a regular boarding-house,
the way they drop in at any time, just as like when
we&#8217;re ready to set down for a meal as at any
other hour. Philip said last week, when that Sallie
Snyder dropped in just at dinner, that he&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to paint a sign, &#8216;Mad Dog,&#8217; and hang it
on the gate. But I think we might as well put one
up, &#8216;Meals served at all hours,&#8217; but ach,
that&#8217;s Lancaster County for you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist liked to do her baking
early in the day. So it happened that when Martin
Landis stopped in to see Amanda before he went to his
work in the city he saw on the kitchen table a long
row of pies ready for the oven and Amanda deftly rolling
the edge of another.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he whistled. &#8220;Mrs.
Reist, is that your work or Amanda&#8217;s so early
in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Amanda&#8217;s! My granny used
to say still that no girl was ready to get married
till she could roll out a thin pie dough. I guess my
girl is almost ready, for she got hers nice and thin
this morning. Ach,&#8221; she thought in dismay as
she saw the girl&#8217;s face flush, &#8220;now why
did I say that? I didn&#8217;t think how it would
sound. But Amanda needn&#8217;t mind Martin!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Merry little twinkles played around
Martin&#8217;s gray eyes as he answered, &#8220;I
see. Looks as if Amanda&#8217;s ready for a husband--if
she&#8217;s going to feed him on pies!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;On pies--Martin Landis!&#8221;
scorned the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;d have a dyspeptic
on my hands after a few days of pie diet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d make a pretty good nurse,
I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Nurse--not me! The only thing
I know how to nurse is hurt birds and lame bunnies
and such things. You just lay them in a box and feed
them, and if they get well you clap your hands, and
if they die you put some leaves and flowers on them
and bury them out in the woods--remember how we used
to do that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do I? I should say I do! The
time we had the fence hackey that Lyman Mertzheimer
hurt with a stone--&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, and I nursed him and fed
him, and when I let him go he bit my finger! I remember
that! I was so cross at him I cried.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Wretch that he was,&#8221;
said Martin. &#8220;But if we begin talking about those
days I won&#8217;t get to work. I stopped in to ask
you to go berrying with us this afternoon. I get out
of the bank early. We can go up to the woods back
of the schoolhouse. The youngsters are anxious to go,
and Mother won&#8217;t let them go alone, since that
copperhead was killed near here. I promised to take
them, and we&#8217;d all like to have you come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d love to go. I&#8217;ll
be all ready. I haven&#8217;t gone for blackberries
all season.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s true, we&#8217;ve
been missing lots of fun.&#8221; He looked at her as
though he were seeing her after a long absence. Somehow,
he had missed something worth while from his life
during the time his head had been turned by Isabel,
and he had passed Amanda with a smile and a greeting
and had no hours of companionship with her. Why, he
didn&#8217;t remember that her eyes were so bright,
that her red hair waved so becomingly, that--</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring a kettle,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pick till I fill
it, too, just as we did when we were youngsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ll meet you at the schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The spur of mountains near Crow Hill
was a favorite berrying range for the people of that
section of Lancaster County. In July and August huckleberries,
elders and blackberries grew there in fragrant luxuriance.</p>

<p align="left">When Amanda, in an old dress of cool
green, a wide-brimmed hat on her head, came in sight
of the schoolhouse, she saw the Landis party approaching
it from the other direction. She swung her tin pail
in greeting.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Amanda!&#8221;
the children shouted and ran to meet her, tin pails
clanging and dust flying.</p>

<p align="left">Martin, too, wore old clothes that
would be none the worse for meeting with briars or
crushed berries. A wide straw hat perched on his head
made Amanda think, &#8220;He looks like a grown-up
edition of Whittier&#8217;s Barefoot Boy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here we are, all ready,&#8221;
said the leader, as they started off to the crude
rail fence. Martin would have helped Amanda over the
fence, but she ran from him, put up one foot, and
was over it in a trice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Still a nimble-toes,&#8221;
he said, laughing. &#8220;Mary, can you do as well?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Pooh, yes! Who can&#8217;t
climb a fence?&#8221; The little girl was over it in
a minute. The smaller children lay flat on the ground
and squirmed through under the lower rail, while one
of the boys climbed up, balanced himself on the top
rail, then leaped into the grass.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see some berries!&#8221;
cried Katie, and began to pick them.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;We&#8217;ll go in farther,&#8221;
said Martin. &#8220;The bushes near the road have been
almost stripped. Come on, keep on the path and watch
out for snakes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">There was a well-defined, narrow trail
through the timbered land. Though the weeds had been
trodden down along each side of it there were dense
portions where snakes might have found an ideal home.
After a long walk the little party was in the heart
of the woods and blackberry bushes, dark with clusters,
waited for their hands. Berries soon rattled in the
tin pails, though at first many a handful was eaten
and lips were stained red by the sweet juice. They
wandered from bush to bush, picking busily, with many
exclamations--"Oh, look what a big bunch!&#8221; &#8220;My
pail&#8217;s almost full!&#8221; Little Katie and Charlie
soon grew tired of the picking and wandered around
the path in search of treasures. They found them--three
pretty blue feathers, dropped, no doubt, by some screaming
blue jay, a handful of green acorns in their little
cups, a few pebbles that appealed to them, one lone,
belated anemone, blooming months after its season.</p>

<p align="left">The pails were almost filled and the
party was moving up the woods to another patch of
berries when little Mary turned to Amanda and said,
&#8220;Ach, Amanda, tell us that story about the Bear
Charm Song.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, do!&#8221; seconded Charlie.
&#8220;The one you told us once in school last winter.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda smiled, and as the little party
walked along close together through the woods, she
began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Once the Indians lived where we are living
now---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, did they?&#8221; interrupted
Charlie. &#8220;Real Indians, with bows and arrows
and all?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, real Indians, bows and
arrows and all! They owned all the land before the
white man came and drove them off. But now the Indians
are far away from here and they are different from
the ones we read about in the history books. The Indians
now are more like the poor birds people put in cages---&#8221;
Her eyes gleamed and her face grew eloquent with expression
as she thought of the gross injustice meted out to
some of the red men in this land of the free.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Go on, Manda, go on with the
story,&#8221; cried the children. Only Martin had
seen the look in her eyes, that mother-look of compassion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll go on.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And, Charlie,&#8221; said Mary,
&#8220;you keep quiet now and don&#8217;t break in
when Manda talks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; the story-teller
resumed, &#8220;the Indians who lived out in the woods,
far from towns or cities, had to find all their own
food. They caught fish, shot animals and birds, planted
corn and gathered berries. Some of them they ate at
once, but many of them they dried and stored away
for winter use. While the older Indians did harder
work, the little Indian children ran off to the woods
and gathered the berries. But one thing they had to
look out for--bears! Great big bears lived in the
woods and they are very fond of sweet things. The bears
would amble along, peel great handfuls of ripe berries
from the bushes with their big clawed paws and eat
them. So all good Indian mothers taught their children
a Bear Charm Song to sing as they gathered berries.
Whenever the bears heard the Bear Charm Song they
went to some other part of the woods and left the
children to pick their berries unharmed. But once
there was a little Indian boy who wouldn&#8217;t mind
his mother. He went to the woods one day to gather
berries, but he wouldn&#8217;t sing the Bear Charm
Song, not he! So he picked berries and picked berries,
and all of a sudden a great big bear stood by him.
Then the little Indian boy, who wouldn&#8217;t mind
his mother, began to sing the Bear Charm Song. But
it was too late. The great big bear put his big paws
around the little boy and squeezed him, squeezed him,
tighter and tighter and tighter--till the little boy
who wouldn&#8217;t mind his mother was changed into
a tiny black bat. Then he flew back to his mother,
but she didn&#8217;t know him, and so she chased him
and said, &#8217;Go away! Little black bird of the
night, go away!&#8217; And that is where the bats
first came from.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that a good story?&#8221;
said Charlie as Amanda ended. &#8220;Tell us another.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not now. Perhaps after a while,&#8221;
she promised. &#8220;Here&#8217;s another patch of
berries. Shall we pick here?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, fill the pails,&#8221;
said Martin, &#8220;then we&#8217;ll be ready for the
next number on the program. It seems Amanda&#8217;s
the committee of one to entertain us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But the next number on the program
was furnished by an unexpected participant. The berrying
party was busy picking when a crash was heard as if
some heavy body were running wild through the leaves
and sticks of the woods near by.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Charlie, &#8220;I
bet that&#8217;s a bear! Manda, sing a Bear Charm
Song!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; echoed Katie in
alarm, and ran to the side of Amanda, while Martin
lifted his head and stood, alert, looking into the
woods in the direction of the noise. The crashing
drew nearer, and then the figure of a man came running
wildly through the bushes, waving his hands frantically
in the air, then pressing them to his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lyman Mertzheimer!&#8221; Amanda
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;With hornets after him,&#8221; added Martin.</p>

<p>The children, reassured, ran to the newcomer.</p>

<p align="left">It was Lyman Mertzheimer, his face
distorted and swollen, his necktie streaming from
one shoulder, where he had torn it in a mad effort
to beat off the angry hornets whose nest he had disturbed
out of sheer joy in the destruction and an audacious
idea that no insect could scare him away or worst
him in a fight. He had underestimated the fiery temper
of the hornets and their concentrated and persistent
methods of defending their home. After he had run
wildly through the woods for fifteen minutes and struck
out repeatedly the insects left him, just as he reached
the berrying party. But the hornets had wreaked their
anger upon him; face, hands and neck bore evidence
of the battle they had waged.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;First time hornets got me!&#8221;
he said crossly as he neared the little party. &#8220;Oh,
you needn&#8217;t laugh!&#8221; he cried in angry tones
as Charlie snickered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you look funny--all blotchy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The stung man allowed his anger to
burst out in oaths. &#8220;Guess you think it&#8217;s
funny, too,&#8221; he said to Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No. I&#8217;m sure it hurts,&#8221;
she said, though she knew he deserved no pity from
her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;We all know that it hurts,&#8221;
said Martin. But there was scant sympathy in his voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Smear mud on,&#8221; suggested
Mary. &#8220;Once I got stung by a bumblebee when
he went in a hollyhock and I held the flower shut so
he couldn&#8217;t get out, and he stung me through
the flower. Mom put mud on and it helped.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mud!&#8221; stormed Lyman,
stepping about in the bush and twisting his head in
pain. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any mud in Lancaster
County now. The whole place is dry as punk!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;If you had some of the mud
you slung at me recently it would come in handy now,&#8221;
Martin could not refrain from saying.</p>

<p align="left">Another oath greeted his words. Then
the stung young man started off down the road to find
relief from his smarts, ignoring the fling.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Amanda, &#8220;well,
of all things! For him to tackle a hornets&#8217;
nest! Just for the fun of it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But he got his come-uppance
for once! Got it from the hornets,&#8221; said Martin.
&#8220;Serves him right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;But that hurts,&#8221; said
Mary sympathetically. &#8220;Hornets hurt awful bad!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Martin as
they turned homeward. &#8220;But he&#8217;s getting
paid for all the mean tricks he&#8217;s played on
other people.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mebbe God made the hornets
sting him if he&#8217;s a bad man,&#8221; said Charlie.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;We all get what we give out,&#8221;
agreed Martin. &#8220;Lyman Mertzheimer will feel
those hornet stings for a few days. While I&#8217;ve
always been taught not to rejoice at the misfortunes
of others I&#8217;m not sorry I saw him. I&#8217;ll
call our account square now. You pitied him, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he asked Amanda suddenly. &#8220;I saw
it in your eyes. So did Mary and Katie.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Of course I pitied him,&#8221;
she confessed. &#8220;I&#8217;d feel sorry for anything
or anybody who suffers. I know it serves him right,
that he&#8217;s earned worse than that, and yet I
would have relieved him if I could have done so. Nature
meant that we should be decent, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The man was thoughtful for a moment.
&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. It is a woman&#8217;s nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have us different?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No--no--we wouldn&#8217;t have
you different. Many of the best men would be mere
brutes if women&#8217;s pity and tenderness and forgiveness
were taken out of their lives--we wouldn&#8217;t have
you different.&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch22"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXII</h1>

<h2 align="center">On the Mountain Top</h2>

<p align="left">The following Sunday at noon Martin
passed the Reist farmhouse as he drove his mother
and several of the children to Mennonite church at
Landisville. After the service he passed that way again
and noticed several cars stopping at Reists&#8217;.
Evidently they were entertaining a number of visitors
for Sunday dinner after the service, as is the custom
in rural Lancaster County. The big porch was filled
with people who rocked or leaned idly against the
pillars, while in the big kitchen Millie, Amanda and
Mrs. Reist worked near the hot stove and prepared an
appetizing dinner for them.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda did not shirk her portion of
the necessary work, but rebellion was in her heart
as she noted her mother&#8217;s flushed, tired face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother, if you&#8217;d only
feel that Millie and I could get the dinner without
you! It&#8217;s a shame to have you in this kitchen
on a day like this!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I&#8217;m not so hot.
I&#8217;m not better than you or Millie,&#8221; the
mother insisted, and stuck to her post, while Amanda
murmured, &#8220;This Sunday visiting--how I hate
it! We&#8217;ve outgrown the need of it now, especially
with automobiles.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But at length the meal was placed
upon the table, the guests gathered from porches and
lawn and an hour later the dishes were washed and
everything at peace once more in the kitchen. Then
Amanda walked out to the garden at the rear of the
house.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ooh,&#8221; she sighed in relief,
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s over! Visiting on
such a day should be made a misdemeanor!&#8221; She
pulled idly on a zinnia that lifted its globular red
head in the hot August sun.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hey, Sis,&#8221; came Phil&#8217;s
voice to her, &#8220;he wants you on the &#8217;phone!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Who&#8217;s he?&#8221; she
asked as the boy ran out to her in the garden.</p>

<p>They turned to the house, talking as they went.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, Sis, you know who <i>he</i>
is! He&#8217;s coming round here all the time lately.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">A gentle shove from the girl rewarded
the boy for his teasing, but he was not easily daunted.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how
that old Mrs. Haldeman who kept tine candy store near
the market house in Lancaster used to call her husband
<i>he</i>? She never called him Mister or Mr. Haldeman,
just <i>he</i>, and you could feel she would have
written it in italics if she could.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, that was all right, there
was only one <i>he</i> in the world so far as she
was concerned. But do you remember, Phil, the time
Mother took us in her store to buy candy and we talked
to her canary and the old woman said, &#8217;Ach,
yes, I think still how good birds got it! I often
wish I was a canary, but then he would have to be one
too!&#8217; We disgraced Mother by giggling fit to
kill ourselves. But the old woman just smiled at us
and gave us each a pink and white striped peppermint
stick. Now run along, Phil, don&#8217;t be eavesdropping,&#8221;
she said as they reached the hall and she sat down
to answer the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Amanda?&#8221; came over the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Got a houseful of company?
It seemed like that when we drove past. Overflow meeting
on the porch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What I wanted to know is--are
there any young people among the visitors, that makes
it a matter of courtesy for you to stay at home all
afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are all older people to-day, and a
few little children.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good! Then how would you like
to have a little picnic, just we two? I want to get
away from Victrola music and children&#8217;s questions
and four walls, and I thought you might have a similar
longing.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mental telepathy, Martin! That&#8217;s
just what I was thinking as I was out in the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll call for you
and we&#8217;ll go up past the sandpit to that hilltop
where the breeze blows even on a day like this.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">When Martin came for her she was ready,
a lunch tucked under one arm, two old pillows in the
other. She had given the red hair a few pats, added
several hairpins, slipped off her white dress and buttoned
up a pale green chambray one with cool white collar
and cuffs. She stood ready, attractive, as Martin
entered the lawn.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say!&#8221; he whistled. &#8220;You
did that in short order! I thought it took girls hours
to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then you&#8217;re like Solomon;
you can&#8217;t understand the ways of women!&#8221;
She laughed as she handed him the lunch-box.</p>

<p align="left">Her calm efficiency puzzled him. Lately
he was discovering so many undreamed of qualities
in this lively friend of his childhood. He was beginning
to feel some of the wonder those people must have felt
whose children played with pebbles that were one day
discovered to be priceless uncut diamonds. Until that
day she had found him prostrate in her moccasin woods
he had thought of her as just Amanda Reist, a nice,
jolly girl with a quick temper if you tried her too
hard and a quick tongue to express it, but a good
comrade and a pleasant companion if you treated her
fairly.</p>

<p align="left">Then his attitude had undergone a
change. After that day of his great unhappiness he
thought of her as a woman, staunch, courageous, yet
gentle and feminine, one who had faith in her old friend,
who could comfort a man when he was downcast and help
him raise his head again. A wonderful woman she was!
One who loved pretty clothes and things modern and
yet appreciated the charm of the old-fashioned, and
seemed to dovetail perfectly into the plain grooves
of her people and his with their quaint old dress
and houses and manners. A woman, too, who had an intense
love for the great outdoors. Not the shallow, pretentious
love that would call forth gushing rhapsodies about
moonlight or sunsets or the spectacular alone in nature,
but a sincere, deep-rooted love that shone in her
eyes as she stooped to see more plainly the tracery
of veins in a fallen leaf and moved her to gentle
speech to the birds, butterflies and woodland creatures
as though they could understand and answer.</p>

<p align="left">As they walked down the country road
he looked at her. He had a way of noticing women&#8217;s
clothes and had become an observant judge of their
becomingness. In her growing-up days Amanda had been
frequently angered by his frank, unsolicited remarks
about the colors she wore--this blue was off color
for her red hair, or that golden brown was just the
thing. Later she grew accustomed to his remarks and
rather expected them. They still disconcerted her
at times, but she had long ago ceased to grow angry
about them.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That green&#8217;s the color
for you to-day,&#8221; he said, as they went along.
&#8220;Do you know, I&#8217;ve often thought I&#8217;d
like to see you in a black gown and a string of real
jade beads around your neck.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Jade! Was there ever a red
head who didn&#8217;t wish she had a string of jade
beads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be great!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;So would the price,&#8221;
she told him, laughing. &#8220;A string of real jade
would cost as much as a complete outfit of clothes
I wear.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then you should have black
hair and cheap coral ones would do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, Martin,&#8221; she said
in surprise, &#8220;you <i>are</i> studying color
combinations, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, not exactly; I&#8217;m
not interested in all colors. But say, that reminds
me--I saw a girl in Lancaster last winter who had hair
like yours and about the same coloring. She wore a
brown suit and brown hat and furs--it was great.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have that.&#8221;
Daughter of Eve! She liked it because he did! &#8220;But
don&#8217;t speak about furs on a day like this! It&#8217;s
hot--too hot, Martin, for a houseful of company, don&#8217;t
you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hot to stand and cook for extra people.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, perhaps it&#8217;s wicked,
but I hate this Sunday visiting the people of Lancaster
County indulge in! I never did like it!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m not keen about it
myself. Sunday seems to me to be a day to go to church
and rest and enjoy your family, sometimes to go off
to the woods like this. But a houseful of buzzing
visitors swarming through it-- whew! it does spoil
the Sabbath.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I never did like to visit,&#8221;
confessed the girl. &#8220;Not unless I went to people
I really cared for. When we were little and Mother
would take Phil and me to visit relatives or friends
I merely liked I&#8217;d be there a little while and
then I&#8217;d tug at Mother&#8217;s skirt and beg,
&#8217;Mom, we want to go home.&#8217; I suppose I
spoiled many a visit for her. I was self-willed even
then.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You are a stubborn person,&#8221;
he said, with so different a meaning that Amanda flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am. And I have a nasty temper, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know,&#8221;
he consoled her, &#8220;that a temper controlled makes
a strong personality? George Washington had one, the
history books say, but he made it serve him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And that&#8217;s no easy achievement.&#8221;
The girl spoke from her own experience. &#8220;It&#8217;s
like pulling molars to press your lips together and
be quiet when you want to rear and tear and stamp your
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, come down to hard facts,
and how many of us will have to admit that we have
feelings like that at times? There is still a good
share of the primitive man left in our natures. We&#8217;re
not saints. Why, even the churches that believe in
saints don&#8217;t canonize mortals until they have
been a hundred years dead--they want to be sure they
are dead and their mortal weaknesses forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda laughed. A moment later they
turned from the country road and followed a narrower
path that was bordered on one side by green fields
and on the other by a strip of woods, an irregular
arm reaching out from Amanda&#8217;s moccasin haunt.
The road led up-hill at a sharp angle, so that when
the traveler reached the top, panting and tired, there
stretched before him in delightful panorama a view
of Lancaster County that more than compensated for
the discomfort and effort of the climb.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda and Martin stood facing that
sight. Behind them lay the cool, tree-clad hill, before
them the blue August sky looked down on Lancaster
County farms, whose houses and red barns seemed dropped
like kindergarten toys into the midst of undulating
green fields. One could sit or stand under the sheltering
shade of the trees along the edge of the woods and
yet look up to the sky or out upon the Garden Spot
and farther off, to the blue, hazy mountain ridge
that touched the sky-line and cut off the view of
what lay beyond.</p>

<p align="left">Martin threw the pillows on the ground
and they sat down in the cool shade.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Can anything beat this?&#8221;
he asked lazily as he ruffled the dry leaves about
him with his hands. &#8220;You know, Amanda, I could
never understand why, with my love for outdoors, I
can&#8217;t be a farmer. When I was a boy I used to
consider it the natural thing for me to do as my father
did. I did help him, but I never liked the work. You
couldn&#8217;t coax the other boys to the city; they&#8217;d
rather pitch hay or plant corn. And yet I like nothing
better than to be out in the open. During the summer
I&#8217;m out in the garden after I come home from
the city, and that much of working the soil I like,
but for a steady job--not for me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s best to do work
one likes,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Not every person
who likes outdoors was meant to be a farmer. Be glad
you like to be out in the open. But I can&#8217;t
conceive of any person not liking it. I could sit
and look at the sky for one whole day. It&#8217;s so
encouraging. Sometimes when I walk home from school
after a hard day and I look down on the road and think
over the problems of handling certain trying children
so as to get the best out of them and the latent best
in them developed, I look up all of a sudden and the
sky is so wonderful that, somehow, my troubles seem
trivial. It&#8217;s just as though the sky were saying,
&#8217;Child, you&#8217;ve been looking down so long
and worrying about little things that you&#8217;ve
forgotten that the sky is blue and the clouds are still
sailing over you.&#8217; And, Martin, don&#8217;t
you like the stars? I never get tired of looking at
them. I never care to gaze at the full moon unless
there are clouds sailing over her. She&#8217;s too
big and brazen, too compelling. But the twinkle of
the stars and the sudden flashing out of dim ones you
didn&#8217;t see at first always makes me feel like
singing. Ever feel that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I couldn&#8217;t put it all into words
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;she
has the mind of a poet, the heart of a child, the
soul of a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I read somewhere,&#8221; she
went on, as though certain of his understanding and
sharing her mood, &#8220;that the Pagans said man was
made to stand upright so that he might raise his face
to heaven and his eyes to the stars. Somehow, it seems
those old Pagans had a finer conception of many vital
truths than some of us have in this age.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s true. We have
them beaten in many ways, but when we come across
a thing like that we stop to think and wonder where
they got it. I always did like mythology. Pandora
and her box, Clytie and her emblem of constancy, and
Ulysses--what schoolboy escaped the thrills of Ulysses?
I bet you pitied Orpheus!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I did! But aren&#8217;t we
serious for a picnic? Next thing we know one of us
will be saying thirdly, fourthly, or amen!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know--it suits
me. You&#8217;re so sensible, Amanda, it&#8217;s a
pleasure to talk with you. Most girls are so frothy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No disparaging remarks about
our sex,&#8221; she said lightly, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll
retaliate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he challenged,
&#8220;I dare you to! What&#8217;s the worst fault
in mere man?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She raised her hand in protest. &#8220;I
wash my hands of that! But I will say that if most
girls are frothy, as you say, it&#8217;s because most
men seem to like them that way. Confess now, how many
shallow, frothy girls grow into old maids? It&#8217;s
generally the butterfly that occasions the merry chase,
straw hats out to catch it. You seldom see a straw
hat after a bee.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Amanda, that&#8217;s not
fair, not like you!&#8221; But he thought ruefully
of Isabel and her butterfly attractions. &#8220;I
admit we follow the butterflies but sometimes we wake
up and see our folly. True, men don&#8217;t chase
honeybees, but they have a wholesome respect for them
and build houses for them. After all, the real men
generally appreciate the real women. Sometimes the
appreciation comes too late for happiness, but it
seldom fails to come. No matter how appearances belie
it, it&#8217;s a fact, nevertheless, that in this
crazy world of to-day the sincere, real girl is still
appreciated. The frilly Gladys, Gwendolyns and What-nots
still have to yield first place to the old-fashioned
Rebeccas, Marys and Amandas.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Her heart thumped at the words. She
became flustered and said the first thing that came
into her head to say, &#8220;I like that, calling me
old-fashioned! But we won&#8217;t quarrel about it.
Let&#8217;s eat our lunch; that will keep us from
too much talking for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Martin handed her the box. He was
silent as she opened it. She noted his preoccupation,
his gray eyes looking off to the distant fields.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Come back to earth!&#8221;
she ordered. &#8220;What are you dreaming about?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I was just thinking that you
<i>are</i> old-fashioned. I&#8217;m glad you are.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not!&#8221;
she retorted. &#8220;Come on, eat. I just threw in
some rolls and cold chicken and pickles and a few
peaches.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The man turned and gave his attention
to the lunch and ate with evident enjoyment, but several
times Amanda felt his keen eyes scrutinizing her face.
&#8220;What ails him?&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;This is great, this is just
the thing!&#8221; he told her several times during
the time of lunch. &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this often,
come up here where the air is pure.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right,&#8221; she agreed
readily. &#8220;It will do you good to get up in the
hills. I don&#8217;t see how you stand being housed
in a city in the summer! It must be like those awful
days in the early spring or in the fall when I&#8217;m
in the schoolroom and rebel because I want to be outdoors.
I rebel every minute when the weather is nice, do
it subconsciously while I&#8217;m teaching the states
and capitals or hearing tables or giving out spelling
words. Something just keeps saying inside of me, &#8217;I
want to be out, want to be out, be out, be out!&#8217;
It&#8217;s a wonder I don&#8217;t say it out loud
sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;If you did you&#8217;d hear
a mighty echo, I bet! Every kid in the room would
say it after you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure of that.
I feel like a slave driver when I make them study
on days that were made for the open. But it&#8217;s
the only way, I suppose. We have to learn to knuckle
very early.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, but it&#8217;s a great
old world, just the same, don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s the only one I ever
tried, so I&#8217;m satisfied to stay on it a while
longer,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p align="left">They laughed at that as only Youth
can laugh at remarks that are not clever, only interesting
to each other because of the personality of the speaker.</p>

<p align="left">So the afternoon passed and the two
descended again to the dusty country road, each feeling
refreshed and stimulated by the hours spent together.</p>

<a name="ch23"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXIII</h1>

<h2 align="center">Tests</h2>

<p align="left">That September Amanda began her third
year of teaching at Crow Hill.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I declare,&#8221; Millie said,
&#8220;how quick the time goes! Here&#8217;s your third
year o&#8217; teachin&#8217; started a&#8217;ready.
A body gets old fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll soon be an old maid school
teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, mebbe not!&#8221; The
hired girl had lost none of her frankness. &#8220;I
notice that Mart Landis sneaks round here a good bit
this while past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, Millie, he&#8217;s not here often.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No, o&#8217; course not! He
just stops in in the afternoon about every other day
with a book or something of excuse like that, and about
every other day in the morning he&#8217;s likely to
happen to drop in to get the book back, and then in
between that he comes and you go out for a walk after
flowers or birds or something, and then between times
there he comes with something his mom told him to
ask or bring or something like that --no, o&#8217;
course not, he don&#8217;t come often! Not at all!
I guess he&#8217;s just neighborly, ain&#8217;t, Amanda?&#8221;
Millie chuckled at her own wit and Amanda could not
long keep a frown upon her face.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Of course, Millie,&#8221; she
said with an assumed air of indifference, &#8220;the
Landis people have always been neighborly. Pennsylvania
Dutch are great for that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">It was not from Millie alone that
Amanda had to take teasing. Philip, always ready for
amusement, was at times almost insufferable in the
opinion of his sister.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
Mart Landis&#8217;s home?&#8221; the boy asked innocently
one day at the supper table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Uncle Amos. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bite.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, he seems to be out of
it a great deal; he spends half of his time in our
house. I think, Uncle Amos, as head of the house here,
you should ask him what his intentions are.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Phil!&#8221; Amanda&#8217;s
protest was vehement. &#8220;You make me as tired as
some other people round here do. As soon as a man
walks down the road with a girl the whole matter is
settled--they&#8217;ll surely marry soon! It would
be nice if people would attend to their own affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Makes me tired too,&#8221;
said Philip fervently. &#8220;Last week I met that
Sarah from up the road and naturally walked to the
car with her. You all know what a fright she is--cross-eyed,
pigeon-toed, and as brilliant mentally as a dark night
in the forest. When I got into the car I heard some
one say, &#8217;Did you see Philip Reist with that
girl? I wonder if he keeps company with her.&#8217;
Imagine!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Serves you right,&#8221; Amanda
told him with impish delight. &#8220;I hope every
cross-eyed, pigeon-toed girl in the county meets you
and walks with you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Feel better now, Sis?&#8221;
His grin brought laughter to the crowd and Amanda&#8217;s
peeved feeling was soon gone.</p>

<p align="left">It was true, Martin Landis spent many
hours at the Reist farmhouse. He seemed filled with
an insatiable desire for the companionship of Amanda.
Scarcely a day passed without some glimpse of him at
the Reist home.</p>

<p align="left">Just what that companionship meant
to the young man he did not stop to analyze at first.
He knew he was happy with Amanda, enjoyed her conversation,
felt a bond between them in their love for the vast
outdoors, but he never went beyond that. Until one
day in early November when he was walking down the
lonely road after a pleasant evening with Amanda.
He paused once to look up at the stars, remembering
what the girl had said concerning them, how they comforted
and inspired her. A sudden rush of feeling came to
him as he leaned on the rail fence and looked up....
&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s
time you take account of yourself. What&#8217;s all
this friendship with your old companion leading to?
Do you love Amanda?&#8221; The &#8220;stars in their
courses&#8221; seemed to twinkle her name, every leafless
tree along the road she loved seemed to murmur it
to him--Amanda! It was suddenly the sweetest name
in the whole world to him!</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, I know it now!&#8221; he
said softly to himself under the quiet sky. &#8220;I
love her! What a woman she is! What a heart she has,
what a heart! I want her for my wife; she&#8217;s
the only one I want to have with me &#8217;Till death
us do part&#8217;--that&#8217;s a fair test. Why, I&#8217;ve
been wondering why I enjoyed each minute with her
and just longed to get to see her as often as possible--fool,
not to recognize love when it came to me! But I know
it now! I&#8217;m as sure of it as I am sure those
stars, her stars, are shining up there in the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As he stood a moment silently looking
into the starry heavens some portion of an old story
came to him. &#8220;My love is as fair as the stars
and well-nigh as remote and inaccessible.&#8221; Could
he win the love of a girl like Amanda Reist? She gave
him her friendship freely, would she give her love
also? A woman like Amanda could never be satisfied
with half-gods, she would love as she did everything
else--intensely, entirely! He remembered reading that
propinquity often led people into mistakes, that constant
companionship was liable to awaken a feeling that
might masquerade as love. Well, he&#8217;d be fair
to her, he&#8217;d let separation prove his love.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll
do,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;Next week I&#8217;m to
go on my vacation and I&#8217;ll be gone two weeks.
I&#8217;ll not write to her and of course I won&#8217;t
see her. Perhaps &#8217;Absence will make the heart
grow fonder&#8217; with her. I hope so! It will be
a long two weeks for me, but when I come back--&#8221;
He flung out his arms to the night as though they
could bring to him at once the form of the one he loved.</p>

<p align="left">So it happened that after a very commonplace
goodbye given to Amanda in the presence of the entire
Reist household Martin Landis left Lancaster County
a few weeks before Thanksgiving and journeyed to South
Carolina to spend a quiet vacation at a mountain resort.</p>

<p align="left">To Amanda Reist, pegging away in the
schoolroom during the gray November days, his absence
caused depression. He had said nothing about letters
but she naturally expected them, friendly little notes
to tell her what he was doing and how he was enjoying
the glories of the famous mountains of the south.
But no letters came from Martin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she bit her lip
after a week had gone and he was still silent. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t care! He writes home; the children tell
me he says the scenery is so wonderful where he is--why
can&#8217;t he send me just one little note? But I&#8217;m
not going to care. I&#8217;ve been a fool long enough.
I should know by this time that it&#8217;s a case
of &#8216;Out of sight, out of mind.&#8217; I&#8217;m
about done with castles in Spain! All my sentimental
dreams about my knight, all my rosy visions are, after
all, of that substance of which all dreams are made.
I suppose if I had been practical and sensible like
other girls I could have made myself like Lyman Mertzheimer
or some other ordinary country boy and settled down
into a contented woman on a farm. Why couldn&#8217;t
I long ago have put away my girlish illusions about
knights and castles in Spain? I wonder if, after all,
gold eagles are better and more to be desired than
the golden roofs of our dream castles? If an automobile
like Lyman Mertzheimer drives is not to be preferred
to Sir Galahad&#8217;s pure white steed! I&#8217;ve
clung to my romanticism and what has it brought me?
It might have been wiser to let go my dreams, sweep
the illusions from my eyes and settle down to a sordid,
everyday existence as the wife of some man, like Lyman
Mertzheimer, who has no eye for the beauties of nature
but who has two eyes for me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Poor Amanda, destruction of her dream
castles was perilously imminent! The golden turrets
were tottering and the substance of which her dreams
were made was becoming less ethereal. If Lyman Mertzheimer
came to her then and renewed his suit would she give
him a more encouraging answer than those she had given
in former times? Amanda&#8217;s hour of weakness and
despair was upon her. It was a propitious moment for
the awakening of the forces of her lower nature which
lay quiescent in her, as it dwells in us all--very
few escape the Jekyll-Hyde combination.</p>

<p align="left">When Martin Landis returned to Lancaster
County he had a vagrant idea of what the South Carolina
mountains are like. He would have told you that the
trees there all murmur the name of Amanda, that the
birds sing her name, the waterfalls cry it aloud!
During his two weeks of absence from her his conviction
was affirmed--he knew without a shadow of doubt that
he loved her madly. All of Mrs. Browning&#8217;s tests
he had applied--</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Unless you can muse in a crowd
all day,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the absent face that fixed
you;<br>
&#160;&#160;Unless you can love, as the angels may,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the breadth of heaven
betwixt you;<br>
&#160;&#160;Unless you can dream that his faith is
fast,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through behoving and unbehoving;<br>
&#160;&#160;Unless you can die when the dream is past--<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh, never call it loving!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda was enthroned in his heart,
he knew it at last! How blind he had been! He knew
now what his mother had meant one day when she told
him, &#8220;Some of you men are blinder&#8217;n bats!
Bats do see at night!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As he rode from Lancaster on the little
crowded trolley his thoughts were all of Amanda--would
she give him the answer he desired? Could he waken
in her heart something stronger than the old feeling
of friendship, which was not now enough?</p>

<p align="left">He stepped from the car--now he would
be with her soon. He meant to stop in at the Reist
farmhouse and ask her the great question. He could
wait no longer.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Hello, Landis,&#8221; a voice
greeted him as he alighted from the car. He turned
and faced Lyman Mertzheimer, a smiling, visibly happy
Lyman.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, hello,&#8221; Martin said,
not cordially, for he had no love for the trouble-maker.
&#8220;I see you&#8217;re in Lancaster County for your
vacation again.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, home from college for
Thanksgiving. I hear you&#8217;ve been away for several
weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The college boy fell into step beside
Martin, who would have turned and gone in another
direction if he had not been so eager to see Amanda.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, Landis,&#8221; continued
the unwelcome companion. &#8220;I&#8217;m home for
Thanksgiving. It&#8217;ll be a great day for me this
year. By the way, I saw Amanda Reist a number of times
since I&#8217;m here. Perhaps you&#8217;ll be interested
to know that Amanda&#8217;s promised to marry me--congratulate
me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;To marry you! Amanda?&#8221;
Martin&#8217;s face blanched and his heart seemed
turned to lead.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why not?&#8221; The other laughed
softly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not as black as I&#8217;m
painted, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I--I hope not,&#8221; Martin
managed to say, his body suddenly seeming to be rooted
in the ground. His feet dragged as he walked along.
Amanda to marry Lvman Mertzheimer! What a crazv world
it was all of a sudden. What a slow, poky idiot he
had been not to try for the prize before it was snatched
from him!</p>

<p align="left">Lyman, rejoicing over the misery so
plainly written in the face of Martin, walked boldly
down the middle of the road, while Martin&#8217;s feet
lagged so he could not keep pace with the man who had
imparted the bewildering news. Martin kept along the
side of the road, scuffing along in the grass, thinking
bitter thoughts about the arrogant youth who walked
in the middle of the road. The honk, honk of a speeding
automobile fell heedlessly upon the ears of both, till
Martin looked back in sudden alarm. His startled eyes
saw a car tearing down the road like a huge demon
on wheels, its driver evidently trusting to the common
sense of the man in the way to get out of the path
of danger in time. But Lyman walked on in serene preoccupation,
gloating over the unlucky, unhappy man who was following.
With a cry of warning Martin rushed to the side of
the other man and pushed him from the path of the
car, but when the big machine came to a standstill
Martin Landis lay in the dusty road, his eyes closed,
a thin red stream of blood trickling down his face.</p>

<p align="left">The driver was concerned. &#8220;He&#8217;s
knocked out,&#8221; he said as he bent over the still
form. &#8220;I&#8217;m a doctor and I&#8217;ll take
him home and fix him up. He&#8217;s a plucky chap,
all right! He kept you from cashing in, probably.
Say, young fellow, are you deaf? I honked loud enough
to be heard a mile. Only for him you&#8217;d be in
the dust there and you&#8217;d have caught it full.
The car just grazed him. It&#8217;s merely a scalp
wound,&#8221; he said in relief as he examined the
prostrate figure. &#8220;Know where he lives?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, just a little distance
beyond the schoolhouse down this road.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll take him home.
I can&#8217;t say how sorry I am it happened. Give
me a lift, will you? You sit in the back seat and hold
him while I drive.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Lyman did not relish the task assigned
to him but the doctor&#8217;s tones admitted of no
refusal. Martin Landis was taken to his home and in
his semiconscious condition he did not know that his
head with its handkerchief binding leaned against
the rascally breast of Lyman Mertzheimer.</p>

<a name="ch24"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXIV</h1>

<h2 align="center">&#8220;You Saved the Wrong One&#8221;</h2>

<p align="left">The news of the accident soon reached
the Reist farmhouse. Amanda telephoned her sympathy
to Mrs. Landis and asked if there was anything she
could do.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Amanda,&#8221; came the
reply, &#8220;I do wish you&#8217;d come over! You&#8217;re
such a comforting person to have around. Did you hear
that it was Lyman Mertzheimer helped to bring him
home? Lyman said he and Martin were walkin&#8217;
along the road and were so busy talkin&#8217; that
neither heard the car and it knocked Martin down.
It beats me what them two could have to talk about
so much in earnest that they wouldn&#8217;t hear the
automobile. But perhaps Lyman wanted to make up with
Martin for all the mean tricks he done to him a&#8217;ready.
Anyhow, we&#8217;re glad it ain&#8217;t worse. He&#8217;s
got a cut on the head and is pretty much bruised.
He&#8217;ll be stiff for a while but there ain&#8217;t
no bones broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad it isn&#8217;t worse.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, ain&#8217;t, abody still
has something to be thankful for? Then you&#8217;ll
come on over, Amanda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll be over.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As the girl walked down the road she
felt a strange mingling of emotions. She couldn&#8217;t
refuse the plea of Mrs. Landis, but one thing was
certain--she wouldn&#8217;t see Martin! He&#8217;d
be up-stairs and she could stay down. Perhaps she
could help with the work in the kitchen-- anything
but see Martin!</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Landis was excited as she drew
her visitor into the warm kitchen, but the excitement
was mingled with wrath. &#8220;What d&#8217;you think,
Amanda,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;our Mart---&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, our Mart---&#8221; piped
out one of the smaller children, but an older one
chided him, &#8220;Now you hush, and let Mom tell about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That Lyman Mertzheimer,&#8221;
said Mrs. Landis indignantly, &#8220;abody can&#8217;t
trust at all! He let me believe that he and Martin
was walkin&#8217; along friendly like and that&#8217;s
how Mart got hurt. But here after Lyman left and the
doctor had Mart all fixed up and was goin&#8217; he
told me that Martin was in the side of the road and
wouldn&#8217;t got hurt at all if he hadn&#8217;t
run to the middle to pull Lyman back. He saved that
mean fellow&#8217;s life and gets no thanks for it
from him! After all Lyman&#8217;s dirty tricks this
takes the cake!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda&#8217;s eyes sparkled. &#8220;He--I
think Martin&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; she said, her
lips trembling.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the mother agreed
as she wiped her eyes with one corner of her gingham
apron. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather my boy laid up in bed
hurt like he is than have him like Lyman.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Mom,&#8221; little Emma
came running into the room, &#8220;I looked in at Mart
and he&#8217;s awake. Mebbe he wants somebody to talk
to him like I did when I had the measles. Dare I go
set with him a little if I keep quiet?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Mrs. Landis,
&#8220;that would be a nice job for Amanda. You go
up,&#8221; she addressed the girl, &#8220;and stay
a little with him. He&#8217;ll appreciate your comin&#8217;
to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Amanda&#8217;s heart galloped. Her
whole being was a mass of contradictions. One second
she longed to fly up the steps to where the plumed
knight of her girlish dreams lay, the next she wanted
to flee down the country road away from him.</p>

<p align="left">She stood a moment, undecided, but
Mrs. Landis had taken her compliance for granted and
was already busy with some of her work in the kitchen.
At length Amanda turned to the stairs, followed by
several eager, excited children.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Here,&#8221; called the mother,
&#8220;Charlie, Emma, you just leave Amanda go up
alone. It ain&#8217;t good for Mart to have so much
company at once. I&#8217;ll leave you go up to-night.&#8221;
They turned reluctantly and the girl started up the
stairs alone, some power seeming to urge her on against
her will.</p>

<p align="left">Martin Landis returned to consciousness
through a shroud of enveloping shadows. What had happened?
Why was a strange man winding bandages round his head?
He raised an arm--it felt heavy. Then his mother&#8217;s
voice fell soothingly upon his ears, &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right, Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re all right,&#8221;
repeated the doctor, &#8220;but that other fellow
should have the bumps you got.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That other fellow"--Martin
thought hazily, then he remembered. The whole incident
came back to him, etched upon his memory. How he had
started from the car, eager to get to Amanda, then
Lyman had come with his news of her engagement and
the hope in his heart became stark. Where was her
blue bunting with its eternal song? Ah, he had killed
it with his indifference and caution and foolish blindness!
He knew he stumbled along the road, grief and misery
playing upon his heart strings. Then came the frantic
honk of the car and Lyman in its path. Good enough
for him, was the first thought of the Adam in Martin.
The next second he had obeyed some powerful impulse
and rushed to the help of the heedless Lyman. Then
blackness and oblivion had come upon him. Blessed
oblivion, he thought, as the details of the occurrence
returned to him. He groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt you?&#8221; asked the doctor kindly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;No. I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;
He smiled between his bandages. &#8220;I think I can
rest comfortably now, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He was grateful they left him alone
then, he wanted to think. Countless thoughts were
racing through his tortured brain. How could Amanda
marry Lyman Mertzheimer? Did she love him? Would he
make her happy? Why had he, Martin, been so blind?
What did life hold for him if Amanda went out of it?
The thoughts were maddening and after a while a merciful
Providence turned them away from him and he fell to
dreaming tenderly of the girl, the Amanda of his boyhood,
the gay, laughing comrade of his walks in the woods.
Tender, understanding Amanda of his hours of unhappiness--Amanda--the
vision of her danced before his eyes and lingered
by his side--Amanda---</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin"--the voice of her broke
in upon his dreaming! She stood in the doorway and
he wondered if that, too, was a part of his dream.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin,&#8221; she said again,
a little timidly. Then she came into the room, a familiar
little figure in her brown suit and little brown hat
pulled over her red hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hello,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;come
in if you care to.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I <i>am</i> in.&#8221; She
laughed nervously, a strange way for her to be laughing,
but the man did not take heed of it. Had she come to
laugh at him for being a fool? he thought.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he invited
coolly. She sat on the chair by his bed, her coat
buttoned and unbuttoned by her restless fingers as
she stole glances at the bandaged head of the man.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s good of you to come,&#8221;
he began. At that she turned and began to speak rapidly.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Martin, I must tell you! You
must let me tell you! I know what you did, how you
saved Lyman. I think it was wonderful of you, just
wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach.&#8221; He turned his flushed
face toward her then. &#8220;There&#8217;s noticing
wonderful about that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I think there is,&#8221; she
insisted, scarcely knowing what to say. She remembered
his old aversion to being lionized.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Tell me why you did it,&#8221;
she asked suddenly. She had to say something!</p>

<p align="left">The man lay silent for a moment, then
a rush of emotion, struggling for expression, swayed
him and he spoke, while his eyes were turned resolutely
from her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, Amanda!
I&#8217;ve been a fool not to recognize the fact long
ago that I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh!&#8221; There was a quick
cry from the girl. But the man went on, impelled by
the pain of losing her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I see now that I have always
loved you, even while I was infatuated by the other
girl. You were still you, right there when I needed
you, ready to give your comfort and help. I must have
loved you in the days we ran barefooted down the hills
and looked for flowers or birds. I&#8217;ve been asleep,
blind--call it what you will! Perhaps I could have
taught you to love me if I had read my own heart in
time. I took so much for granted, that you&#8217;d
always be right there for me--now I&#8217;ve found
out the truth too late. Lyman told me--I hope he&#8217;ll
make you happy. Perhaps you better go now. I&#8217;m
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p align="center"><a href="illus-3.png"><img src="illus-3.png"  alt="&#8220;What did Lyman tell you? I must know&#8221;" border="0" /></a><br />
&#8220;What did Lyman tell you? I must know&#8221;</p>

<p>But the request fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyman told you--just what did he tell you?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the man groaned.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a limit to human endurance. I
wish you&#8217;d go, dear, and leave me alone for
a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Lyman tell you?&#8221; she asked again.
&#8220;I must know.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of threshing
it over? It brings neither of us happiness. Of course
he told me about the engagement, that you are going
to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Another little cry,
not of joy this time, of anger, rather. There was
silence then for a space, while the man turned his
face to the wall and the girl tried to still the beating
of her heart and control herself sufficiently to be
able to speak.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Then, Martin,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;you saved Lyman for me, because you thought
I loved him?&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted a protesting hand as if pleading for silence.</p>

<p>She went on haltingly, &#8220;Why, Martin, you saved
the wrong one!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He raised his head from the pillow
then; a strangling sound came from his lips.</p>

<p align="left">The girl&#8217;s face burned with
blushes but her eyes looked fearlessly into his as
she said again, &#8220;You saved the wrong one. Why,
Martin--Martin-- if you wanted to save the man I love--you--you
should have saved yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">He read the truth in her eyes; his
arms reached out for her then and her lips moved to
his as steel to a magnet.</p>

<p align="left">When he spoke she marveled at the
tenderness in his voice; she never dreamed, even in
her brightest romantic dreams, that a man&#8217;s voice
could hold so much tenderness. &#8220;Amanda, I began
to read my own heart that day you found me in the
woods and helped and comforted me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Martin,&#8221; she pressed
her lips upon his bandaged head, her eyes were glowing
with that &#8220;light that never was on land or sea"--"Oh,
Martin, I&#8217;ve loved <i>you</i> ever since that
day you saved my life by throwing me into the bean-patch
and then kissed my burnt hand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not your hand this time, sweetheart,&#8221;
he whispered, &#8220;your lips!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; Amanda
said after they had told each other the old, old story,
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I kept my castles in Spain.
When you went away and didn&#8217;t write I almost
wrecked them purposely. I thought they&#8217;d go
tumbling into ashes but somehow I braced them up again.
Now they&#8217;re more beautiful than ever. I pity
the people who own no castles in Spain, who have no
dreams that won&#8217;t come true exactly as they dreamed.
I&#8217;ll hold on to my dreams even if I know they
can never come true exactly as I dream them. I wouldn&#8217;t
give up my castles in Spain. I&#8217;ll have them
till I die. But, Martin, that automobile might have
killed you!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Nonsense. I&#8217;m just scratched
a bit. I&#8217;ll be out of this in no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That rascal of a Lyman--you thought I could
marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe it, yet he said so.
Some liar, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, but not quite so black
as you thought. He is going to marry a girl named
Amanda, one from his college town, and they are going
to live in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good riddance!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes. The engagement was announced
last week while you were away. He knew you had probably
not heard of it and saw a chance to make you jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to wring his
neck,&#8221; said Martin, grinning. &#8220;But since
it turned out like this for me I&#8217;ll forgive
him. I don&#8217;t care how many Amandas he marries
if he leaves me mine.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">At that point little Charlie, tiptoeing
to the open door of Martin&#8217;s room, saw something
which caused him to widen his eyes, clap a hand over
his mouth to smother an exclamation, and turn quickly
down the stairs.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Jiminy pats, Mom!&#8221; he
cried excitedly as he entered the kitchen, &#8220;our
Mart&#8217;s holdin&#8217; Amanda&#8217;s hand and
she&#8217;s kissin&#8217; him on the face! I seen
it and heard it! Jiminy pats!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The small boy wondered what ailed
his mother, why she was not properly shocked. Why
did she gather him into her arms and whisper something
that sounded exactly like, &#8220;Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
she told him. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t tell; that&#8217;s
their secret.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, is it all right? Then I
won&#8217;t tell. Mart says I can keep a secret good.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">But Martin and Amanda decided to take
the mother into the happy secret. &#8220;Look at my
face,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hide
my happiness. We might as well tell it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mother!&#8221; Martin&#8217;s
voice rang through the house. At the sound a happy,
white-capped woman wiped her eyes again on the corner
of her gingham apron and mounted the stairs to give
her blessing to her boy and the girl who had crowned
him with her woman&#8217;s love.</p>

<p align="left">The announcement of the troth was
received with gladness at the Reist farmhouse. Mrs.
Reist was happy in her daughter&#8217;s joy and lived
again in memory that hour when the same miracle had
been wrought for her.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say,&#8221; asked Philip, &#8220;I
hope you two don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re springing
a surprise? A person blind in one eye and not seeing
out of the other could see which way the wind was
blowing.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, Phil!&#8221; Amanda replied,
but there was only love in her voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It must be nice to be so happy
like you are,&#8221; said Millie.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, it must be,&#8221; Uncle
Amos nodded his head in affirmation. He looked at
the hired girl, who did not appear to notice him. &#8220;I
just wish I was twenty years younger,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p align="left">A week later Amanda and Martin were
sitting in one of the big rooms of the Reist farmhouse.
Through the open door came the sound of Millie and
Mrs. Reist in conversation, with an occasional deeper
note in Uncle Amos&#8217;s slow, contented voice.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Martin,
&#8220;I was never much of a hand to remember poetry,
but there&#8217;s one verse I read at school that keeps
coming to me since I know you are going to marry me.
That verse about</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8217;A perfect woman, nobly planned<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To warn, to comfort, and command.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, no, Martin! You put me
on a pedestal, and that&#8217;s a tottering bit of
architecture.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Not on a pedestal,&#8221; he
contradicted, &#8220;but right by my side, walking
together, that&#8217;s the way we want to go.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way.
It&#8217;s the way my parents went and the way yours
are still going.&#8221; She rose and brought to him
a little book. &#8220;Read Riley&#8217;s &#8216;Song
of the Road,&#8217;&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>He opened the book and read the musical verses:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;&#8217;O I will walk with you,
my lad, whichever way you fare,<br>
&#160;&#160;You&#8217;ll have me, too, the side o&#8217;
you, with heart as light as air.<br>
&#160;&#160;No care for where the road you take&#8217;s
a-leadin&#8217;--anywhere,--<br>
&#160;&#160;It can but be a joyful ja&#8217;nt the
whilst <i>you</i> journey there.<br>
&#160;&#160;The road you take&#8217;s the path o&#8217;
love, an&#8217; that&#8217;s the bridth o&#8217; two--<br>
&#160;&#160;An&#8217; I will walk with you, my lad--O
I will walk with you.&#8217;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;that&#8217;s
beautiful! Riley knew how to put into words the things
we all feel but can&#8217;t express. Let&#8217;s read
the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Her voice blended with his and out
in the adjoining room Millie heard and listened. Silently
the hired girl walked to the open door. She watched
the two heads bending over the little book. Her heart
ached for the happy childhood and the romance she
had missed. The closing words of the poem came distinctly
to her;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;&#8217;Sure, I will walk with you,
my lad,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As love ordains me to,--<br>
&#160;&#160;To Heaven&#8217;s door, and through, my
lad,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O I will walk with you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say,&#8221; she startled the
lovers by her remark, &#8220;if that ain&#8217;t the
prettiest piece I ever heard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think so?&#8221; said Martin kindly. &#8220;I
agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it sounds nice but the meanin&#8217; is
what abody likes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">The hired girl went back to her place
in the other room. But Amanda turned to the man beside
her and said, &#8220;Romance in the heart of Millie!
Who would guess it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;There&#8217;s romance everywhere,&#8221;
Martin told her. &#8220;Millie&#8217;s heart wouldn&#8217;t
be the fine big thing it is if she didn&#8217;t keep
a space there for love and romance.&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch25"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXV</h1>

<h2 align="center">The Heart of Millie</h2>

<p align="left">The Reist farmhouse, always a busy
place, was soon rivaling the proverbial beehive. Mrs.
Reist, to whom sentiment was ever a vital, holy thing,
to be treasured and clung to throughout the years,
had long ago, in Amanda&#8217;s childhood, begun the
preparation for the time of the girl&#8217;s marriage.
After the fashion of olden times the mother had begun
the filling of a Hope Chest for her girl. Just as she
instilled into the youthful mind the homely old-fashioned
virtues of honesty, truthfulness and reverence for
holy things which made Amanda, as she stood on the
threshold of a new life, so richly dowered in spiritual
and moral acquisitions, so had the mother laid away
in the big wooden chest fine linens, useful and beautiful
and symbolic of the worth of the bride whose home
they were destined to enrich.</p>

<p align="left">But in addition to the precious contents
of the Hope Chest many things were needed for the
dowry of the daughter of a prosperous Lancaster County
family. So the evenings and Saturdays of that year
became busy ones for Amanda. Millie helped with much
of the plainer sewing and Mrs. Reist&#8217;s exquisite
tiny stitches enhanced many of the garments.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Poor Aunt Rebecca,&#8221; Amanda
said one day, &#8220;how we miss her now!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, ain&#8217;t?&#8221; agreed
Millie. &#8220;For all her scoldin&#8217; she was a
good help still. If she was livin&#8217; yet she&#8217;d
fuss about all the sewin&#8217; you&#8217;re doin&#8217;
to get married but she&#8217;d pitch right in and help
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Philip offered to pull basting threads,
but his generosity was not appreciated. &#8220;Go
on,&#8221; Millie told him, &#8220;you&#8217;d be more
bother than you&#8217;re worth! Next you&#8217;d be
pullin&#8217; out the sewin&#8217;!&#8221; He was frequently
chased from the room because of his inappropriate remarks
concerning the trousseau or his declaration that Amanda
was spending all the family wealth by her reckless
substitution of silk for muslin.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You keep quiet,&#8221; Millie
often reproved him. &#8220;I guess Amanda dare have
what she wants if your mom says so. If she wants them
things she calls cammysoles made out of silk let her
have &#8216;em. She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; married
only once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he
asked teasingly. &#8220;Say, Millie, I thought a camisole
is a dish you make rice pudding in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, that shows you don&#8217;t
know everything yet, even if you do go to Lancaster
to school!&#8221; And he was driven from the room in
laughing defeat.</p>

<p align="left">It is usually conceded that to the
prospective bride belongs the privilege of naming
the day of her marriage, but it seemed to Amanda that
Millie and Philip had as much to do with it as she.
Each one had a favorite month. Phil&#8217;s suggestion
finally decided the month. &#8220;Sis, you&#8217;re
so keen about flowers, why don&#8217;t you make it
a spring wedding? About cherry blossom time would
be the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would. We could have it in the orchard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On a nice rainy day in May,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pessimist! It doesn&#8217;t rain every day
in May!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">There followed happy, excited times
when the matter of a house was discussed. Those were
wonderful hours in which the two hunted a nest that
would be near enough to the city for Martin&#8217;s
daily commuting and yet have so much of the country
about it as to boast of green grass and space for
flowers. It was found at length, a little new bungalow
outside the city limits in a residential section where
gardens and trees beautified the entire street.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Mrs. Reist
said to Uncle Amos one day, &#8220;there&#8217;s another
little house for sale in that street. If it wasn&#8217;t
for breakin&#8217; up the home for you and Millie
I&#8217;d buy it and Philip and I could move in there.
It would be nice and handy for him. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
tired of such a big house. There I could do the work
myself. There&#8217;d be room for you to come with
us, but I wouldn&#8217;t need Millie. I don&#8217;t
like to send her off to some other people. We had
her so long a&#8217;ready, and she&#8217;s a good,
faithful worker. Ach, I guess I&#8217;ll have to give
up thinkin&#8217; about doin&#8217; anything like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, well, now let me think
once.&#8221; Uncle Amos scratched his head. Then an
inscrutable smile touched his lips. &#8220;Well, now,&#8221;
he said after a moment&#8217;s meditation, &#8220;now
I don&#8217;t see why it can&#8217;t be arranged some
way. There&#8217;s more&#8217;n one way sometimes to
do things. I don&#8217;t know--I don&#8217;t know--but
I think I can see a way we could manage that-- providin&#8217;--ach,
we&#8217;ll just wait once, mebbe it&#8217;ll come
out right.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist looked at her brother.
What did he mean? He stammered and smiled like a foolish
schoolboy. Poor Amos, she thought, how hard he had
worked all his life and how little pleasure he had
seemed to get out of his days! He was growing old,
too, and would soon be unable to do the work on a
big farm.</p>

<p align="left">But Uncle Amos seemed spry enough
several days later when he and Millie entered the
big market wagon to go to Lancaster with the farm products.
They left the Reist farmhouse early in the morning,
a cold, gray winter day.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Say, Millie,&#8221; he said
soon after they began the drive, &#8220;I want to talk
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered dryly,
&#8220;what&#8217;s to keep you from doin&#8217; so?
Here I am. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Millie, now don&#8217;t
get obstreperous! Manda&#8217;s mom would like to
sell the farm and move to Lancaster to a little house.
Then she wouldn&#8217;t need me nor you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Are you sure, Amos?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Sure! She told me herself.
That would leave us out a home. For I don&#8217;t
want to live in no city and set down evenings and look
at houses or trolley cars. You can hire out to some
other people, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, yea! Amos. What in the
world--I don&#8217;t want to live no place else.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, now, wait once, Millie.
I got a plan all fixed up, something I wished long
a&#8217;ready I could do, only I hated to bust up the
farm for my sister. Millie--ach, don&#8217;t you know
what I mean? Let&#8217;s me and you get married!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Millie drew her heavy blanket shawl
closer around her and pulled her black woolen cap
farther over her forehead, then she turned and looked
at Amos, but his face was in shadow; the feeble oil
lamp of the market wagon sent scant light inside.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Now, Amos, you say that just
because you take pity for me and want to fix a home
for me, ain&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, yammer, no!&#8221; came
the vehement reply. &#8220;I liked you long a&#8217;ready,
Millie, and used to think still, &#8216;There&#8217;s
a girl I&#8217;d like to marry!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Why, Amos,&#8221; came the
happy answer, &#8220;and I liked you, too, long a&#8217;ready!
I used to think still to myself, &#8217;I don&#8217;t
guess I&#8217;ll ever get married but if I do I&#8217;d
like a man like Amos.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Then Uncle Amos suddenly demonstrated
his skill at driving one-handed and something more
than the blanket-shawl was around Millie&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, my,&#8221; she said after
a while, &#8220;to think of it--me, a hired girl,
to get a nice, good man like you for husband!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;And me, a fat dopple of a farmer
to get a girl like you! I&#8217;ll be good to you,
Millie, honest! You just see once if I won&#8217;t!
You needn&#8217;t work so hard no more. I&#8217;ll
buy the farm off my sister and we&#8217;ll sell some
of the land and stop this goin&#8217; to market. It&#8217;s
too hard work. We can take it easier; we&#8217;re
both gettin&#8217; old, ain&#8217;t, Millie?&#8221;
He leaned over and kissed her again.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said blissfully,
&#8220;I used to think still this here kissin&#8217;
business is all soft mush, but--why--I think it&#8217;s
all right. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; she laughed as
she pushed his face away gently. &#8220;They say still
there ain&#8217;t no fools like old ones. I guess we&#8217;re
some.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;All right, we don&#8217;t care,
long as we like it. Here,&#8221; he spoke to the horse,
&#8220;giddap with you! Abody&#8217;d think you was
restin&#8217; &#8216;stead of goin&#8217; to market.
We&#8217;ll be late for sure this morning.&#8221; His
mittened hands flapped the reins and the horse quickened
his steps.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ha, ha,&#8221; the man laughed,
&#8220;I know what ails old Bill! The kissin&#8217;
scared him. He never heard none before in this market
wagon. No wonder he stands still. Here&#8217;s another
for good measure.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, Amos, I think that&#8217;s
often enough now! Anyhow for this morning once.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ha, ha,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Millie, you&#8217;re all right! That&#8217;s
what you are!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">That evening at supper Philip asked
suddenly, &#8220;What ails you two, Uncle Amos, you
and Millie? I see you grin every time you look at each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, nothin&#8217; ails me
except a bad case of love that&#8217;s been stickin&#8217;
in me this long while and now it&#8217;s broke out.
Millie&#8217;s caught it too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; Amanda
was quick to detect his meaning. &#8220;You two darlings!
I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach,&#8221; the hired girl
said, blushing rosy, &#8220;don&#8217;t go make so
much fuss about it. Ain&#8217;t we old enough to get
married?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Millie,&#8221;
Mrs. Reist told her. &#8220;Amos just needs a wife
like you. He worried me long a&#8217;ready, goin&#8217;
on all alone. Now I know he&#8217;ll have some one
to look out for him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Finis! You&#8217;re done for!&#8221;
Phil said. &#8220;Lay down your arms and surrender.
But say, that makes it bully for Mother and me. We
can move to Lancaster now. May we run out to the farm
and visit you, Millie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Don&#8217;t ask me. It&#8217;s Amos&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Millie, you goose,&#8221; the
man said happily, &#8220;when you marry me everything
I have will be yours, too.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, did I ever! I don&#8217;t
believe I&#8217;ll know how to think about it that
way. This nice big house won&#8217;t seem like part
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be <i>ours</i>&#8221; Uncle Amos
said, smiling at the word.</p>

<p align="left">And so it happened that the preparation
of another wedding outfit was begun in the Reist farmhouse.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t need fancy things
like Amanda,&#8221; declared the hired girl. &#8220;I
wear the old style o&#8217; clothes yet. And for top
things, why, I made up my mind I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to wear myself plain and be a Mennonite.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Plain,&#8221; said Mrs. Reist.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t Amos be glad! He likes you no matter
what clothes you wear, but it&#8217;s so much nicer
when you can both go to the same church. He&#8217;ll
be glad if you turn a Mennonite.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to be one. So I won&#8217;t want much for my weddin&#8217;
in clothes, just some plain suits and bonnets and
shawl. But I got no chest ready like Amanda has. I
never thought I&#8217;d need a Hope Chest. When I
was little I got knocked around, but as soon as I could
earn money I saved a little all the time and now I
got a pretty good bit laid in the bank. I can take
that and get me some things I need.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Reist laid her hands on the shoulders
of the faithful hired girl. &#8220;Never mind, Millie,
you&#8217;ll have your chest! We&#8217;ll go to Lancaster
and buy what you want. Amos got his share of our mother&#8217;s
things when we divided them and he has a big chest
on the garret all filled with homespun linen and quilts
and things that you can use. That will all be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Mine? I can&#8217;t hardly
believe it. You couldn&#8217;t be nicer to me if you
was my own mom. And I ain&#8217;t forgettin&#8217;
it neither! I said to Amos we won&#8217;t get married
till after Amanda and when you and Phil are all fixed
in your new house. Then we&#8217;ll go to the preacher
and get it done. We don&#8217;t want no fuss, just
so we get married, that&#8217;s all we want. It needn&#8217;t
be done fancy.&#8221;</p>

<a name="ch26"></a>
<h1 align="center">CHAPTER XXVI</h1>

<h2 align="center">&#8220;One Heart Made o&#8217; Two&#8221;</h2>

<p align="left">Amanda married Martin that May, when
the cherry blossoms transformed the orchard into a
sea of white.</p>

<p align="left">To the rear of the farmhouse stood
a plot of ground planted with cherry trees. Low grass
under the trees and little paths worn into it led like
aisles up and down. There, near the centre of the plot,
Amanda and Martin chose the place for the ceremony.
The march to and from that spot would lead through
a white-arched aisle sweet with the breath of thousands
of cherry blossoms.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda selected for her wedding a
dress of white silk. &#8220;I do want a wedding dress
I can pack away in an old box on the attic and keep
for fifty years and take out and look at when it&#8217;s
yellow and old,&#8221; she said, romance still burning
in her heart.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Uh,&#8221; said practical Millie.
&#8220;Why, there ain&#8217;t no attic in that house
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to! Them bungalows ain&#8217;t
the kind I like. I like a real house.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no garret
like ours, but there is a little raftered room with
a slanting ceiling and little windows and I intend
to put trunks and boxes in it and take my spinning-wheel
that Granny gave me and put it there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;A spinning-wheel! What under
the sun will you do with that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Look at it,&#8221; was the
strange reply, at which Millie shook her head and
went off to her work.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Are you going to carry flowers,
and have a real wedding?&#8221; Philip asked his sister
the day before the wedding.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;I don&#8217;t need any, with
the whole outdoors a mass of bloom. If the pink moccasins
were blooming I&#8217;d carry some.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Pink--with your red hair!&#8221;
The boy exercised his brotherly prerogative of frankness.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, pink! Whose wedding is
this? I&#8217;d carry pink moccasins and wear my red
hair if they--if the two curdled! But I&#8217;ll have
to find some other wild flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll help you pick them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin and I are going for them, thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mention it!
I wouldn&#8217;t spoil that party!&#8221; He began
whistling his old greeting whistle. He had forgotten
it for several years but some chord of memory flashed
it back to him at that moment.</p>

<p align="left">At the sound of the old melody Amanda
stepped closer to the boy. &#8220;Phil,&#8221; she
said tenderly, &#8220;you make me awful mad sometimes
but I like you a lot. I hope you&#8217;ll be as happy
as I am some day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he blinked, half
ashamed of any outward show of emotion. &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right, Sis. When I find a girl like you I&#8217;ll
do the wedding ring stunt, too. Now, since we&#8217;ve
thrown bouquets at each other let&#8217;s get to work.
What may I do if I&#8217;m debarred from the flower
hunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ask Millie.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Gee, Sis, have a heart! She&#8217;s
been love struck, too. Regular epidemic at Reists&#8217;!&#8221;
But he went off to offer his services to the hired
girl.</p>

<p align="left">As Amanda dressed in her white silk
gown she wished she were beautiful. &#8220;Every girl
ought to have beauty once in her life,&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;Even for just one hour on her wedding day it
would be a boon. But then, love is supposed to be
blind, so perhaps Martin will think I am beautiful
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">She was not beautiful, but her eyes
shone soft and her face was expressive of the joy
in her heart as she stood ready for the ceremony which
was the consummation of her love for the knight of
her girlhood&#8217;s dreams.</p>

<p align="left">It would be impossible to find a more
beautiful setting for a wedding than the Reist cherry
orchard that May day. There were rows of trees, with
their fresh young green and their canopies of lacy
bloom through which the warm May sunshine trickled
like gold. As Amanda and Martin stood before the waiting
clergyman and in the presence of relatives, friends
and neighbors, faint breezes stirred the branches and
fugitive little petals loosened from the hearts of
the blossoms and fell upon the happy people gathered
under the white glory of the orchard.</p>

<p align="left">Several robins with nests already
built on broad crotches of the cherry trees hovered
about, their black eyes peering questioningly down
at the unwonted visitors to the place. Once during
the marriage service a Baltimore oriole flashed into
a tree near by, his golden plumage made more intense
against the white blossoms. With proud assurance he
demonstrated his appreciation of the orchard and perched
fearlessly on an outer bough while he whistled his
insistent, imperious, &#8220;Here, here, come here!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">As the words, &#8220;Until death do
us part"--the old, inadequate mortal expression for
love that is deathless--sounded in that white-arched
temple Amanda thought of Riley&#8217;s &#8220;Song
of the Road&#8221; and its</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;To Heaven&#8217;s door, and <i>through</i>,
my lad,<br>
&#160;&#160;O I will walk with you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">After the ceremony the strains of
a Wedding March fell upon the ears of the people gathered
in the orchard.</p>

<p align="left">Amanda&#8217;s lips parted in pleasure.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Phil&#8217;s work!&#8221; she cried
and ran behind the clump of bushes from where the
music seemed to come. Philip was stooping to grind
the motor of Landis&#8217;s Victrola.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, you dear!&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t I though!&#8221;
he said frivolously. &#8220;I had the heck of a time
getting this thing here while you were dressing and
keeping it hidden. I had to bribe little Charlie twice
to keep him from telling you. He was so sure you&#8217;d
want to know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s just the last touch
we needed to make this perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Leave it to your devoted brother.
Now go back and receive the best wishes or congratulations
or whatever it is they give the bride.&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">Later there was supper out under the
trees. A supper at which Millie, trim in her new gray
Mennonite garb and white cap, was able to show her
affection for the bride, but at which the bride was
so riotously happy that she scarcely knew what she
was eating.</p>

<p align="left">Of course there was a real bride&#8217;s
cake with white icing. Amanda had to cut it and hand
out pieces for the young people to dream upon.</p>

<p align="left">After a while the bride slipped away,
took off her white dress and put on a dark suit. Then
she and Martin dodged rice and were whirled away in
a big automobile.</p>

<p align="left">The other members of the household
had much to occupy their hands for the next hour,
setting things to rights, as Millie said, the while
their hearts and thoughts were speeding after the two
who had smiled and looked as though no other mortals
had ever known such love.</p>

<p align="left">When the place was once more in order
and the Landis family, the last guests, had gone off
in the darkness, the children flinging back loud good-nights,
Mrs. Reist, Philip, Millie and Uncle Amos sat alone
on the porch and talked things over.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;It was some wedding, Mother,&#8221;
was the opinion of the boy.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;Prettiest
thing I ever seen,&#8221; said the hired girl.</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Yes, so it was,&#8221; Uncle
Amos agreed. &#8220;But say, Millie, it&#8217;s dandy
and moonlight. What d&#8217;you say to a little walk
down the road? Or are you too tired?&#8221;</p>

<p align="left">&#8220;Ach, I&#8217;m not tired.&#8221;
And the two went off in the soft spring night for
a stroll along the lane, Millie in her gray Mennonite
dress, Uncle Amos in his plain suit of the faith.
The two on the porch saw her homely face transfigured
by a smile as she looked up into the countenance of
the man who had brought romance into her life, then
they saw Uncle Amos draw the hand of Millie through
his arm and in that fashion they walked along in the
moonlight, the man, contented and happy, holding the
hand of the woman warmly in his grasp. To them, no
less than to the youthful lovers, was given the promise
of happiness and in their hearts was ringing Amanda&#8217;s
and Martin&#8217;s pledge:</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#8220;Sure, I will walk with you, my
lad,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As love ordains me to,--<br>
&#160;&#160;To Heaven&#8217;s door, and <i>through</i>,
my lad,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O I will walk with you.&#8221;

This file should be named mndmn10h.htm or mndmn10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, mndmn11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, mndmn10a.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
