<H4 align=center>PROGRESS</H4>

<P>INTRODUCTORY : Freedom and Progress intimately connected&mdash; Confidence in Progress, a marked feature of the earlier half of the nineteenth century, was bound up with confidence in Science and Reason, and in a belief in determinism, either natural or divine&mdash;Condorcet, Saint-Simon, Comte and others proclaim Progress as a dogma.</P>

<OL type=I>

	<LI>The idea of progress in Vacherot, Tame and Renan&mdash;Interesting reflections of Renan based on belief in Reason.</LI>

	<LI>Cournot and Renouvier regard Progress in a different light, owing to their ideas on Freedom&mdash;They look upon it as a possibility only, but not assured, not inevitable&mdash;Renouvier's study of history in relation to progress and his view of immortality as Progress&mdash;No law of progress exists.</LI>

	<LI>The new spiritualist group emphasise the lack of any law of progress, by their insistence on the spontaneity of the spirit, creativeness and contingency&mdash;Difficulties of finalsm or teleology in relation to progress as free&mdash;No law or guarantee of progress.</LI>

</OL>

<P>CONCLUSION : Complete change from earlier period regarding Progress&mdash; New view of it developed&mdash;Facile optimism rejected.</P>
