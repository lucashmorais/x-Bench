<center><b>CRITICAL INTRODUCTION.</b></center>

<p>The preparation of the series of works published under the
general title "Geology of the Voyage of the 'Beagle'" occupied a
great part of Darwin's time during the ten years that followed his
return to England. The second volume of the series, entitled
"Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands, with Brief Notices on
the Geology of Australia and the Cape of Good Hope," made its
appearance in 1844. The materials for this volume were collected in
part during the outward voyage, when the <i>Beagle</i> called at
St. Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands, and St. Paul's Rocks, and at
Fernando Noronha, but mainly during the homeward cruise; then it
was that the Galapagos Islands were surveyed, the Low Archipelago
passed through, and Tahiti visited; after making calls at the Bay
of Islands, in New Zealand, and also at Sydney, Hobart Town and
King George's Sound in Australia, the <i>Beagle</i> sailed across
the Indian Ocean to the little group of the Keeling or Cocos
Islands, which Darwin has rendered famous by his observations, and
thence to Mauritius; calling at the Cape of Good Hope on her way,
the ship then proceeded successively to St. Helena and Ascension,
and revisited the Cape de Verde Islands before finally reaching
England.</p>

<p>Although Darwin was thus able to gratify his curiosity by visits
to a great number of very interesting volcanic districts, the
voyage opened for him with a bitter disappointment. He had been
reading Humboldt's "Personal Narrative" during his last year's
residence in Cambridge, and had copied out from it long passages
about Teneriffe. He was actually making inquiries as to the best
means of visiting that island, when the offer was made to him to
accompany Captain Fitzroy in the <i>Beagle.</i> His friend Henslow
too, on parting with him, had given him the advice to procure and
read the recently published first volume of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 158">page 158</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Principles of Geology," though he warned him against accepting
the views advocated by its author. During the time the <i>
Beagle</i> was beating backwards and forwards when the voyage
commenced, Darwin, although hardly ever able to leave his berth,
was employing all the opportunities which the terrible sea-sickness
left him, in studying Humboldt and Lyell. We may therefore form an
idea of his feelings when, on the ship reaching Santa Cruz, and the
Peak of Teneriffe making its appearance among the clouds, they were
suddenly informed that an outbreak of cholera would prevent any
landing!</p>

<p>Ample compensation for this disappointment was found, however,
when the ship reached Porta Praya in St. Jago, the largest of the
Cape de Verde Islands. Here he spent three most delightful weeks,
and really commenced his work as a geologist and naturalist.
Writing to his father he says, "Geologising in a volcanic country
is most delightful; besides the interest attached to itself, it
leads you into most beautiful and retired spots. Nobody but a
person fond of Natural History can imagine the pleasure of
strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and
coffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this
island, that has given me so much instruction and delight, is
reckoned the most uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch
at during our voyage. It certainly is generally very barren, but
the valleys are more exquisitely beautiful, from the very contrast.
It is utterly useless to say anything about the scenery; it would
be as profitable to explain to a blind man colours, as to a person
who has not been out of Europe, the total dissimilarity of a
tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I always look forward to
writing it down, either in my log-book (which increases in bulk),
or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and those raptures
badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing wonderfully,
and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo home."</p>

<p>The indelible impression made on Darwin's mind by this first
visit to a volcanic island, is borne witness to by a remarkable
passage in the "Autobiography" written by him in 1876. "The geology
of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple; a stream of lava formerly
flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent shells
and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since then
the whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock
revealed to me a new and important fact, namely that there had been
afterwards subsidence round the craters which had</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 159">page 159</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>since been in action, and had poured forth lava. It then first
dawned on me that I might perhaps write a book on the geology of
the various countries visited, and this made me thrill with
delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly I can
call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with the
sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near and with
living corals in the tidal pools at my feet."</p>

<p>Only five years before, when listening to poor Professor
Jameson's lectures on the effete Wernerianism, which at that time
did duty for geological teaching, Darwin had found them "incredibly
dull," and he declared that "the sole effect they produced on me
was a determination never so long as I lived to read a book on
Geology, or in any way to study the science."</p>

<p>What a contrast we find in the expressions which he makes use of
in referring to Geological Science, in his letters written home
from the <i>Beagle</i>! After alluding to the delight of collecting
and studying marine animals, he exclaims, "But Geology carries the
day!" Writing to Henslow he says, "I am quite charmed with Geology,
but, like the wise animal between two bundles of hay, I do not know
which to like best; the old crystalline group of rocks, or the
softer and more fossiliferous beds." And just as the long voyage is
about to come to a close he again writes, "I find in Geology a
never-failing interest; as it has been remarked, it creates the
same grand ideas respecting this world which Astronomy does for the
Universe." In this passage Darwin doubtless refers to a remark of
Sir John Herschel's in his admirable "Preliminary Discourse on the
Study of Natural Philosophy,"&mdash;a book which exercised a most
remarkable and beneficial influence on the mind of the young
naturalist.</p>

<p>If there cannot be any doubt as to the strong predilection in
Darwin's mind for geological studies, both during and after the
memorable voyage, there is equally little difficulty in perceiving
the school of geological thought which, in spite of the warnings of
Sedgwick and Henslow, had obtained complete ascendancy over his
mind. He writes in 1876: "The very first place which I examined,
namely St. Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands, showed me clearly the
wonderful superiority of Lyell's manner of treating Geology,
compared with that of any other author, whose works I had with me,
or ever afterwards read." And again, "The science of Geology is
enormously indebted to Lyell&mdash;more so, as I believe, than to
any other man who ever lived . . . I am proud to remember that the
first place, namely, St. Jago, in the Cape de</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 160">page 160</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verde Archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the
infinite superiority of Lyell's views over those advocated in any
other work known to me."</p>

<p>The passages I have cited will serve to show the spirit in which
Darwin entered upon his geological studies, and the perusal of the
following pages will furnish abundant proofs of the enthusiasm,
acumen, and caution with which his researches were pursued.</p>

<p>Large collections of rocks and minerals were made by Darwin
during his researches, and sent home to Cambridge, to be kept under
the care of his faithful friend Henslow. After visiting his
relations and friends, Darwin's first care on his return to England
was to unpack and examine these collections. He accordingly, at the
end of 1836, took lodgings for three months in Fitzwilliam Street,
Cambridge, so as to be near Henslow; and in studying and
determining his geological specimens received much valuable aid
from the eminent crystallographer and mineralogist, Professor
William Hallows Miller.</p>

<p>The actual writing of the volume upon volcanic islands was not
commenced till 1843, when Darwin had settled in the spot which
became his home for the rest of his life&mdash;the famous house at
Down, in Kent. Writing to his friend Mr. Fox, on March 28th, 1843,
he says, "I am very slowly progressing with a volume, or rather
pamphlet, on the volcanic islands which we visited: I manage only a
couple of hours per day, and that not very regularly. It is uphill
work writing books, which cost money in publishing, and which are
not read even by geologists."</p>

<p>The work occupied Darwin during the whole of the year 1843, and
was issued in the spring of the following year, the actual time
engaged in preparing it being recorded in his diary as "from the
summer of 1842 to January 1844;" but the author does not appear to
have been by any means satisfied with the result when the book was
finished. He wrote to Lyell, "You have pleased me much by saying
that you intend looking through my 'Volcanic Islands;' it cost me
eighteen months!!! and I have heard of very few who have read it.
Now I shall feel, whatever little (and little it is) there is
confirmatory of old work, or new, will work its effect and not be
lost." To Sir Joseph Hooker he wrote, "I have just finished a
little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited. I do not
know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I hope you will
let me send you a copy."</p>

<p>Every geologist knows how full of interest and suggestiveness
is</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 161">page 161</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>this book of Darwin's on volcanic islands. Probably the scant
satisfaction which its author seemed to find in it may be traced to
the effect of a contrast which he felt between the memory of
glowing delights he had experienced when, hammer in hand, he roamed
over new and interesting scenes, and the slow, laborious, and less
congenial task of re-writing and arranging his notes in
book-form.</p>

<p>In 1874, in writing an account of the ancient volcanoes of the
Hebrides, I had frequent occasion to quote Mr. Darwin's
observations on the Atlantic volcanoes, in illustration of the
phenomena exhibited by the relics of still older volcanoes in our
own islands. Darwin, in writing to his old friend Sir Charles Lyell
upon the subject, says, "I was not a little pleased to see my
volcanic book quoted, for I thought it was completely dead and
forgotten."</p>

<p>Two years later the original publishers of this book and of that
on South America proposed to re-issue them. Darwin at first
hesitated, for he seemed to think there could be little of abiding
interest in them; he consulted me upon the subject in one of the
conversations which I used to have with him at that time, and I
strongly urged upon him the reprint of the works. I was much
gratified when he gave way upon the point, and consented to their
appearing just as originally issued. In his preface he says, "Owing
to the great progress which Geology has made in recent times, my
views on some few points may be somewhat antiquated, but I have
thought it best to leave them as they originally appeared."</p>

<p>It may be interesting to indicate, as briefly as possible, the
chief geological problem upon which the publication of Darwin's
"Volcanic Islands" threw new and important light. The merit of the
work consisted in supplying interesting observations, which in some
cases have proved of crucial value in exploding prevalent
fallacies; in calling attention to phenomena and considerations
that had been quite overlooked by geologists, but have since
exercised an important influence in moulding geological
speculation; and lastly in showing the importance which attaches to
small and seemingly insignificant causes, some of which afford a
key to the explanation of very curious geological problems.</p>

<p>Visiting as he did the districts in which Von Buch and others
had found what they thought to be evidence of the truth of
"Elevation-craters," Darwin was able to show that the facts were
capable of a totally different interpretation. The views originally
put forward by the old German geologist and traveller, and
almost</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 162">page 162</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>universally accepted by his countrymen, had met with much
support from Elie de Beaumont and Dufrenoy, the leaders of
geological thought in France. They were, however, stoutly opposed
by Scrope and Lyell in this country, and by Constant Prevost and
Virlet on the other side of the channel. Darwin, in the work before
us, shows how little ground there is for the assumption that the
great ring-craters of the Atlantic islands have originated in
gigantic blisters of the earth's surface which, opening at the top,
have given origin to the craters. Admitting the influence of the
injection of lava into the structure of the volcanic cones, in
increasing their bulk and elevation, he shows that, in the main,
the volcanoes are built up by repeated ejections causing an
accumulation of materials around the vent.</p>

<p>While, however, agreeing on the whole with Scrope and Lyell, as
to the explosive origin of ordinary volcanic craters, Darwin
clearly saw that, in some cases, great craters might be formed or
enlarged, by the subsidence of the floors after eruptions. The
importance of this agency, to which too little attention has been
directed by geologists, has recently been shown by Professor Dana,
in his admirable work on Kilauea and the other great volcanoes of
the Hawaiian Archipelago.</p>

<p>The effects of subsidence at a volcanic centre in producing a
downward dip of the strata around it, was first pointed out by
Darwin, as the result of his earliest work in the Cape de Verde
Islands. Striking illustrations of the same principle have since
been pointed out by M. Robert and others in Iceland, by Mr. Heaphy
in New Zealand, and by myself in the Western Isles of Scotland.</p>

Darwin again and again called attention to the evidence that
volcanic vents exhibit relations to one another which can only be
explained by assuming the existence of lines of fissure in the
earth's crust, along which the lavas have made their way to the
surface. But he, at the same time, clearly saw that there was no
evidence of the occurrence of great deluges of lava along such
fissures; he showed how the most remarkable plateaux, composed of
successive lava sheets, might be built up by repeated and moderate
ejections from numerous isolated vents; and he expressly insists
upon the rapidity with which the cinder-cones around the orifices
of ejection and the evidences of successive outflows of lava would
be obliterated by denudation.<br>
<br>
 

<p>One of the most striking parts of the book is that in which he
deals with the effects of denudation in producing "basal
wrecks"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 163">page 163</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>or worn down stumps of volcanoes. He was enabled to examine a
series of cases in which could be traced every gradation, from
perfect volcanic cones down to the solidified plugs which had
consolidated in the vents from which ejections had taken place.
Darwin's observations on these points have been of the greatest
value and assistance to all who have essayed to study the effects
of volcanic action during earlier periods of the earth's history.
Like Lyell, he was firmly persuaded of the continuity of geological
history, and ever delighted in finding indications, in the present
order of nature, that the phenomena of the past could be accounted
for by means of causes which are still in operation. Lyell's last
work in the field was carried on about his home in Forfarshire, and
only a few months before his death he wrote to Darwin: "All the
work which I have done has confirmed me in the belief that the only
difference between Pal&aelig;ozoic and recent volcanic rocks is no
more than we must allow for, by the enormous time to which the
products of the oldest volcanoes have been subjected to chemical
changes."</p>

<p>Darwin was greatly impressed, as the result of his studies of
volcanic phenomena, followed by an examination of the great
granite-masses of the Andes, with the relations between the
so-called Plutonic rocks and those of undoubtedly volcanic origin.
It was indeed a fortunate circumstance, that after studying some
excellent examples of recent volcanic rocks, he proceeded to
examine in South America many fine illustrations of the older
igneous rock-masses, and especially of the most highly crystalline
types of the same, and then on his way home had opportunities of
reviving the impression made upon him by the fresh and unaltered
volcanic rocks. Some of the general considerations suggested by
these observations were discussed in a paper read by him before the
Geological Society, on March 7th, 1838, under the title "On the
Connection of Certain Volcanic Phenomena, and On the Formation of
Mountain-chains, and the Effect of Continental Elevations." The
exact bearing of these two classes of facts upon one another are
more fully discussed in his book on South American geology.</p>

<p>The proofs of recent elevation around many of the volcanic
islands led Darwin to conclude that volcanic areas were, as a rule,
regions in which upward movements were taking place, and he was
naturally led to contrast them with the areas in which, as he
showed, the occurrence of atolls, encircling reefs, and
barrier-reefs afford indication of subsidence. In this way he was
able to</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 164">page 164</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>map out the oceanic areas in different zones, along which
opposite kinds of movement were taking place. His conclusions on
this subject were full of novelty and suggestiveness.</p>

Very clearly did Darwin recognise the importance of the fact that
most of the oceanic islands appear to be of volcanic origin, though
he was careful to point out the remarkable exceptions which
somewhat invalidate the generalisation. In his "Origin of Species"
he has elaborated the idea and suggested the theory of the
permanence of ocean-basins, a suggestion which has been adopted and
pushed farther by subsequent authors, than we think its originator
would have approved. His caution and fairness of mind on this and
similar speculative questions was well-known to all who were in the
habit of discussing them with him.<br>
<br>
 

<p>Some years before the voyage of the <i>Beagle,</i> Mr. Poulett
Scrope had pointed out the remarkable analogies that exist between
certain igneous rocks of banded structure, as seen in the Ponza
Islands, and the foliated crystalline schists. It does not appear
that Darwin was acquainted with this remarkable memoir, but quite
independently he called attention to the same phenomena when he
came to study some very similar rocks which occur in the island of
Ascension. Coming fresh from the study of the great masses of
crystalline schist in the South American continent, he was struck
by the circumstance that in the undoubtedly igneous rocks of
Ascension we find a similar separation of the constituent minerals
along parallel "folia." These observations led Darwin to the same
conclusion as that arrived at some time before by
Scrope&mdash;namely that when crystallisation takes place in rock
masses under the influence of great deforming stresses, a
separation and parallel arrangement of the constituent minerals
will result. This is a process which is now fully recognised as
having been a potent factor in the production of the metamorphic
rock, and has been called by more recent writers
"dynamo-metamorphism."</p>

<p>In this, and in many similar discussions, in which exact
mineralogical knowledge was required, it is remarkable how
successful Darwin was in making out the true facts with regard to
the rocks he studied by the simple aid of a penknife and
pocket-lens, supplemented by a few chemical tests and the constant
use of the blowpipe. Since his day, the method of study of rocks by
thin sections under the microscope has been devised, and has become
a most efficient aid in all petrographical inquiries. During the
voyage of H.M.S. <i>Challenger,</i> many of the islands studied

<p>Darwin have been revisited and their rocks collected. The
results of their study by one of the greatest masters of the
science of micropetrography&mdash;Professor Renard of
Brussels&mdash;have been recently published in one of the volumes
of "Reports on the <i>Challenger</i> Expedition." While much that
is new and valuable has been contributed to geological science by
these more recent investigations, and many changes have been made
in nomenclature and other points of detail, it is interesting to
find that all the chief facts described by Darwin and his friend
Professor Miller have stood the test of time and further study, and
remain as a monument of the acumen and accuracy in minute
observation of these pioneers in geological research.</p>

ST. JAGO, IN THE CAPE DE VERDE ARCHIPELAGO.</b></center>

<p class="intro">Rocks of the lowest series.&mdash;A calcareous
sedimentary deposit, with recent shells, altered by the contact of
superincumbent lava, its horizontality and extent.&mdash;Subsequent
volcanic eruptions, associated with calcareous matter in an earthy
and fibrous form, and often enclosed within the separate cells of
the scori&aelig;.&mdash;Ancient and obliterated orifices of
eruption of small size. Difficulty of tracing over a bare plain
recent streams of lava.&mdash;Inland hills of more ancient volcanic
rock.&mdash;Decomposed olivine in large masses. Feldspathic rocks
beneath the upper crystalline basaltic strata. Uniform structure
and form of the more ancient volcanic hills.&mdash;Form of the
valleys near the coast. Conglomerate now forming on the sea
beach.</p>

<p>The island of St. Jago extends in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction,
thirty miles in length by about twelve in breadth. My observations,
made during two visits, were confined to the southern portion
within the distance of a few leagues from Porto Praya. The country,
viewed from the sea, presents a varied outline: smooth conical
hills of a reddish colour (like Red Hill in Fig. 1<sup>1</sup>) and
others less regular, flat-topped, and of a blackish colour (like A,
B, C,) rise from successive, step-formed plains of lava. At a
distance, a chain of mountains, many thousand feet in height,
traverses the interior of the island. There is no active volcano in
St. Jago, and only one in the group, namely at Fogo. The island
since being inhabited has not suffered from destructive
earthquakes.</p>

<p>The lowest rocks exposed on the coast near Porto Praya, are
highly crystalline and compact; they appear to be of ancient,
submarine, volcanic origin; they are unconformably covered by a
thin, irregular, calcareous deposit, abounding with shells of a
late tertiary period; and this again is capped by a wide sheet of
basaltic lava, which has flowed in successive streams from the
interior of the island, between the square-topped hills marked A,
B, C, etc. Still more recent streams of lava have been erupted from
the scattered cones, such as Red and Signal Post Hills. The upper
strata of the square-topped hills are</p>

<p><i>Mineralogical description of the rocks of the lowest
series.</i>&mdash;These rocks possess an extremely varying
character; they consist of black, brown, and grey, compact,
basaltic bases, with numerous crystals of augite, hornblende,
olivine, mica, and sometimes glassy feldspar. A common variety is
almost entirely composed of crystals of augite with olivine. Mica,
it is known, seldom occurs where augite abounds; nor probably does
the present case offer a real exception, for the mica (at least in
my best characterised specimen, in which one nodule of this mineral
is nearly half an inch in length) is as perfectly rounded as a
pebble in a conglomerate, and evidently has not been crystallised
in the base, in which it is now enclosed, but has proceeded from
the fusion of some pre-existing rock. These compact lavas alternate
with tuffs, amygdaloids, and wacke, and in some places with coarse
conglomerate. Some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green
colour, others, pale yellowish-green, and others nearly white; I
was surprised to find that some of the latter varieties, even where
whitest, fused into a jet black enamel, whilst some of the green
varieties afforded only a pale gray bead. Numerous dikes,
consisting chiefly of highly compact augitic rocks, and of gray
amygdaloidal varieties, intersect the strata, which have in several
places been dislocated with considerable violence, and thrown into
highly inclined positions. One line of disturbance crosses the
northern end of Quail Island (an islet in the Bay of Porto Praya),
and can be followed to the mainland. These disturbances took place
before the deposition of the recent sedimentary bed; and the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 169">page 169</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>surface, also, had previously been denuded to a great extent, as
is shown by many truncated dikes.</p>

<p><i>Description of the calcareous deposit overlying the foregoing
volcanic rocks.</i>&mdash;This stratum is very conspicuous from its
white colour, and from the extreme regularity with which it ranges
in a horizontal line for some miles along the coast. Its average
height above the sea, measured from the upper line of junction with
the superincumbent basaltic lava, is about sixty feet; and its
thickness, although varying much from the inequalities of the
underlying formation, may be estimated at about twenty feet. It
consists of quite white calcareous matter, partly composed of
organic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, and partly of a substance which may
be aptly compared in appearance with mortar. Fragments of rock and
pebbles are scattered throughout this bed, often forming,
especially in the lower part, a conglomerate. Many of the fragments
of rock are whitewashed with a thin coating of calcareous matter.
At Quail Island, the calcareous deposit is replaced in its lowest
part by a soft, brown, earthy tuff, full of Turritell&aelig;; this
is covered by a bed of pebbles, passing into sandstone, and mixed
with fragments of echini, claws of crabs, and shells; the
oyster-shells still adhering to the rock on which they grew.
Numerous white balls appearing like pisolitic concretions, from the
size of a walnut to that of an apple, are embedded in this deposit;
they usually have a small pebble in their centres. Although so like
concretions, a close examination convinced me that they were
Nullipor&aelig;, retaining their proper forms, but with their
surfaces slightly abraded: these bodies (plants as they are now
generally considered to be) exhibit under a microscope of ordinary
power, no traces of organisation in their internal structure. Mr.
George R. Sowerby has been so good as to examine the shells which I
collected: there are fourteen species in a sufficiently perfect
condition for their characters to be made out with some degree of
certainty, and four which can be referred only to their genera. Of
the fourteen shells, of which a list is given in the Appendix,
eleven are recent species; one, though undescribed, is perhaps
identical with a species which I found living in the harbour of
Porto Praya; the two remaining species are unknown, and have been
described by Mr. Sowerby. Until the shells of this Archipelago and
of the neighbouring coasts are better known, it would be rash to
assert that even these two latter shells are extinct. The number of
species which certainly belong to existing kinds, although few in
number, are sufficient to show that the deposit belongs to a late
tertiary period. From its mineralogical character, from the number
and size of the embedded fragments, and from the abundance of
Patell&aelig;, and other littoral shells, it is evident that the
whole was accumulated in a shallow sea, near an ancient
coast-line.</p>

<p><i>Effects produced by the flowing of the superincumbent
basaltic lava over the calcareous deposit.</i>&mdash;These effects
are very curious. The calcareous matter is altered to the depth of
about a foot beneath the line of junction; and a most perfect
gradation can be traced, from loosely aggregated, small, particles
of shells, corallines, and Nullipor&aelig;, into a rock, in which
not a trace of mechanical origin can be discovered,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 170">page 170</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>even with a microscope. Where the metamorphic change has been
greatest, two varieties occur. The first is a hard, compact, white,
fine-grained rock, striped with a few parallel lines of black
volcanic particles, and resembling a sandstone, but which, upon
close examination, is seen to be crystallised throughout, with the
cleavages so perfect that they can be readily measured by the
reflecting goniometer. In specimens, where the change has been less
complete, when moistened and examined under a strong lens, the most
interesting gradation can be traced, some of the rounded particles
retaining their proper forms, and others insensibly melting into
the granulo-crystalline paste. The weathered surface of this stone,
as is so frequently the case with ordinary limestones, assumes a
brick-red colour.</p>

<p>The second metamorphosed variety is likewise a hard rock, but
without any crystalline structure. It consists of a white, opaque,
compact, calcareous stone, thickly mottled with rounded, though
regular, spots of a soft, earthy, ochraceous substance. This earthy
matter is of a pale yellowish-brown colour, and appears to be a
mixture of carbonate of lime with iron; it effervesces with acids,
is infusible, but blackens under the blowpipe, and becomes
magnetic. The rounded form of the minute patches of earthy
substance, and the steps in the progress of their perfect
formation, which can be followed in a suit of specimens, clearly
show that they are due either to some power of aggregation in the
earthy particles amongst themselves, or more probably to a strong
attraction between the atoms of the carbonate of line, and
consequently to the segregation of the earthy extraneous matter. I
was much interested by this fact, because I have often seen quartz
rocks (for instance, in the Falkland Islands, and in the lower
Silurian strata of the Stiper-stones in Shropshire), mottled in a
precisely analogous manner, with little spots of a white, earthy
substance (earthy feldspar?); and these rocks, there was good
reason to suppose, had undergone the action of heat,&mdash;a view
which thus receives confirmation. This spotted structure may
possibly afford some indication in distinguishing those formations
of quartz, which owe their present structure to igneous action,
from those produced by the agency of water alone; a source of
doubt, which I should think from my own experience, that most
geologists, when examining arenaceo-quartzose districts must have
experienced.</p>

<p>The lowest and most scoriaceous part of the lava, in rolling
over the sedimentary deposit at the bottom of the sea, has caught
up large quantities of calcareous matter, which now forms a
snow-white, highly crystalline basis to a breccia, including small
pieces of black, glossy scori&aelig;. A little above this, where
the lime is less abundant, and the lava more compact, numerous
little balls, composed of spicula of calcareous spar, radiating
from common centres, occupy the interstices. In one part of Quail
Island, the lime has thus been crystallised by the heat of the
superincumbent lava, where it is only thirteen feet in thickness;
nor had the lava been originally thicker, and since reduced by
degradation, as could be told from the degree of cellularity of its
surface. I have already observed that the sea must have been
shallow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 171">page 171</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>in which the calcareous deposit was accumulated. In this case,
therefore, the carbonic acid gas has been retained under a
pressure, insignificant compared with that (a column of water,
1,708 feet in height) originally supposed by Sir James Hall to be
requisite for this end: but since his experiments, it has been
discovered that pressure has less to do with the retention of
carbonic acid gas, than the nature of the circumjacent atmosphere;
and hence, as is stated to be the case by Mr. Faraday, masses of
limestone are sometimes fused and crystallised even in common
limekilns.<sup>1</sup> Carbonate of lime can be heated to almost
any degree, according to Faraday, in an atmosphere of carbonic acid
gas, without being decomposed; and Gay-Lussac found that fragments
of limestone, placed in a tube and heated to a degree, not
sufficient by itself to cause their decomposition, yet immediately
evolved their carbonic acid, when a stream of common air or steam
was passed over them: Gay-Lussac attributes this to the mechanical
displacement of the nascent carbonic acid gas. The calcareous
matter beneath the lava, and especially that forming the
crystalline spicula between the interstices of the scori&aelig;,
although heated in an atmosphere probably composed chiefly of
steam, could not have been subjected to the effects of a passing
stream; and hence it is, perhaps, that they have retained their
carbonic acid, under a small amount of pressure.</p>

<p>The fragments of scori&aelig;, embedded in the crystalline
calcareous basis, are of a jet black colour, with a glossy fracture
like pitchstone. Their surfaces, however, are coated with a layer
of a reddish-orange, translucent substance, which can easily be
scratched with a knife; hence they appear as if overlaid by a thin
layer of rosin. Some of the smaller fragments are partially changed
throughout into this substance: a change which appears quite
different from ordinary decomposition. At the Galapagos Archipelago
(as will be described in a future chapter), great beds are formed
of volcanic ashes and particles of scori&aelig;, which have
undergone a closely similar change.</p>

<p><i>The extent and horizontality of the calcareous
stratum.</i>&mdash;The upper line of surface of the calcareous
stratum, which is so conspicuous from being quite white and so
nearly horizontal, ranges for miles along the coast, at the height
of about sixty feet above the sea. The sheet of basalt, by which it
is capped, is on an average eighty feet in thickness. Westward of
Porto Praya beyond Red Hill, the white stratum with the
superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams.
Northward of Signal Post Hill, I could follow it with my eye,
trending away for several miles along the sea cliffs. The distance
thus observed is about seven miles; but I cannot doubt from its
regularity that it extends much farther. In some ravines at right
angles to the coast, it is seen gently dipping towards the sea,
probably with the same inclination</p>

having given me the following references to papers on this subject:

<p>as when deposited round the ancient shores of the island. I
found only one inland section, namely, at the base of the hill
marked A, where, at the height of some hundred feet, this bed was
exposed; it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock
associated with wacke, and was covered by the widespread sheet of
modern basaltic lava. Some exceptions occur to the horizontality of
the white stratum: at Quail Island, its upper surface is only forty
feet above the level of the sea; here also the capping of lava is
only between twelve and fifteen feet in thickness; on the other
hand, at the north-east side of Porto Praya harbour, the calcareous
stratum, as well as the rock on which it rests, attain a height
above the average level: the inequality of level in these two cases
is not, as I believe, owing to unequal elevation, but to original
irregularities at the bottom of the sea. Of this fact, at Quail
Island, there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit being in
one part of much greater than the average thickness, and in another
part being entirely absent; in this latter case, the modern
basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin.</p>

<br>
A&mdash;Ancient volcanic rocks. &nbsp;B&mdash;Calcareous stratum.
&nbsp;C&mdash;Upper balastic lava.</p>

<p>Under Signal Post Hill, the white stratum dips into the sea in a
remarkable manner. This hill is conical, 450 feet in height, and
retains some traces of having had a crateriform structure; it is
composed chiefly of matter erupted posteriorly to the elevation of
the great basaltic plain, but partly of lava of apparently
submarine origin and of considerable antiquity. The surrounding
plain, as well as the eastern flank of this hill, has been worn
into steep precipices, overhanging the sea. In these precipices,
the white calcareous stratum may be seen, at the height of about
seventy feet above the beach, running for some miles both northward
and southward of the hill, in a line appearing to be perfectly
horizontal; but for a space of a quarter of a mile directly under
the hill, it dips into the sea and disappears. On the south side
the dip is gradual, on the north side it is more abrupt, as is
shown in Fig. 2. As neither the calcareous stratum, nor the
superincumbent basaltic lava (as far as the latter can be
distinguished from the more modern ejections), appears to thicken
as it dips, I infer that these strata were not originally
accumulated in a trough, the centre of which afterwards became a
point of eruption; but that they have subsequently been disturbed
and bent. We may suppose either that Signal Post Hill subsided
after its elevation with the surrounding country, or that it never
was uplifted to the same height with it. This latter seems to me
the most probable alternative, for during the slow and equable
elevation of this portion of the island, the subterranean
motive</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 173">page 173</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>power, from expending part of its force in repeatedly erupting
volcanic matter from beneath this point, would, it is likely, have
less force to uplift it. Something of the same kind seems to have
occurred near Red Hill, for when tracing upwards the naked streams
of lava from near Porto Praya towards the interior of the island, I
was strongly induced to suspect, that since the lava had flowed,
the slope of the land had been slightly modified, either by a small
subsidence near Red Hill, or by that portion of the plain having
been uplifted to a less height during the elevation of the whole
area.</p>

<p><i>The basaltic lava, superincumbent on the calcareous
deposit.</i>&mdash;This lava is of a pale grey colour, fusing into
a black enamel; its fracture is rather earthy and concretionary; it
contains olivine in small grains. The central parts of the mass are
compact, or at most crenulated with a few minute cavities, and are
often columnar. At Quail Island this structure was assumed in a
striking manner; the lava in one part being divided into horizontal
lamin&aelig;, which became in another part split by vertical
fissures into five-sided plates; and these again, being piled on
each other, insensibly became soldered together, forming fine
symmetrical columns. The lower surface of the lava is vesicular,
but sometimes only to the thickness of a few inches; the upper
surface, which is likewise vesicular, is divided into balls,
frequently as much as three feet in diameter, made up of concentric
layers. The mass is composed of more than one stream; its total
thickness being, on an average, about eighty feet: the lower
portion has certainly flowed beneath the sea, and probably likewise
the upper portion. The chief part of this lava has flowed from the
central districts, between the hills marked A, B, C, etc., in the
woodcut-map. The surface of the country, near the coast, is level
and barren; towards the interior, the land rises by successive
terraces, of which four, when viewed from a distance, could be
distinctly counted.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic eruptions subsequent to the elevation of the
coastland; the ejected matter associated with earthy
lime.</i>&mdash;These recent lavas have proceeded from those
scattered, conical, reddish-coloured hills, which rise abruptly
from the plain-country near the coast. I ascended some of them, but
will describe only one, namely, <i>Red Hill</i>, which may serve as
a type of its class, and is remarkable in some especial respects.
Its height is about six hundred feet; it is composed of bright red,
highly scoriaceous rock of a basaltic nature; on one side of its
summit there is a hollow, probably the last remnant of a crater.
Several of the other hills of this class, judging from their
external forms, are surmounted by much more perfect craters. When
sailing along the coast, it was evident that a considerable body of
lava had flowed from Red Hill, over a line of cliff about one
hundred and twenty feet in height, into the sea: this line of cliff
is continuous with that forming the coast, and bounding the plain
on both sides of this hill; these streams, therefore, were erupted,
after the formation of the coast-cliffs, from Red Hill, when it
must have stood, as it now does, above the level of the sea. This
conclusion accords with the highly scoriaceous condition of all the
rock on it, appearing to be of subaerial formation: and this is</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 174">page 174</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>important, as there are some beds of calcareous matter near its
summit, which might, at a hasty glance, have been mistaken for a
submarine deposit. These beds consist of white, earthy, carbonate
of lime, extremely friable so as to be crushed with the least
pressure; the most compact specimens not resisting the strength of
the fingers. Some of the masses are as white as quicklime, and
appear absolutely pure; but on examining them with a lens, minute
particles of scori&aelig; can always be seen, and I could find none
which, when dissolved in acids, did not leave a residue of this
nature. It is, moreover, difficult to find a particle of the lime
which does not change colour under the blowpipe, most of them even
becoming glazed. The scoriaceous fragments and the calcareous
matter are associated in the most irregular manner, sometimes in
obscure beds, but more generally as a confused breccia, the lime in
some parts and the scori&aelig; in others being most abundant. Sir
H. De la Beche has been so kind as to have some of the purest
specimens analysed, with a view to discover, considering their
volcanic origin, whether they contained much magnesia; but only a
small portion was found, such as is present in most limestones.</p>

<p>Fragments of the scori&aelig; embedded in the calcareous mass,
when broken, exhibit many of their cells lined and partly filled
with a white, delicate, excessively fragile, moss-like, or rather
conferva-like, reticulation of carbonate of lime. These fibres,
examined under a lens of one-tenth of an inch focal distance,
appear cylindrical; they are rather above one-thousandth of an inch
in diameter; they are either simply branched, or more commonly
united into an irregular mass of network, with the meshes of very
unequal sizes and of unequal numbers of sides. Some of the fibres
are thickly covered with extremely minute spicula, occasionally
aggregated into little tuffs; and hence they have a hairy
appearance. These spicula are of the same diameter throughout their
length; they are easily detached, so that the object-glass of the
microscope soon becomes scattered over with them. Within the cells
of many fragments of the scoria, the lime exhibits this fibrous
structure, but generally in a less perfect degree. These cells do
not appear to be connected with one another. There can be no doubt,
as will presently be shown, that the lime was erupted, mingled with
the lava in its fluid state, and therefore I have thought it worth
while to describe minutely this curious fibrous structure, of which
I know nothing analogous. From the earthy condition of the fibres,
this structure does not appear to be related to
crystallisation.</p>

<p>Other fragments of the scoriaceous rock from this hill, when
broken, are often seen marked with short and irregular white
streaks, which are owing to a row of separate cells being partly,
or quite, filled with white calcareous powder. This structure
immediately reminded me of the appearance in badly kneaded dough,
of balls and drawn-out streaks of flour, which have remained
unmixed with the paste; and I cannot doubt that small masses of the
lime, in the same manner remaining unmixed with the fluid lava,
have been drawn out when the whole was in motion. I carefully
examined, by trituration and solution in acids, pieces of the
scori&aelig;, taken from within half-an-inch of those</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 175">page 175</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>cells which were filled with the calcareous powder, and they did
not contain an atom of free lime. It is obvious that the lava and
lime have on a large scale been very imperfectly mingled; and where
small portions of the lime have been entangled within a piece of
the viscid lava, the cause of their now occupying, in the form of a
powder or of a fibrous reticulation, the vesicular cavities, is, I
think, evidently due to the confined gases having most readily
expanded at the points where the incoherent lime rendered the lava
less adhesive.</p>

<p>A mile eastward of the town of Praya, there is a steep-sided
gorge, about one hundred and fifty yards in width, cutting through
the basaltic plain and underlying beds, but since filled up by a
stream of more modern lava. This lava is dark grey, and in most
parts compact and rudely columnar; but at a little distance from
the coast, it includes in an irregular manner a brecciated mass of
red scori&aelig; mingled with a considerable quantity of white,
friable, and in some parts, nearly pure earthy lime, like that on
the summit of Red Hill. This lava, with its entangled lime, has
certainly flowed in the form of a regular stream; and, judging from
the shape of the gorge, towards which the drainage of the country
(feeble though it now be) still is directed, and from the
appearance of the bed of loose water-worn blocks with their
interstices unfilled, like those in the bed of a torrent, on which
the lava rests, we may conclude that the stream was of subaerial
origin. I was unable to trace it to its source, but, from its
direction, it seemed to have come from Signal Post Hill, distant
one mile and a quarter, which, like Red Hill, has been a point of
eruption subsequent to the elevation of the great basaltic plain.
It accords with this view, that I found on Signal Post Hill, a mass
of earthy, calcareous matter of the same nature, mingled with
scori&aelig;. I may here observe that part of the calcareous matter
forming the horizontal sedimentary bed, especially the finer matter
with which the embedded fragments of rock are whitewashed, has
probably been derived from similar volcanic eruptions, as well as
from triturated organic remains: the underlying, ancient,
crystalline rocks, also, are associated with much carbonate of
lime, filling amygdaloidal cavities, and forming irregular masses,
the nature of which latter I was unable to understand.</p>

<p>Considering the abundance of earthy lime near the summit of Red
Hill, a volcanic cone six hundred feet in height, of subaerial
growth,&mdash;considering the intimate manner in which minute
particles and large masses of scori&aelig; are embedded in the
masses of nearly pure lime, and on the other hand, the manner in
which small kernels and streaks of the calcareous powder are
included in solid pieces of the scori&aelig;,&mdash;considering,
also, the similar occurrence of lime and scori&aelig; within a
stream of lava, also supposed, with good reason, to have been of
modern subaerial origin, and to have flowed from a hill, where
earthy lime also occurs: I think, considering these facts, there
can be no doubt that the lime has been erupted, mingled with the
molten lava. I am not aware that any similar case has been
described: it appears to me an interesting one, inasmuch as most
geologists must have speculated on the probable effects of a
volcanic focus, bursting through deep-seated beds</p>

<p>of different mineralogical composition. The great abundance of
free silex in the trachytes of some countries (as described by
Beudant in Hungary, and by P. Scrope in the Panza Islands), perhaps
solves the inquiry with respect to deep-seated beds of quartz; and
we probably here see it answered, where the volcanic action has
invaded subjacent masses of limestone. One is naturally led to
conjecture in what state the now earthy carbonate of lime existed,
when ejected with the intensely heated lava: from the extreme
cellularity of the scori&aelig; on Red Hill, the pressure cannot
have been great, and as most volcanic eruptions are accompanied by
the emission of large quantities of steam and other gases, we here
have the most favourable conditions, according to the views at
present entertained by chemists, for the expulsion of the carbonic
acid.<sup>1</sup> Has the slow re-absorption of this gas, it may be
asked, given to the lime in the cells of the lava, that peculiar
fibrous structure, like that of an efflorescing salt? Finally, I
may remark on the great contrast in appearance between this earthy
lime, which must have been heated in a free atmosphere of steam and
other gases, while the white, crystalline, calcareous spar,
produced by a single thin sheet of lava (as at Quail Island)
rolling over similar earthy lime and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
organic remains, at the bottom of a shallow sea.</p>

<p><i>Signal Post Hill.</i>&mdash;This hill has already been
several times mentioned, especially with reference to the
remarkable manner in which the white calcareous stratum, in other
parts so horizontal (<a href="#page 172">Fig. 2</a>), dips under it
into the sea. It has a broad summit, with obscure traces of a
crateriform structure, and is composed of basaltic
rocks,<sup>2</sup> some compact, others highly cellular with
inclined beds of loose scori&aelig;, of which some are associated
with earthy lime. Like Red Hill, it has been the source of
eruptions, subsequently to the elevation of the surrounding
basaltic plain; but unlike that hill, it has undergone considerable
denudation, and has been the seat of volcanic action at a remote
period, when beneath the sea. I judge of this latter circumstance
from finding on its inland flank the last remnants of three
small</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Whilst deep beneath the surface, the carbonate
of lime was, I presume, in a fluid state. Hutton, it is known,
thought that all amygdaloids were produced by drops of molten
limestone floating in the trap, like oil in water: this no doubt is
erroneous, but if the matter forming the summit of Red Hill had
been cooled under the pressure of a moderately deep sea, or within
the walls of a dike, we should, in all probability, have had a trap
rock associated with large masses of compact, crystalline,
calcareous spar, which, according to the views entertained by many
geologists, would have been wrongly attributed to subsequent
infiltration.<br>
2. Of these, one common variety is remarkable for being full of
small fragments of a dark jasper-red earthy mineral, which, when
examined carefully, shows an indistinct cleavage; the little
fragments are elongated in form, are soft, are magnetic before and
after being heated, and fuse with difficulty into a dull enamel.
This mineral is evidently closely related to the oxides of iron,
but I cannot ascertain what it exactly is. The rock containing this
mineral is crenulated with small angular cavities, which are lined
and filled with yellowish crystals of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 177">page 177</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>points of eruption. These points are composed of glossy
scori&aelig;, cemented by crystalline calcareous spar, exactly like
the great submarine calcareous deposit, where the heated lava has
rolled over it: their demolished state can, I think, be explained
only by the denuding action of the waves of the sea. I was guided
to the first orifice by observing a sheet of lava, about two
hundred yards square, with steepish sides, superimposed on the
basaltic plain with no adjoining hillock, whence it could have been
erupted; and the only trace of a crater which I was able to
discover, consisted of some inclined beds of scori&aelig; at one of
its corners. At the distance of fifty yards from a second
level-topped patch of lava, but of much smaller size, I found an
irregular circular group of masses of cemented, scoriaceous
breccia, about six feet in height, which doubtless had once formed
the point of eruption. The third orifice is now marked only by an
irregular circle of cemented scori&aelig;, about four yards in
diameter, and rising in its highest point scarcely three feet above
the level of the plain, the surface of which, close all round,
exhibits its usual appearance: here we have a horizontal basal
section of a volcanic spiracle, which, together with all its
ejected matter, has been almost totally obliterated.</p>

<p>The stream of lava, which fills the narrow gorge<sup>1</sup>
eastward of the town of Praya, judging from its course, seems, as
before remarked, to have come from Signal Post Hill, and to have
flowed over the plain, after its elevation: the same observation
applies to a stream (possibly part of the same one) capping the sea
cliffs, a little eastward of the gorge. When I endeavoured to
follow these streams over the stony level plain, which is almost
destitute of soil and vegetation, I was much surprised to find,
that although composed of hard basaltic matter, and not having been
exposed to marine denudation, all distant traces of them soon
became utterly lost. But I have since observed at the Galapagos
Archipelago, that it is often impossible to follow even great
deluges of quite recent lava across older streams, except by the
size of the bushes growing on them, or by the comparative states of
glossiness of their surfaces,&mdash;characters which a short lapse
of time would be sufficient quite to obscure. I may remark, that in
a level country, with a dry climate, and with the wind blowing
always in one direction (as at the Cape de Verde Archipelago), the
effects of atmospheric degradation are probably much greater than
would at first be expected; for soil in this case accumulates only
in a few protected hollows, and being blown in one direction, it is
always travelling towards the sea in the form of the finest dust,
leaving the surface of the rocks bare, and exposed to the full
effects of renewed meteoric action.</p>

<p><i>Inland hills of more ancient volcanic rocks.</i>&mdash;These
hills are laid down by eye, and marked as A, B, C, etc., in <a
href="#page 168">Map 1.</a> They are related in mineralogical
composition, and are probably directly</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The sides of this gorge, where the upper
basaltic stratum is intersected, are almost perpendicular. The
lava, which has since filled it up, is attached to these sides,
almost as firmly as a dike is to its walls. In most cases, where a
stream of lava has flowed down a valley, it is bounded on each side
by loose scoriaceous masses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 178">page 178</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>continuous with the lowest rocks exposed on the coast. These
hills, viewed from a distance, appear as if they had once formed
part of an irregular tableland, and from their corresponding
structure and composition this probably has been the case. They
have flat, slightly inclined summits, and are, on an average, about
six hundred feet in height; they present their steepest slope
towards the interior of the island, from which point they radiate
outwards, and are separated from each other by broad and deep
valleys, through which the great streams of lava, forming the
coast-plains, have descended. Their inner and steeper escarpments
are ranged in an irregular curve, which rudely follows the line of
the shore, two or three miles inland from it. I ascended a few of
these hills, and from others, which I was able to examine with a
telescope, I obtained specimens, through the kindness of Mr. Kent,
the assistant-surgeon of the <i>Beagle</i>; although by these means
I am acquainted with only a part of the range, five or six miles in
length, yet I scarcely hesitate, from their uniform structure, to
affirm that they are parts of one great formation, stretching round
much of the circumference of the island.</p>

<p>The upper and lower strata of these hills differ greatly in
composition. The upper are basaltic, generally compact, but
sometimes scoriaceous and amygdaloidal, with associated masses of
wacke: where the basalt is compact, it is either fine-grained or
very coarsely crystallised; in the latter case it passes into an
augitic rock, containing much olivine; the olivine is either
colourless, or of the usual yellow and dull reddish shades. On some
of the hills, beds of calcareous matter, both in an earthy and in a
crystalline form, including fragments of glossy scori&aelig;, are
associated with the basaltic strata. These strata differ from the
streams of basaltic lava forming the coast-plains, only in being
more compact, and in the crystals of augite, and in the grains of
olivine being of much greater size;&mdash;characters which,
together with the appearance of the associated calcareous beds,
induce me to believe that they are of submarine formation.</p>

<p>Some considerable masses of wacke, which are associated with
these basaltic strata, and which likewise occur in the basal series
on the coast, especially at Quail Island, are curious. They consist
of a pale yellowish- green argillaceous substance, of a crumbling
texture when dry, but unctuous when moist: in its purest form, it
is of a beautiful green tint, with translucent edges, and
occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage. Under the
blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark grey, and sometimes even
black bead, which is slightly magnetic. From these characters, I
naturally thought that it was one of the pale species, decomposed,
of the genus augite;&mdash;a conclusion supported by the unaltered
rock being full of large separate crystals of black augite, and of
balls and irregular streaks of dark grey augitic rock. As the
basalt ordinarily consists of augite, and of olivine often
tarnished and of a dull red colour, I was led to examine the stages
of decomposition of this latter mineral, and I found, to my
surprise, that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from
unaltered olivine to the green wacke. Part of the same grain under
the blowpipe would in some instances</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 179">page 179</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>behave like olivine, its colour being only slightly changed, and
part would give a black magnetic bead. Hence I can have no doubt
that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine; but great
chemical changes must have been effected during the act of
decomposition thus to have altered a very hard, transparent,
infusible mineral, into a soft, unctuous, easily melted,
argillaceous substance.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The basal strata of these hills, as well as some neighbouring,
separate, bare, rounded hillocks, consist of compact, fine-grained,
non-crystalline (or so slightly as scarcely to be perceptible),
ferruginous, feldspathic rocks, and generally in a state of
semi-decomposition. Their fracture is exceedingly irregular, and
splintery; yet small fragments are often very tough. They contain
much ferruginous matter, either in the form of minute grains with a
metallic lustre, or of brown hair-like threads: the rock in this
latter case assuming a pseudo-brecciated structure. These rocks
sometimes contain mica and veins of agate. Their rusty brown or
yellowish colour is partly due to the oxides of iron, but chiefly
to innumerable, microscopically minute, black specks, which, when a
fragment is heated, are easily fused, and evidently are either
hornblende or augite. These rocks, therefore, although at first
appearing like baked clay or some altered sedimentary deposit,
contain all the essential ingredients of trachyte; from which they
differ only in not being harsh, and in not containing crystals of
glassy feldspar. As is so often the case with trachytic formation,
no stratification is here apparent. A person would not readily
believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava; yet at St.
Helena there are well-characterised streams (as will be described
in an ensuing chapter) of nearly similar composition. Amidst the
hillocks composed of these rocks, I found in three places, smooth
conical hills of phonolite, abounding with fine crystals of glassy
feldspar, and with needles of hornblende. These cones of phonolite,
I believe, bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic
strata which some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock, in
another part of the island, bear to the surrounding basalt, namely,
that both have been injected. The rocks of a feldspathic nature
being anterior in origin to the basaltic strata, which cap them, as
well as to the basaltic streams of the coast-plains, accords with
the usual order of succession of these two grand divisions of the
volcanic series.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. D'Aubuisson "Trait&eacute; de G&eacute;ognosie"
(tome ii, p. 569) mentions, on the authority of M. Marcel de
Serres, masses of green earth near Montpellier, which are supposed
to be due to the decomposition of olivine. I do not, however, find,
that the action of this mineral under the blowpipe being entirely
altered, as it becomes decomposed, has been noticed; and the
knowledge of this fact is important, as at first it appears highly
improbable that a hard, transparent, refractory mineral should be
changed into a soft, easily fused clay, like this of St. Jago. I
shall hereafter describe a green substance, forming threads within
the cells of some vesicular basaltic rocks in Van Diemen's Land,
which behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of St. Jago;
but its occurrence in cylindrical threads, shows it cannot have
resulted from the decomposition of olivine, a mineral always
existing in the form of grains or crystals.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 180">page 180</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strata of most of these hills in the upper part, where alone
the planes of division are distinguishable, are inclined at a small
angle from the interior of the island towards the sea-coast. The
inclination is not the same in each hill; in that marked A it is
less than in B, D, or E; in C the strata are scarcely deflected
from a horizontal plane, and in F (as far as I could judge without
ascending it) they are slightly inclined in a reverse direction,
that is, inwards and towards the centre of the island.
Notwithstanding these differences of inclination, their
correspondence in external form, and in the composition both of
their upper and lower parts,- -their relative position in one
curved line, with their steepest sides turned inwards,&mdash;all
seem to show that they originally formed parts of one platform;
which platform, as before remarked, probably extended round a
considerable portion of the circumference of the island. The upper
strata certainly flowed as lava, and probably beneath the sea, as
perhaps did the lower feldspathic masses: how then come these
strata to hold their present position, and whence were they
erupted?</p>

<p>In the centre of the island<sup>1</sup> there are lofty
mountains, but they are separated from the steep inland flanks of
these hills by a wide space of lower country: the interior
mountains, moreover, seem to have been the source of those great
streams of basaltic lava which, contracting as they pass between
the bases of the hills in question, expand into the coast- plains.
Round the shores of St. Helena there is a rudely formed ring of
basaltic rocks, and at Mauritius there are remnants of another such
a ring round part, if not round the whole, of the island; here
again the same question immediately occurs, how came these masses
to hold their present position, and whence were they erupted? The
same answer, whatever it may be, probably applies in these three
cases; and in a future chapter we shall recur to this subject.</p>

<p><i>Valleys near the coast.</i>&mdash;These are broad, very flat,
and generally bounded by low cliff-formed sides. Portions of the
basaltic plain are sometimes nearly or quite isolated by them; of
which fact, the space on which the town of Praya stands offers an
instance. The great valley west of the town has its bottom filled
up to a depth of more than twenty feet by well-rounded pebbles,
which in some parts are firmly cemented together by white
calcareous matter. There can be no doubt, from the form of these
valleys, that they were scooped out by the waves of the sea, during
that equable elevation of the land, of which the horizontal
calcareous deposit, with its existing species of marine remains,
gives evidence. Considering how well shells have been preserved in
this stratum, it is singular that I could not find even a single
small fragment of shell in the conglomerate at the bottom of the
valleys. The bed of pebbles in the valley west of the town is</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I saw very little of the inland parts of the
island. Near the village of St. Domingo, there are magnificent
cliffs of rather coarsely crystallised basaltic lava. Following the
little stream in this valley, about a mile above the village, the
base of the great cliff was formed of a compact fine-grained
basalt, conformably covered by a bed of pebbles. Near Fuentes, I
met with pap-formed hills of the compact feldspathic series of
rocks.</p>

<p>intersected by a second valley joining it as a tributary, but
even this valley appears much too wide and flat-bottomed to have
been formed by the small quantity of water, which falls only during
one short wet season; for at other times of the year these valleys
are absolutely dry.</p>

<p><i>Recent conglomerate.</i>&mdash;On the shores of Quail Island,
I found fragments of brick, bolts of iron, pebbles, and large
fragments of basalt, united by a scanty base of impure calcareous
matter into a firm conglomerate. To show how exceedingly firm this
recent conglomerate is, I may mention, that I endeavoured with a
heavy geological hammer to knock out a thick bolt of iron, which
was embedded a little above low-water mark, but was quite unable to
succeed.</p>

<p><i>Fernando Noronha.</i>&mdash;During our short visit at this
and the four following islands, I observed very little worthy of
description. Fernando Noronha is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, in
lat. 3&deg; 50' S., and 230 miles distant from the coast of South
America. It consists of several islets, together nine miles in
length by three in breadth. The whole seems to be of volcanic
origin; although there is no appearance of any crater, or of any
one central eminence. The most remarkable feature is a hill 1,000
feet high, of which the upper 400 feet consist of a precipitous,
singularly shaped pinnacle, formed of columnar phonolite,
containing numerous crystals of glassy feldspar, and a few needles
of hornblende. From the highest accessible point of this hill, I
could distinguish in different parts of the group several other
conical hills, apparently of the same nature. At St. Helena there
are similar, great, conical, protuberant masses of phonolite,
nearly one thousand feet in height, which have been formed by the
injection of fluid feldspathic lava into yielding strata. If this
hill has had, as is probable, a similar origin, denudation has been
here effected on an enormous scale. Near the base of this hill, I
observed beds of white tuff, intersected by numerous dikes, some of
amygdaloidal basalt and others of trachyte; and beds of slaty
phonolite with the planes of cleavage directed N.W. and S.E. Parts
of this rock, where the crystals were scanty, closely resembled
common clay-slate, altered by the contact of a trap-dike. The
lamination of rocks, which undoubtedly have once been fluid,
appears to me a subject well deserving attention. On the beach
there were numerous</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 182">page 182</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>fragments of compact basalt, of which rock a distant
fa&ccedil;ade of columns seemed to be formed.</p>

<p><i>Terceira in the Azores.</i>&mdash;The central parts of this
island consist of irregularly rounded mountains of no great
elevation, composed of trachyte, which closely resembles in general
character the trachyte of Ascension, presently to be described.
This formation is in many parts overlaid, in the usual order of
superposition, by streams of basaltic lava, which near the coast
compose nearly the whole surface. The course which these streams
have followed from their craters, can often be followed by the eye.
The town of Angra is overlooked by a crateriform hill (Mount
Brazil), entirely built of thin strata of fine-grained, harsh,
brown-coloured tuff. The upper beds are seen to overlap the
basaltic streams on which the town stands. This hill is almost
identical in structure and composition with numerous crateriformed
hills in the Galapagos Archipelago.</p>

<p><i>Effects of steam on the trachytic rocks.</i>&mdash;In the
central part of the island there is a spot, where steam is
constantly issuing in jets from the bottom of a small ravine-like
hollow, which has no exit, and which abuts against a range of
trachytic mountains. The steam is emitted from several irregular
fissures: it is scentless, soon blackens iron, and is of much too
high temperature to be endured by the hand. The manner in which the
solid trachyte is changed on the borders of these orifices is
curious: first, the base becomes earthy, with red freckles
evidently due to the oxidation of particles of iron; then it
becomes soft; and lastly, even the crystals of glassy feldspar
yield to the dissolving agent. After the mass is converted into
clay, the oxide of iron seems to be entirely removed from some
parts, which are left perfectly white, whilst in other neighbouring
parts, which are of the brightest red colour, it seems to be
deposited in greater quantity; some other masses are marbled with
two distinct colours. Portions of the white clay, now that they are
dry, cannot be distinguished by the eye from the finest prepared
chalk; and when placed between the teeth they feel equally
soft-grained; the inhabitants use this substance for white-washing
their houses. The cause of the iron being dissolved in one part,
and close by being again deposited, is obscure; but the fact has
been observed in several other places.<sup>1</sup> In some
half-decayed specimens, I found small, globular aggregations of
yellow hyalite, resembling gum-arabic, which no doubt had been
deposited by the steam.</p>

<p>As there is no escape for the rain-water, which trickles down
the sides of the ravine-like hollow, whence the steam issues, it
must all percolate downwards through the fissures at its bottom.
Some of the inhabitants informed me that it was on record that
flames (some luminous appearance?) had originally proceeded from
these cracks,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Spallanzani, Dolomieu, and Hoffman have
described similar cases in the Italian volcanic islands. Dolomieu
says the iron at the Panza Islands is redeposited in the form of
veins (p. 86 "M&egrave;moire sur les Isles Ponces"). These authors
likewise believe that the steam deposits silica: it is now
experimentally known that vapour of a high temperature is able to
dissolve silica.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 183">page 183</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and that the flames had been succeeded by the steam; but I was
not able to ascertain how long this was ago, or anything certain on
the subject. When viewing the spot, I imagined that the injection
of a large mass of rock. like the cone of phonolite at Fernando
Noronha, in a semi-fluid state, by arching the surface might have
caused a wedge-shaped hollow with cracks at the bottom, and that
the rain-water percolating to the neighbourhood of the heated mass,
would during many succeeding years be driven back in the form of
steam.</p>

<p><i>Tahiti (Otaheite).</i>&mdash;I visited only a part of the
north-western side of this island, and this part is entirely
composed of volcanic rocks. Near the coast there are several
varieties of basalt, some abounding with large crystals of augite
and tarnished olivine, others compact and earthy,&mdash;some
slightly vesicular, and others occasionally amygdaloidal. These
rocks are generally much decomposed, and to my surprise, I found in
several sections that it was impossible to distinguish, even
approximately, the line of separation between the decayed lava and
the alternating beds of tuff. Since the specimens have become dry,
it is rather more easy to distinguish the decomposed igneous rocks
from the sedimentary tuffs. This gradation in character between
rocks having such widely different origins, may I think be
explained by the yielding under pressure of the softened sides of
the vesicular cavities, which in many volcanic rocks occupy a large
proportion of their bulk. As the vesicles generally increase in
size and number in the upper parts of a stream of lava, so would
the effects of their compression increase; the yielding, moreover,
of each lower vesicle must tend to disturb all the softened matter
above it. Hence we might expect to trace a perfect gradation from
an unaltered crystalline rock to one in which all the particles
(although originally forming part of the same solid mass) had
undergone mechanical displacement; and such particles could hardly
be distinguished from others of similar composition, which had been
deposited as sediment. As lavas are sometimes laminated in their
upper parts even horizontal lines, appearing like those of aqueous
deposition, could not in all cases be relied on as a criterion of
sedimentary origin. From these considerations it is not surprising
that formerly many geologists believed in real transitions from
aqueous deposits, through wacke, into igneous traps.</p>

<p>In the valley of Tia-auru, the commonest rocks are basalts with
much olivine, and in some cases almost composed of large crystals
of augite. I picked up some specimens, with much glassy feldspar,
approaching in character to trachyte. There were also many large
blocks of vesicular basalt, with the cavities beautifully lined
with chabasie (?), and radiating bundles of mesotype. Some of these
specimens presented a curious appearance, owing to a number of the
vesicles being half filled up with a white, soft, earthy mesotypic
mineral, which intumesced under the blowpipe in a remarkable
manner. As the upper surfaces in all the half-filled cells are
exactly parallel, it is evident that this substance has sunk to the
bottom of each cell from its weight. Sometimes, however, it
entirely fills the cells. Other cells are either quite</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 184">page 184</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>filled, or lined, with small crystals, apparently of chabasie;
these crystals, also, frequently line the upper half of the cells
partly filled with the earthy mineral, as well as the upper surface
of this substance itself, in which case the two minerals appear to
blend into each other. I have never seen any other
amygdaloid<sup>1</sup> with the cells half filled in the manner
here described; and it is difficult to imagine the causes which
determined the earthy mineral to sink from its gravity to the
bottom of the cells, and the crystalline mineral to adhere in a
coating of equal thickness round the sides of the cells.</p>

<p>The basic strata on the sides of the valley are gently inclined
seaward, and I nowhere observed any sign of disturbance; the strata
are separated from each other by thick, compact beds of
conglomerate, in which the fragments are large, some being rounded,
but most angular. From the character of these beds, from the
compact and crystalline condition of most of the lavas, and from
the nature of the infiltrated minerals, I was led to conjecture
that they had originally flowed beneath the sea. This conclusion
agrees with the fact that the Rev. W. Ellis found marine remains at
a considerable height, which he believes were interstratified with
volcanic matter; as is likewise described to be the case by Messrs.
Tyerman and Bennett at Huaheine, an island in this same
archipelago. Mr. Stutchbury also discovered near the summit of one
of the loftiest mountains of Tahiti, at the height of several
thousand feet, a stratum of semi-fossil coral. None of these
remains have been specifically examined. On the coast, where masses
of coral-rock would have afforded the clearest evidence, I looked
in vain for any signs of recent elevation. For references to the
above authorities, and for more detailed reasons for not believing
that Tahiti has been recently elevated, I must refer to the
"Structure and Distribution of Coral-Reefs."</p>

<p><i>Mauritius.</i>&mdash;Approaching this island on the northern
or north-western side, a curved chain of bold mountains, surmounted
by rugged pinnacles, is seen to rise from a smooth border of
cultivated land, which gently slopes down to the coast. At the
first glance, one is tempted to believe that the sea lately reached
the base of these mountains, and upon examination, this view, at
least with respect to the inferior parts of the border, is found to
be perfectly correct. Several authors<sup>2</sup> have described
masses of upraised coral-rock round the greater part of the
circumference of the island. Between Tamarin Bay</p>

<p class="fnote">1. MacCulloch, however, has described and given a
plate of ("Geolog. Trans." 1st series, vol. iv, p. 225) a trap
rock, with cavities filled up horizontally with quartz and
chalcedony. The upper halves of these cavities are often filled by
layers, which follow each irregularity of the surface, and by
little depending stalactites of the same siliceous substances.<br>

Captain Lloyd has lately, in the "Proceedings of the Geological
Society" (vol. iii, p. 317), described carefully some of these
masses. In the "Voyage &agrave; l'Isle de France, par un Officier

<p>and the Great Black River I observed, in company with Captain
Lloyd, two hillocks of coral-rock, formed in their lower part of
hard calcareous sandstone, and in their upper of great blocks,
slightly aggregated, of Astr&aelig;a and Madrepora, and of
fragments of basalt; they were divided into beds dipping seaward,
in one case at an angle of 8&deg;, and in the other at 18&deg;;
they had a water-worn appearance, and they rose abruptly from a
smooth surface, strewed with rolled d&eacute;bris of organic
remains, to a height of about twenty feet. The Officier du Roi, in
his most interesting tour in 1768 round the island, has described
masses of upraised coral-rocks, still retaining that moat-like
structure (see my "Coral Reefs") which is characteristic of the
living reefs. On the coast northward of Port Louis, I found the
lava concealed for a considerable space inland by a conglomerate of
corals and shells, like those on the beach, but in parts
consolidated by red ferruginous matter. M. Bory St. Vincent has
described similar calcareous beds over nearly the whole of the
plain of Pamplemousses. Near Port Louis, when turning over some
large stones, which lay in the bed of a stream at the head of a
protected creek, and at the height of some yards above the level of
spring tides, I found several shells of serpula still adhering to
their under sides.</p>

<p>The jagged mountains near Port Louis rise to a height of between
two and three thousand feet; they consist of strata of basalt,
obscurely separated from each other by firmly aggregated beds of
fragmentary matter; and they are intersected by a few vertical
dikes. The basalt in some parts abounds with large crystals of
augite and olivine, and is generally compact. The interior of the
island forms a plain, raised probably about a thousand feet above
the level of the sea, and composed of streams of lava which have
flowed round and between the rugged basaltic mountains. These more
recent lavas are also basaltic, but less compact, and some of them
abound with feldspar, so that they even fuse into a pale coloured
glass. On the banks of the Great River, a section is exposed nearly
five hundred feet deep, worn through numerous thin sheets of the
lava of this series, which are separated from each other by beds of
scori&aelig;. They seem to have been of subaerial formation, and to
have flowed from several points of eruption on the central
platform, of which the Piton du Milieu is said to be the principal
one. There are also several volcanic cones, apparently of this
modern period, round the circumference of the island, especially at
the northern end, where they form separate islets.</p>

<p>The mountains composed of the more compact and crystalline
basalt, form the main skeleton of the island. M. Bailly<sup>1</sup>
states that they all "se d&eacute;veloppent autour d'elle comme une
ceinture d'immenses remparts, toutes affectant une pente plus ou
moins enclin&eacute;e vers le rivage de la mer; tandis, au
contraire, que vers le centre de l'ile elles presentent une coupe
abrupte, et souvent taill&eacute;e &agrave; pic. Toutes ces
montagnes sont form&eacute;es de couches parall&egrave;les
inclin&eacute;es du centre de l'ile vers la mer." These statements
have been disputed, though not in detail, by M. Quoy, in the voyage
of Freycinet. As far as my limited means of observation went, I
found</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 186">page 186</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>them perfectly correct.<sup>1</sup> The mountains on the N.W.
side of the island, which I examined, namely, La Pouce, Peter
Botts, Corps de Garde, Les Mamelles, and apparently another farther
southward, have precisely the external shape and stratification
described by M. Bailly. They form about a quarter of his girdle of
ramparts. Although these mountains now stand quite detached, being
separated from each other by breaches, even several miles in width,
through which deluges of lava have flowed from the interior of the
island; nevertheless, seeing their close general similarity, one
must feel convinced that they originally formed parts of one
continuous mass. Judging from the beautiful map of the Mauritius,
published by the Admiralty from a French MS., there is a range of
mountains (M. Bamboo) on the opposite side of the island, which
correspond in height, relative position, and external form, with
those just described. Whether the girdle was ever complete may well
be doubted; but from M. Bailly's statements, and my own
observations, it may be safely concluded that mountains with
precipitous inland flanks, and composed of strata dipping outwards,
once extended round a considerable portion of the circumference of
the island. The ring appears to have been oval and of vast size;
its shorter axis, measured across from the inner sides of the
mountains near Port Louis and those near Grand Port, being no less
than thirteen geographical miles in length. M. Bailly boldly
supposes that this enormous gulf, which has since been filled up to
a great extent by streams of modern lava, was formed by the sinking
in of the whole upper part of one great volcano.</p>

<p>It is singular in how many respects those portions of St. Jago
and of Mauritius which I visited agree in their geological history.
At both islands, mountains of similar external form,
stratification, and (at least in their upper beds) composition,
follow in a curved chain the coast-line. These mountains in each
case appear originally to have formed parts of one continuous mass.
The basaltic strata of which they are composed, from their compact
and crystalline structure, seem, when contrasted with the
neighbouring basaltic streams of subaerial formation, to have
flowed beneath the pressure of the sea, and to have been
subsequently elevated. We may suppose that the wide breaches
between the mountains were in both cases worn by the waves, during
their gradual elevation&mdash;of which process, within recent
times, there is abundant evidence on the coast-land of both
islands. At both, vast streams of more recent basaltic lavas have
flowed from the interior of the island, round and between the
ancient basaltic hills; at both, moreover, recent cones of eruption
are scattered around the circumference of the island; but at
neither have eruptions taken place within the period of history. As
remarked in the last chapter, it is probable that these ancient
basaltic mountains, which resemble (at least in many respects) the
basal and disturbed remnants of two gigantic volcanoes, owe their
present form, structure, and position, to the action of similar
causes.</p>

<p><i>St. Paul's Rocks.</i>&mdash;This small island is situated in
the Atlantic Ocean, nearly one degree north of the equator, and 540
miles distant from South America, in 29&deg; 15' west longitude.
Its highest point is scarcely fifty feet above the level of the
sea; its outline is irregular, and its entire circumference barely
three-quarters of a mile. This little point of rock rises abruptly
out of the ocean; and, except on its western side, soundings were
not obtained, even at the short distance of a quarter of a mile
from its shore. It is not of volcanic origin; and this
circumstance, which is the most remarkable point in its history (as
will hereafter be referred to), properly ought to exclude it from
the present volume. It is composed of rocks, unlike any which I
have met with, and which I cannot characterise by any name, and
must therefore describe.</p>

<p>The simplest, and one of the most abundant kinds, is a very
compact, heavy, greenish-black rock, having an angular, irregular
fracture, with some points just hard enough to scratch glass, and
infusible. This variety passes into others of paler green tints,
less hard, but with a more crystalline fracture, and translucent on
their edges; and these are fusible into a green enamel. Several
other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable
threads of dark-green serpentine, and by having calcareous matter
in their interstices. These rocks have an obscure, concretionary
structure, and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo
fragments. These angular pseudo fragments consist of the
first-described dark green rock, of a brown softer kind, of
serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which, perhaps, is
related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular,
calcareo-ferruginous, soft stones. There is no distinct
stratification, but parts are imperfectly laminated; and the whole
abounds with innumerable veins, and vein-like masses, both small
and large. Of these vein-like masses, some calcareous ones, which
contain minute fragments of shells, are clearly of subsequent
origin to the others.</p>

<p><i>A glossy incrustation.</i>&mdash;Extensive portions of these
rocks are coated by a layer of a glossy polished substance, with a
pearly lustre and of a greyish white colour; it follows all the
inequalities of the surface, to which it is firmly attached. When
examined with a lens, it is found to consist of numerous
exceedingly thin layers, their aggregate thickness being about the
tenth of an inch. It is considerably harder than calcareous spar,
but can be scratched with a knife; under the blowpipe it scales
off, decrepitates, slightly blackens, emits a fetid odour, and
becomes strongly alkaline: it does not effervesce in
acids.<sup>1</sup> I presume this substance has been deposited by
water draining from the birds' dung, with which the rocks are
covered. At Ascension, near a cavity in the rocks which was filled
with a laminated mass of infiltrated birds' dung, I found some
irregularly formed, stalactitical masses of apparently the same
nature. These masses, when broken, had an earthy texture; but on
their outsides, and especially at their extremities, they were
formed of a pearly substance, generally in little globules, like
the</p>

<p class="fnote">1. In my "Journal" I have described this
substance; I then believed that it was an impure phosphate of
lime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 188">page 188</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>enamel of teeth, but more translucent, and so hard as just to
scratch plate-glass. This substance slightly blackens under the
blowpipe, emits a bad smell, then becomes quite white, swelling a
little, and fuses into a dull white enamel; it does not become
alkaline; nor does it effervesce in acids. The whole mass had a
collapsed appearance, as if in the formation of the hard glossy
crust the whole had shrunk much. At the Abrolhos Islands on the
coast of Brazil, where also there is much birds' dung, I found a
great quantity of a brown, arborescent substance adhering to some
trap-rock. In its arborescent form, this substance singularly
resembles some of the branched species of Nullipora. Under the
blowpipe, it behaves like the specimens from Ascension; but it is
less hard and glossy, and the surface has not the shrunk
appearance.</p>

<p>This island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 8&deg;
S., long. 14&deg; W. It has the form of an irregular triangle (see
map below), each side being about six miles in length. Its highest
point is 2,870 feet<sup>1</sup> above the level of the sea. The
whole is volcanic, and, from the absence of proofs to the contrary,
I believe of subaerial origin. The fundamental rock is everywhere
of a pale colour, generally compact, and of a feldspathic nature.
In the S.E. portion of the island, where the highest land is
situated, well characterised trachyte, and other congenerous rocks
of that varying here and there a hill or single point of rock (one
of which near the sea-coast, north of the Fort, is only two or
three yards across) of the trachyte still remaining exposed.</p>

<p><i>Basaltic rocks.</i>&mdash;The overlying basaltic lava is in
some parts extremely vesicular, in others little so; it is of a
black colour, but sometimes contains crystals of glassy feldspar,
and seldom much olivine. These streams appear to have possessed
singularly little fluidity; their side walls and lower ends being
very steep, and even as much as between twenty and thirty feet in
height. Their surface is extraordinarily rugged,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and from a short distance appears as if studded with small
craters. These projections consist of broad, irregularly conical,
hillocks, traversed by fissures, and composed of the same unequally
scoriaceous basalt with the surrounding streams, but having an
obscure tendency to a columnar structure; they rise to a height
between ten and thirty feet above the general surface, and have
been formed, as I presume, by the heaping up of the viscid lava at
points of greater resistance. At the base of several of these
hillocks, and occasionally likewise on more level parts, solid
ribs, composed of angulo-globular masses of basalt, resembling in
size and outline arched sewers or gutters of brickwork, but not
being hollow, project between two or three feet above the surface
of the streams; what their origin may have been, I do not know.
Many of the superficial fragments from these basaltic streams
present singularly convoluted forms; and some specimens could
hardly be distinguished from logs of dark-coloured wood without
their bark.</p>

<p>Many of the basaltic streams can be traced, either to points of
eruption at the base of the great central mass of trachyte, or to
separate, conical, red-coloured hills, which are scattered over the
northern and western borders of the island. Standing on the central
eminence, I counted between twenty and thirty of these cones of
eruption. The greater number of them had their truncated summits
cut off obliquely, and they all sloped towards the S.E., whence the
trade-wind blows.<sup>1</sup> This structure no doubt has been
caused by the ejected fragments and ashes being always blown,
during eruptions, in greater quantity towards one side than towards
the other. M. Moreau de Jonnes has made a similar observation with
respect to the volcanic orifices in the West Indian Islands.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic bombs.</i>&mdash;These occur in great numbers
strewed on the ground, and some of them lie at considerable
distances from any points of eruption. They vary in size from that
of an apple to that of a man's body; they are either spherical or
pear-shaped, or with the hinder part (corresponding to the tail of
a comet) irregular, studded with projecting points, and even
concave. Their surfaces are rough, and fissured with branching
cracks; their internal structure is either irregularly scoriaceous
and compact, or it presents a symmetrical and very curious
appearance. An irregular segment of a bomb of this latter kind, of
which I found several, is accurately represented in figure No. 3.
Its size was about that of a man's head. The whole interior is
coarsely cellular; the cells averaging in diameter about the tenth
of an inch; but nearer the outside they gradually decrease in size.
This part is succeeded by a well-defined shell of compact lava,
having a nearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch;
and the shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely
cellular lava (the cells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth
of an inch in diameter), which forms the external surface: the line
separating the shell of compact</p>

<p class="fnote">1. M. Lesson in the "Zoology of the Voyage of the
<i>Coquille</i>," p. 490 has observed this fact. Mr. Hennah
("Geolog. Proceedings," 1835, p. 189) further remarks that the most
extensive beds of ashes at Ascension invariably occur on the
leeward side of the island.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 190">page 190</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>lava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined.
This structure is very simply explained, if we suppose a mass of
viscid, scoriaceous matter, to be projected with a rapid, rotatory
motion through the air; for whilst the external crust, from
cooling, became solidified (in the state we now see it), the
centrifugal force, by relieving the pressure in the interior parts
of the bomb, would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells;
but these being driven by the same force against the
already-hardened crust, would become, the nearer they were to this
part, smaller and smaller or less expanded, until they became
packed into a solid, concentric shell. As we know that chips from a
grindstone<sup>1</sup> can be flirted off, when made to revolve
with sufficient velocity, we need not doubt that the centrifugal
force would have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb,
in the manner here supposed. Geologists have remarked, that the
external form of a bomb at once bespeaks the history of its aerial
course, and few now see that the internal structure can speak, with
almost equal plainness, of its rotatory movement.</p>

<p>M. Bory St. Vincent<sup>2</sup> has described some balls of lava
from the Isle of Bourbon, which have a closely similar structure.
His explanation, however (if I understand it rightly), is very
different from that which</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have given; for he supposes that they have rolled, like
snowballs, down the sides of the crater. M. Beudant,<sup>1</sup>
also, has described some singular little balls of obsidian, never
more than six or eight inches in diameter, which he found strewed
on the surface of the ground: their form is always oval; sometimes
they are much swollen in the middle, and even spindle-shaped: their
surface is regularly marked with concentric ridges and furrows, all
of which on the same ball are at right angles to one axis: their
interior is compact and glassy. M. Beudant supposes that masses of
lava, when soft, were shot into the air, with a rotatory movement
round the same axis, and that the form and superficial ridges of
the bombs were thus produced. Sir Thomas Mitchell has given me what
at first appears to be the half of a much flattened oval ball of
obsidian; it has a singular artificial-like appearance, which is
well represented (of the natural size) in figure No. 4. It was
found in its present state, on a great sandy plain between the
rivers Darling and Murray, in Australia, and at the distance of
several hundred miles from any known volcanic region. It seems to
have been embedded in some reddish tufaceous matter; and may have
been transported either by the aborigines or by natural means. The
external saucer consists of compact obsidian, of a bottle-green
colour, and is filled with finely cellular black lava, much less
transparent and glassy than the obsidian. The external surface is
marked with four or five not quite perfect ridges, which are
represented rather too distinctly in figure No. 4. Here, then, we
have the external structure described by M. Beudant, and the
internal cellular condition of the bombs from Ascension. The lip of
the saucer is slightly concave, exactly like the margin of a
soup-plate, and its inner edge overlaps a little the central
cellular lava. This structure is so symmetrical round the entire
circumference, that one is forced to suppose that the bomb burst
during its rotatory course, before being quite solidified, and that
the lip and edges were thus slightly modified and turned inwards.
It may be remarked that the superficial ridges are in planes, at
right angles to an axis, transverse to the longer axis of the
flattened oval: to explain this circumstance, we may suppose that
when the bomb burst, the axis of rotation changed.</p>

<p><i>Aeriform explosions.</i>&mdash;The flanks of Green Mountain
and the surrounding country are covered by a great mass, some
hundred feet in thickness, of loose fragments. The lower beds
generally consist of fine-grained, slightly consolidated
tuffs,<sup>2</sup> and the upper beds of great</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "Voyage en Hongrie," tome ii, p. 214.<br>
2. Some of this peperino, or tuff, is sufficiently hard not to be
broken by the greatest force of the fingers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 192">page 192</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>loose fragments, with alternating finer beds.<sup>1</sup> One
white ribbon-like layer of decomposed, pumiceous breccia, was
curiously bent into deep unbroken curves, beneath each of the large
fragments in the superincumbent stratum. From the relative position
of these beds, I presume that a narrow-mouthed crater, standing
nearly in the position of Green Mountain, like a great air-gun,
shot forth, before its final extinction, this vast accumulation of
loose matter. Subsequently to this event, considerable dislocations
have taken place, and an oval circus has been formed by subsidence.
This sunken space lies at the north-eastern foot of Green Mountain,
and is well represented in Map 2. Its longer axis, which is
connected with a N.E. and S.W. line of fissure, is three-fifths of
a nautical mile in length; its sides are nearly perpendicular,
except in one spot, and about four hundred feet in height; they
consist, in the lower part, of a pale basalt with feldspar, and in
the upper part, of the tuff and loose ejected fragments; the bottom
is smooth and level, and under almost any other climate a deep lake
would have been formed here. From the thickness of the bed of loose
fragments, with which the surrounding country is covered, the
amount of aeriform matter necessary for their projection must have
been enormous; hence we may suppose it probable that after the
explosions vast subterranean caverns were left, and that the
falling in of the roof of one of these produced the hollow here
described. At the Galapagos Archipelago, pits of a similar
character, but of a much smaller size, frequently occur at the
bases of small cones of eruption.</p>

<p><i>Ejected granitic fragments.</i>&mdash;In the neighbourhood of
Green Mountain, fragments of extraneous rock are not unfrequently
found embedded in the midst of masses of scori&aelig;. Lieutenant
Evans, to whose kindness I am indebted for much information, gave
me several specimens, and I found others myself. They nearly all
have a granitic structure, are brittle, harsh to the touch, and
apparently of altered colours. <i>First</i>, a white syenite,
streaked and mottled with red; it consists of well-crystallised
feldspar, numerous grains of quartz, and brilliant, though small,
crystals of hornblende. The feldspar and hornblende in this and the
succeeding cases have been determined by the reflecting goniometer,
and the quartz by its action under the blowpipe. The feldspar in
these ejected fragments, like the glassy kind in the trachyte, is
from its cleavage a potash-feldspar. <i>Secondly</i>, a brick-red
mass of feldspar, quartz, and small dark patches of a decayed
mineral; one minute particle of which I was able to ascertain, by
its cleavage, to be hornblende.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. On the northern side of the Green Mountain a
thin seam, about an inch in thickness, of compact oxide of iron,
extends over a considerable area; it lies conformably in the lower
part of the stratified mass of ashes and fragments. This substance
is of a reddish-brown colour, with an almost metallic lustre; it is
not magnetic, but becomes so after having been heated under the
blowpipe, by which it is blackened and partly fused. This seam of
compact stone, by intercepting the little rain-water which falls on
the island, gives rise to a small dripping spring, first discovered
by Dampier. It is the only fresh water on the island, so that the
possibility of its being inhabited has entirely depended on the
occurrence of this ferruginous layer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 193">page 193</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, a mass of confusedly crystallised white
feldspar, with little nests of a dark-coloured mineral, often
carious, externally rounded, having a glossy fracture, but no
distinct cleavage: from comparison with the second specimen, I have
no doubt that it is fused hornblende. <i>Fourthly</i>, a rock,
which at first appears a simple aggregation of distinct and
large-sized crystals of dusty-coloured Labrador
feldspar;<sup>1</sup> but in their interstices there is some white
granular feldspar, abundant scales of mica, a little altered
hornblende, and, as I believe, no quartz. I have described these
fragments in detail, because it is rare<sup>2</sup> to find
granitic rocks ejected from volcanoes with their <i>minerals
unchanged</i>, as is the case with the first specimen, and
partially with the second. One other large fragment, found in
another spot, is deserving of notice; it is a conglomerate,
containing small fragments of granitic, cellular, and jaspery
rocks, and of hornstone porphyries, embedded in a base of wacke,
threaded by numerous thin layers of a concretionary pitchstone
passing into obsidian. These layers are parallel, slightly
tortuous, and short; they thin out at their ends, and resemble in
form the layers of quartz in gneiss. It is probable that these
small embedded fragments were not separately ejected, but were
entangled in a fluid volcanic rock, allied to obsidian; and we
shall presently see that several varieties of this latter series of
rock assume a laminated structure.</p>

<p><i>Trachytic series of rocks.</i>&mdash;Those occupy the more
elevated and central, and likewise the south-eastern, parts of the
island. The trachyte is generally of a pale brown colour, stained
with small darker patches; it contains broken and bent crystals of
glassy feldspar, grains of specular iron, and black microscopical
points, which latter, from being easily fused, and then becoming
magnetic, I presume are hornblende. The greater number of the
hills, however, are composed of a quite white, friable stone,
appearing like a trachytic tuff. Obsidian,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Professor Miller has been so kind as to examine
this mineral. He obtained two good cleavages of 86&deg; 30' and
86&deg; 50'. The mean of several, which I made, was 86&deg; 30'.
Professor Miller states that these crystals, when reduced to a fine
powder, are soluble in hydrochloric acid, leaving some undissolved
silex behind; the addition of oxalate of ammonia gives a copious
precipitate of lime. He further remarks, that according to Von
Kobell, anorthite (a mineral occurring in the ejected fragments at
Mount Somma) is always white and transparent, so that if this be
the case, these crystals from Ascension must be considered as
Labrador feldspar. Professor Miller adds, that he has seen an
account, in Erdmann's "Journal f&uuml;r tecnische Chemie," of a
mineral ejected from a volcano which had the external characters of
Labrador feldspar, but differed in the analysis from that given by
mineralogists of this mineral: the author attributed this
difference to an error in the analysis of Labrador feldspar, which
is very old.<br>
2. Daubeny, in his work on Volcanoes (p. 386), remarks that this is
the case; and Humboldt, in his "Personal Narrative," vol. i, p.
236, says "In general, the masses of known primitive rocks, I mean
those which perfectly resemble our granites, gneiss, and
mica-slate, are very rare in lavas: the substances we generally
denote by the name of granite, thrown out by Vesuvius, are mixtures
of nepheline, mica, and pyroxene."</p>

<p>hornstone, and several kinds of laminated feldspathic rocks, are
associated with the trachyte. There is no distinct stratification;
nor could I distinguish a crateriform structure in any of the hills
of this series. Considerable dislocations have taken place; and
many fissures in these rocks are yet left open, or are only
partially filled with loose fragments. Within the
space,<sup>1</sup> mainly formed of trachyte, some basaltic streams
have burst forth; and not far from the summit of Green Mountain,
there is one stream of quite black, vesicular basalt, containing
minute crystals of glassy feldspar, which have a rounded
appearance.</p>

<p>The soft white stone above mentioned is remarkable from its
singular resemblance, when viewed in mass, to a sedimentary tuff:
it was long before I could persuade myself that such was not its
origin; and other geologists have been perplexed by closely similar
formations in trachytic regions. In two cases, this white earthy
stone formed isolated hills; in a third, it was associated with
columnar and laminated trachyte; but I was unable to trace an
actual junction. It contains numerous crystals of glassy feldspar
and black microscopical specks, and is marked with small darker
patches, exactly as in the surrounding trachyte. Its basis,
however, when viewed under the microscope, is generally quite
earthy; but sometimes it exhibits a decidedly crystalline
structure. On the hill marked "Crater of an old volcano," it passes
into a pale greenish-grey variety, differing only in its colour,
and in not being so earthy; the passage was in one case effected
insensibly; in another, it was formed by numerous, rounded and
angular, masses of the greenish variety, being embedded in the
white variety;&mdash;in this latter case, the appearance was very
much like that of a sedimentary deposit, torn up and abraded during
the deposition of a subsequent stratum. Both these varieties are
traversed by innumerable tortuous veins (presently to be
described), which are totally unlike injected dikes, or indeed any
other veins which I have ever seen. Both varieties include a few
scattered fragments, large and small, of dark- coloured scoriaceous
rocks, the cells of some of which are partially filled with the
white earthy stone; they likewise include some huge blocks of a
cellular porphyry.<sup>2</sup> These fragments project from the
weathered surface, and perfectly resemble fragments embedded in a
true sedimentary tuff. But as it is known that extraneous fragments
of cellular rock are sometimes included in columnar trachyte, in
phonolite,<sup>3</sup> and in other compact lavas, this
circumstance is not any real argument for the sedimentary origin of
the white earthy stone.<sup>4</sup> The insensible passage of the
greenish variety</p>

<p class="fnote">1. This space is nearly included by a line
sweeping round Green Mountain, and joining the hills, called the
Weather Port Signal, Holyhead, and that denominated (improperly in
a geological sense) "the Crater of an old volcano."<br>
2. The porphyry is dark coloured; it contains numerous, often
fractured, crystals of white opaque feldspar, also decomposing
crystals of oxide of iron; its vesicles include masses of delicate,
hair-like, crystals, apparently of analcime.<br>
3. D'Aubuisson, "Trait&eacute; de G&eacute;ognosie," tome ii, p.
548.<br>
4. Dr. Daubeny (on Volcanoes, p. 180) seems to have been led to
believe that certain trachytic formations of Ischia and of the Puy
de D&ocirc;me, which closely resemble these of Ascension, were of
sedimentary origin, chiefly from the frequent presence in them "of
scoriform portions, different in colour from the matrix." Dr.
Daubeny adds, that on the other hand, Brocchi, and other eminent
geologists, have considered these beds as earthy varieties of
trachyte; he considers the subject deserving of further
attention.</p>

<p>into the white one, and likewise the more abrupt passage by
fragments of the former being embedded in the latter, might result
from slight differences in the composition of the same mass of
molten stone, and from the abrading action of one such part still
fluid on another part already solidified. The curiously formed
veins have, I believe, been formed by siliceous matter being
subsequently segregated. But my chief reason for believing that
these soft earthy stones, with their extraneous fragments, are not
of sedimentary origin, is the extreme improbability of crystals of
feldspar, black microscopical specks, and small stains of a darker
colour occurring in the same proportional numbers in an aqueous
deposit, and in masses of solid trachyte. Moreover, as I have
remarked, the microscope occasionally reveals a crystalline
structure in the apparently earthy basis. On the other hand, the
partial decomposition of such great masses of trachyte, forming
whole mountains, is undoubtedly a circumstance of not easy
explanation.</p>

<p><i>Veins in the earthy trachytic masses.</i>&mdash;These veins
are extraordinarily numerous, intersecting in the most complicated
manner both coloured varieties of the earthy trachyte: they are
best seen on the flanks of the "Crater of the old volcano." They
contain crystals of glassy feldspar, black microscopical specks and
little dark stains, precisely as in the surrounding rock; but the
basis is very different, being exceedingly hard, compact, somewhat
brittle, and of rather less easy fusibility. The veins vary much,
and suddenly, from the tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness;
they often thin out, not only on their edges, but in their central
parts, thus leaving round, irregular apertures; their surfaces are
rugged. They are inclined at every possible angle with the horizon,
or are horizontal; they are generally curvilinear, and often
interbranch one with another. From their hardness they withstand
weathering, and projecting two or three feet above the ground, they
occasionally extend some yards in length; these plate-like veins,
when struck, emit a sound, almost like that of a drum, and they may
be distinctly seen to vibrate; their fragments, which are strewed
on the ground, clatter like pieces of iron when knocked against
each other. They often assume the most singular forms; I saw a
pedestal of the earthy trachyte, covered by a hemispherical portion
of a vein, like a great umbrella, sufficiently large to shelter two
persons. I have never met with, or seen described, any veins like
these; but in form they resemble the ferruginous seams, due to some
process of segregation, occurring not uncommonly in
sandstones,&mdash;for instance, in the New Red sandstone of
England. Numerous veins of jasper and of siliceous sinter,
occurring on the summit of this same hill, show that there has been
some abundant source of silica, and as these plate-like veins
differ from the trachyte</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 196">page 196</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>only in their greater hardness, brittleness, and less easy
fusibility, it appears probable that their origin is due to the
segregation or infiltration of siliceous matter, in the same manner
as happens with the oxides of iron in many sedimentary rocks.</p>

<p><i>Siliceous sinter and jasper.</i>&mdash;The siliceous sinter
is either quite white, of little specific gravity, and with a
somewhat pearly fracture, passing into pinkish pearl quartz; or it
is yellowish white, with a harsh fracture, and it then contains an
earthy powder in small cavities. Both varieties occur, either in
large irregular masses in the altered trachyte, or in seams
included in broad, vertical, tortuous, irregular veins of a
compact, harsh stone of a dull red colour, appearing like a
sandstone. This stone, however, is only altered trachyte; and a
nearly similar variety, but often honeycombed, sometimes adheres to
the projecting plate-like veins, described in the last paragraph.
The jasper is of an ochre yellow or red colour; it occurs in large
irregular masses, and sometimes in veins, both in the altered
trachyte and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt. The cells
of the scoriaceous basalt are lined or filled with fine, concentric
layers of chalcedony, coated and studded with bright-red oxide of
iron. In this rock, especially in the rather more compact parts,
irregular angular patches of the red jasper are included, the edges
of which insensibly blend into the surrounding mass; other patches
occur having an intermediate character between perfect jasper and
the ferruginous, decomposed, basaltic base. In these patches, and
likewise in the large vein-like masses of jasper, there occur
little rounded cavities, of exactly the same size and form with the
air-cells, which in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined
with layers of chalcedony. Small fragments of the jasper, examined
under the microscope, seem to resemble the chalcedony with its
colouring matter not separated into layers, but mingled in the
siliceous paste, together with some impurities. I can understand
these facts,&mdash;namely, the blending of the jasper into the
semi-decomposed basalt,&mdash;its occurrence in angular patches,
which clearly do not occupy pre-existing hollows in the
rock,&mdash;and its containing little vesicles filled with
chalcedony, like those in the scoriaceous lava,&mdash;only on the
supposition that a fluid, probably the same fluid which deposited
the chalcedony in the air-cells, removed in those parts where there
were no cavities, the ingredients of the basaltic rock, and left in
their place silica and iron, and thus produced the jasper. In some
specimens of silicified wood, I have observed, that in the same
manner as in the basalt, the solid parts were converted into a
dark-coloured homogeneous stone, whereas the cavities formed by the
larger sap-vessels (which may be compared with the air-vesicles in
the basaltic lava) and other irregular hollows, apparently produced
by decay, were filled with concentric layers of chalcedony; in this
case, there can be little doubt that the same fluid deposited the
homogeneous base and the chalcedonic layers. After these
considerations, I cannot doubt but that the jasper of Ascension may
be viewed as a volcanic rock silicified, in precisely the same
sense as this term is applied to wood, when silicified; we are
equally ignorant of the means by which every atom of wood, whilst
in a perfect state, is</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 197">page 197</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>removed and replaced by atoms of silica, as we are of the means
by which the constituent parts of a volcanic rock could be thus
acted on.<sup>1</sup> I was led to the careful examination of these
rocks, and to the conclusion here given, from having heard the Rev.
Professor Henslow express a similar opinion, regarding the origin
in trap-rocks of many chalcedonies and agates. Siliceous deposits
seem to be very general, if not of universal occurrence, in
partially decomposed trachytic tuffs;<sup>2</sup> and as these
hills, according to the view above given, consist of trachyte
softened and altered in situ, the presence of free silica in this
case may be added as one more instance to the list.</p>

<p><i>Concretions in pumiceous tuff.</i>&mdash;The hill, marked in
Map 2 "Crater of an old volcano," has no claims to this
appellation, which I could discover, except in being surmounted by
a circular, very shallow, saucer-like summit, nearly half a mile in
diameter. This hollow has been nearly filled up with many
successive sheets of ashes and scori&aelig;, of different colours,
and slightly consolidated. Each successive saucer-shaped layer
crops out all round the margin, forming so many rings of various
colours, and giving to the hill a fantastic appearance. The outer
ring is broad, and of a white colour; hence it resembles a course
round which horses have been exercised, and has received the name
of the Devil's Riding School, by which it is most generally known.
These successive layers of ashes must have fallen over the whole
surrounding country, but they have all been blown away except in
this one hollow, in which probably moisture accumulated, either
during an extraordinary year when rain fell, or during the storms
often accompanying volcanic eruptions. One of the layers of a
pinkish colour, and chiefly derived from small, decomposed
fragments of pumice, is remarkable, from containing numerous
concretions. These are generally spherical, from half an inch to
three inches in diameter; but they are occasionally cylindrical,
like those of iron-pyrites in the chalk of Europe. They consist of
a very tough, compact, pale-brown stone, with a smooth and even
fracture. They are divided into concentric layers by thin white
partitions, resembling the external superficies; six or eight of
such layers are distinctly defined near the outside; but those
towards the inside generally become indistinct, and blend into a
homogeneous</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Beudant ("Voyage en Hongrie," tome iii, pp.
502, 504) describes kidney-shaped masses of jasper-opal, which
either blend into the surrounding trachytic conglomerate, or are
embedded in it like chalk-flints; and he compares them with the
fragments of opalised wood, which are abundant in this same
formation. Beudant, however, appears to have viewed the process of
their formation rather as one of simple infiltration than of
molecular exchange; but the presence of a concretion, wholly
different from the surrounding matter, if not formed in a
pre-existing hollow, clearly seems to me to require, either a
molecular or mechanical displacement of the atoms, which occupied
the space afterwards filled by it. The jasper-opal of Hungary
passes into chalcedony, and therefore in this case, as in that of
Ascension, jasper seems to be intimately related in origin with
chalcedony.<br>
2. Beudant ("Voyage Min.," tome iii, p. 507) enumerates cases in
Hungary, Germany, Central France, Italy, Greece, and Mexico.</p>

<p>mass. I presume that these concentric layers were formed by the
shrinking of the concretion, as it became compact. The interior
part is generally fissured by minute cracks or septaria, which are
lined, both by black, metallic, and by other white and crystalline
specks, the nature of which I was unable to ascertain. Some of the
larger concretions consist of a mere spherical shell, filled with
slightly consolidated ashes. The concretions contain a small
proportion of carbonate of lime: a fragment placed under the
blowpipe decrepitates, then whitens and fuses into a blebby enamel,
but does not become caustic. The surrounding ashes do not contain
any carbonate of lime; hence the concretions have probably been
formed, as is so often the case, by the aggregation of this
substance. I have not met with any account of similar concretions;
and considering their great toughness and compactness, their
occurrence in a bed, which probably has been subjected only to
atmospheric moisture, is remarkable.</p>

<p><i>Formation of calcareous rocks on the sea-coast.</i>&mdash;On
several of the sea-beaches, there are immense accumulations of
small, well-rounded particles of shells and corals, of white,
yellowish, and pink colours, interspersed with a few volcanic
particles. At the depth of a few feet, these are found cemented
together into stone, of which the softer varieties are used for
building; there are other varieties, both coarse and fine-grained,
too hard for this purpose: and I saw one mass divided into even
layers half an inch in thickness, which were so compact that when
struck with a hammer they rang like flint. It is believed by the
inhabitants, that the particles become united in the course of a
single year. The union is effected by calcareous matter; and in the
most compact varieties, each rounded particle of shell and volcanic
rock can be distinctly seen to be enveloped in a husk of pellucid
carbonate of lime. Extremely few perfect shells are embedded in
these agglutinated masses; and I have examined even a large
fragment under a microscope, without being able to discover the
least vestige of stri&aelig; or other marks of external form: this
shows how long each particle must have been rolled about, before
its turn came to be embedded and cemented.<sup>1</sup> One of the
most compact varieties, when placed in acid, was entirely
dissolved, with the exception of some flocculent animal matter; its
specific gravity was 2&middot;63. The specific gravity of ordinary
limestone varies from 2&middot;6 to 2&middot;75; pure Carrara
marble was found by Sir H. De la Beche<sup>2</sup> to be
2&middot;7. It is remarkable that these rocks of Ascension, formed
close to the surface, should be nearly as compact as marble, which
has undergone the action of heat and pressure in the plutonic
regions.</p>

<p>The great accumulation of loose calcareous particles, lying on
the beach near the Settlement, commences in the month of October,
moving towards the S.W., which, as I was informed by Lieutenant</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The eggs of the turtle being buried by the
parent, sometimes become enclosed in the solid rock. Mr. Lyell has
given a figure ("Principles of Geology," book iii, ch. 17) of some
eggs, containing the bones of young turtles, found thus
entombed.<br>

<p>Evans, is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the
currents. At this period the tidal rocks, at the S.W. end of the
beach, where the calcareous sand is accumulating, and round which
the currents sweep, become gradually coated with a calcareous
incrustation, half an inch in thickness. It is quite white,
compact, with some parts slightly spathose, and is firmly attached
to the rock. After a short time it gradually disappears, being
either redissolved, when the water is less charged with lime, or
more probably is mechanically abraded. Lieutenant Evans has
observed these facts, during the six years he has resided at
Ascension. The incrustation varies in thickness in different years:
in 1831 it was unusually thick. When I was there in July, there was
no remnant of the incrustation; but on a point of basalt, from
which the quarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous
freestone, the incrustation was perfectly preserved. Considering
the position of the tidal-rocks, and the period at which they
become coated, there can be no doubt that the movement and
disturbance of the vast accumulation of calcareous particles, many
of them being partially agglutinated together, cause the waves of
the sea to be so highly charged with carbonate of lime, that they
deposit it on the first objects against which they impinge. I have
been informed by Lieutenant Holland, R.N., that this incrustation
is formed on many parts of the coast, on most of which, I believe,
there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells.</p>

<p><i>A frondescent calcareous incrustation.</i>&mdash;In many
respects this is a singular deposit; it coats throughout the year
the tidal volcanic rocks, that project from the beaches composed of
broken shells. Its general appearance is well represented in Figure
5; but the fronds or discs, of which it is composed, are generally
so closely crowded together as to touch. These fronds have their
sinuous edges finely crenulated, and they project over their
pedestals or supports; their upper surfaces are either slightly
concave, or slightly convex; they are highly polished, and of a
dark grey or jet black colour; their form is irregular, generally
circular, and from the tenth of an inch to one inch and a half in
diameter; their thickness, or amount of their projection from the
rock on which they stand, varies much, about a quarter of an inch
being perhaps most usual. The fronds occasionally become more and
more convex, until they pass into botryoidal masses with their
summits fissured; when in this state, they are glossy and of an
intense black, so as to resemble some fused metallic substance. I
have shown the incrustation, both in this latter and in its
ordinary state to several geologists, but not one could conjecture
its origin, except that perhaps it was of volcanic nature!</p>

<p class="capt">An incrustation of calcareous and animal
matter,<br>
 coating the tidal-rocks at Ascension.</p>

<p>The substance forming the fronds has a very compact and often
almost crystalline fracture; the edges being translucent, and hard
enough easily to scratch calcareous spar. Under the blowpipe it
immediately becomes white, and emits a strong animal odour, like
that from fresh shells. It is chiefly composed of carbonate of
lime; when placed in muriatic acid it froths much, leaving a
residue of sulphate of lime, and of an oxide of iron, together with
a black powder, which is not soluble in heated acids. This latter
substance seems to be carbonaceous,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 200">page 200</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and is evidently the colouring matter. The sulphate of lime is
extraneous, and occurs in distinct, excessively minute, lamellar
plates, studded on the surface of the fronds, and embedded between
the fine layers of which they are composed; when a fragment is
heated in the blowpipe, these lamell&aelig; are immediately
rendered visible. The original outline of the fronds may often be
traced, either to a minute particle of shell fixed in a crevice of
the rock, or to several cemented together; these first become
deeply corroded, by the dissolving power of the waves, into sharp
ridges, and then are coated with successive layers of the glossy,
grey, calcareous incrustation. The inequalities of the primary
support affect the outline of every successive layer, in the same
manner as may often be seen in bezoar-stones, when an object like a
nail forms the centre of aggregation. The crenulated edges,
however, of the frond appear to be due to the corroding power of
the surf on its own deposit, alternating with fresh depositions. On
some smooth basaltic rocks on the coast of St. Jago, I found an
exceedingly thin layer of brown calcareous matter, which under a
lens presented a miniature likeness of the crenulated and polished
fronds of Ascension; in this case a basis was not afforded by any
projecting extraneous particles. Although the incrustation at
Ascension is persistent throughout the year; yet from the abraded
appearance of some parts, and from the fresh appearance of other
parts, the whole seems to undergo a round of decay and renovation,
due probably to changes in the form of the shifting beach, and
consequently in the action of the breakers: hence probably it is,
that the incrustation never acquires a great thickness. Considering
the position of the encrusted rocks in the midst of the calcareous
beach, together with its composition, I think there can be no doubt
that its origin is due to the dissolution and subsequent deposition
of the matter composing the rounded particles of shells and
corals.<sup>1</sup> From this source</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The selenite, as I have remarked is extraneous,
and must have been derived from the sea-water. It is an interesting
circumstance thus to find the waves of the ocean, sufficiently
charged with sulphate of lime, to deposit it on the rocks, against
which they dash every tide. Dr. Webster has described ("Voyage of
the <i>Chanticleer,</i>" vol. ii, p. 319) beds of gypsum and salt,
as much as two feet in thickness, left by the evaporation of the
spray on the rocks on the windward coast. Beautiful stalactites of
selenite, resembling in form those of carbonate of lime, are formed
near these beds. Amorphous masses of gypsum, also, occur in caverns
in the interior of the island; and at Cross Hill (an old crater) I
saw a considerable quantity of salt oozing from a pile of
scori&aelig;. In these latter cases, the salt and gypsum appear to
be volcanic products.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>it derives its animal matter, which is evidently the colouring
principle. The nature of the deposit, in its incipient stage, can
often be well seen upon a fragment of white shell, when jammed
between two of the fronds; it then appears exactly like the
thinnest wash of a pale grey varnish. Its darkness varies a little,
but the jet blackness of some of the fronds and of the botryoidal
masses seems due to the translucency of the successive grey layers.
There is, however, this singular circumstance, that when deposited
on the under side of ledges of rock or in fissures, it appears
always to be of a pale, pearly grey colour, even when of
considerable thickness: hence one is led to suppose, that an
abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark
colour, in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper
and exposed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca, which are
always dark, compared with their under surfaces and with the parts
habitually covered by the mantle of the animal. In this
circumstance,&mdash;in the immediate loss of colour and in the
odour emitted under the blowpipe,&mdash;in the degree of hardness
and translucency of the edges,&mdash;and in the beautiful polish of
the surface,<sup>1</sup> rivalling when in a fresh state that of
the finest Oliva, there is a striking analogy between this
inorganic incrustation and the shells of living molluscous
animals.<sup>2</sup> This appears to me to be an interesting
physiological fact.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. From the fact described in my "Journal of
Researches" of a coating of oxide of iron, deposited by a streamlet
on the rocks in its bed (like a nearly similar coating at the great
cataracts of the Orinoco and Nile), becoming finely polished where
the surf acts, I presume that the surf in this instance, also, is
the polishing agent.)<br>
2. In the section descriptive of St. Paul's Rocks, I have described
a glossy, pearly substance, which coats the rocks, and an allied
stalactitical incrustation from Ascension, the crust of which
resembles the enamel of teeth, but is hard enough to scratch
plate-glass. Both these substances contain animal matter, and seem
to have been derived from water in filtering through birds'
dung.<br>
3. Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described ("Philosophical
Transactions," 1836, p. 65) a singular "artificial substance,
resembling shell." It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly
polished, brown-coloured lamin&aelig;, possessing peculiar optical
properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first
prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly
in water. It is much softer, more transparent, and contains more
animal matter, than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we
here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and
animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell.</p>

<p><i>Singular laminated beds alternating with and passing into
obsidian.</i>&mdash;These beds occur within the trachytic district,
at the western base of Green Mountain, under which they dip at a
high inclination. They are only partially exposed, being covered up
by modern ejections; from this cause, I was unable to trace their
junction with the trachyte, or to discover whether they had flowed
as a stream of lava, or had been injected amidst the overlying
strata. There are three principal beds of obsidian, of which the
thickest forms the base of the section. The alternating stony
layers appear to me eminently curious, and shall be first
described, and afterwards their passage into the obsidian. They
have an extremely diversified appearance; five principal varieties
may be noticed, but these insensibly blend into each other by
endless gradations.</p>

<p>First.&mdash;A pale grey, irregularly and coarsely
laminated,<sup>1</sup> harsh-feeling rock, resembling clay-slate
which has been in contact with a trap-dike, and with a fracture of
about the same degree of crystalline structure. This rock, as well
as the following varieties, easily fuses into a pale glass. The
greater part is honeycombed with irregular, angular, cavities, so
that the whole has a curious appearance, and some fragments
resemble in a remarkable manner silicified logs of decayed wood.
This variety, especially where more compact, is often marked with
thin whitish streaks, which are either straight or wrap round, one
behind the other, the elongated carious hollows.</p>

<p>Secondly.&mdash;A bluish grey or pale brown, compact, heavy,
homogeneous stone, with an angular, uneven, earthy fracture;
viewed, however, under a lens of high power, the fracture is seen
to be distinctly crystalline, and even separate minerals can be
distinguished.</p>

<p>Thirdly.&mdash;A stone of the same kind with the last, but
streaked with numerous, parallel, slightly tortuous, white lines of
the thickness of hairs. These white lines are more crystalline than
the parts between them; and the stone splits along them: they
frequently expand into exceedingly thin cavities, which are often
only just perceptible with a lens. The matter forming the white
lines becomes better crystallised in these cavities, and Professor
Miller was fortunate enough, after several trials, to ascertain
that the white crystals, which are the largest, were of
quartz,<sup>2</sup> and that the minute green transparent needles
were augite, or, as they would more generally be called, diopside:
besides these crystals, there are some minute, dark specks without
a trace of</p>

<p class="fnote">1. This term is open to some misinterpretation, as
it may be applied both to rocks divided into lamin&aelig; of
exactly the same composition, and to layers firmly attached to each
other, with no fissile tendency, but composed of different
minerals, or of different shades of colour. The term "laminated,"
in this chapter, is applied in these latter senses; where a
homogeneous rock splits, as in the former sense, in a given
direction, like clay-slate, I have used the term "fissile."<br>
2. Professor Miller informs me that the crystals which he measured
had the faces <i>P, z, m</i> of the figure (147) given by Haidinger
in his Translation of Mohs; and he adds, that it is remarkable,
that none of them had the slightest trace of faces <i>r</i> of the
regular six-sided prism.</p>

<p>crystalline, and some fine, white, granular, crystalline matter
which is probably feldspar. Minute fragments of this rock are
easily fusible.</p>

<p>Fourthly.&mdash;A compact crystalline rock, banded in straight
lines with innumerable layers of white and grey shades of colour,
varying in width from the thirtieth to the two-hundredth of an
inch; these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar, and
they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar, which
are placed lengthways; they are also thickly studded with
microscopically minute, amorphous, black specks, which are placed
in rows, either standing separately, or more frequently united, two
or three or several together, into black lines, thinner than a
hair. When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe, the black
specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads, which become
magnetic,&mdash;characters that apply to no common mineral except
hornblende or augite. With the black specks there are mingled some
others of a red colour, which are magnetic before being heated, and
no doubt are oxide of iron. Round two little cavities, in a
specimen of this variety, I found the black specks aggregated into
minute crystals, appearing like those of augite or hornblende, but
too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer; in the
specimen, also, I could distinguish amidst the crystalline
feldspar, grains, which had the aspect of quartz. By trying with a
parallel ruler, I found that the thin grey layers and the black
hair-like lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each
other. It is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous
grey rocks to these striped varieties, or indeed the character of
the different layers in the same specimen, without feeling
convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the
crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect
aggregation of diffused matter, into the black and red specks of
hornblende and oxide of iron.</p>

<p>Fifthly.&mdash;A compact heavy rock, not laminated, with an
irregular, angular, highly crystalline, fracture; it abounds with
distinct crystals of glassy feldspar, and the crystalline
feldspathic base is mottled with a black mineral, which on the
weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into small crystals,
some perfect, but the greater number imperfect. I showed this
specimen to an experienced geologist, and asked him what it was; he
answered, as I think every one else would have done, that it was a
primitive greenstone. The weathered surface, also, of the banded
variety in figure No. 4, strikingly resembles a worn fragment of
finely laminated gneiss.</p>

<p>These five varieties, with many intermediate ones, pass and
repass into each other. As the compact varieties are quite
subordinate to the others, the whole may be considered as laminated
or striped. The lamin&aelig;, to sum up their characteristics, are
either quite straight, or slightly tortuous, or convoluted; they
are all parallel to each other, and to the intercalating strata of
obsidian; they are generally of extreme thinness; they consist
either of an apparently homogeneous, compact rock, striped with
different shades of grey and brown colours, or of crystalline
feldspathic layers in a more or less perfect state of purity, and
of different thicknesses, with distinct crystals of glassy
feldspar</p>

<p>placed lengthways, or of very thin layers chiefly composed of
minute crystals of quartz and augite, or composed of black and red
specks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron, either not
crystallised or imperfectly so. After having fully described the
obsidian, I shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks
of the trachytic series.</p>

<p>The passage of the foregoing beds into the strata of glassy
obsidian is effected in several ways: first, angulo-modular masses
of obsidian, both large and small, abruptly appear disseminated in
a slaty, or in an amorphous, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, with
a somewhat pearly fracture. Secondly, small irregular nodules of
the obsidian, either standing separately, or united into thin
layers, seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness,
alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock,
which is striped with the finest parallel zones of colour, like an
agate, and which sometimes passes into the nature of pitchstone;
the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally
filled by soft white matter, resembling pumiceous ashes. Thirdly,
the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into an
angulo-concretionary mass of obsidian. Such masses (as well as the
small nodules) of obsidian are of a pale green colour, and are
generally streaked with different shades of colour, parallel to the
lamin&aelig; of the surrounding rock; they likewise generally
contain minute white sph&aelig;rulites, of which half is sometimes
embedded in a zone of one shade of colour, and half in a zone of
another shade. The obsidian assumes its jet black colour and
perfectly conchoidal fracture, only when in large masses; but even
in these, on careful examination and on holding the specimens in
different lights, I could generally distinguish parallel streaks of
different shades of darkness.</p>

sph&aelig;rulites,<br>
 intersecting two other similar layers: the whole represented<br>
of nearly the natural size.</p>

<p>One of the commonest transitional rocks deserves in several
respects a further description. It is of a very complicated nature,
and consists of numerous thin, slightly tortuous layers of a
pale-coloured feldspathic stone, often passing into an imperfect
pitchstone, alternating with layers formed of numberless little
globules of two varieties of obsidian, and of two kinds of
sph&aelig;rulites, embedded in a soft or in a hard pearly base. The
sph&aelig;rulites are either white and translucent, or dark brown
and opaque; the former are quite spherical, of small size, and
distinctly radiated from their centre. The dark brown
sph&aelig;rulites are less perfectly round, and vary in diameter
from the twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch; when broken they
exhibit towards their centres, which are whitish, an obscure
radiating structure; two of them when united sometimes have only
one central point of radiation; there is occasionally a trace of or
a hollow crevice in their centres. They stand either separately, or
are united two or three or many together into irregular groups, or
more commonly into layers, parallel to the stratification of the
mass. This union in many cases is so perfect, that the two sides of
the layer thus formed, are quite even; and these layers, as they
become less brown and opaque, cannot be distinguished from the
alternating layers of the pale-coloured feldspathic stone. The
sph&aelig;rulites, when not united, are generally compressed in the
plane of the lamination of the mass; and in this same plane, they
are often marked internally, by zones of different</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 205">page 205</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>shades of colour, and externally by small ridges and furrows. In
the upper part of figure No. 6, the sph&aelig;rulites with the
parallel ridges and furrows are represented on an enlarged scale,
but they are not well executed; and in the lower part, their usual
manner of grouping is shown. In another specimen, a thin layer
formed of the brown sph&aelig;rulites closely united together,
intersects, as represented in figure No. 7, a layer of similar
composition; and after running for a short space in a slightly
curved line, again intersects it, and likewise a second layer lying
a little way beneath that first intersected. The small nodules also
of obsidian are sometimes externally marked with ridges and
furrows, parallel to the lamination of the mass, but always less
plainly than the sph&aelig;rulites. These obsidian nodules are
generally angular, with their edges blunted: they are often
impressed with the form of the adjoining sph&aelig;rulites, than
which they are always larger; the separate nodules seldom appear to
have drawn each other out by exerting a mutually attractive force.
Had I not found in some cases, a distinct centre of attraction in
these nodules of obsidian, I should have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 206">page 206</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>been led to have considered them as residuary matter, left
during the formation of the pearlstone, in which they are embedded,
and of the sph&aelig;rulitic globules.</p>

<p>The sph&aelig;rulites and the little nodules of obsidian in
these rocks so closely resemble, in general form and structure,
concretions in sedimentary deposits, that one is at once tempted to
attribute to them an analogous origin. They resemble ordinary
concretions in the following respects: in their external
form,&mdash;in the union of two or three, or of several, into an
irregular mass, or into an even-sided layer,&mdash;in the
occasional intersection of one such layer by another, as in the
case of chalk-flints,&mdash;in the presence of two or three kinds
of nodules, often close together, in the same basis,&mdash;in their
fibrous, radiating structure, with occasional hollows in their
centres,&mdash;in the co-existence of a laminary, concretionary,
and radiating structure, as is so well developed in the concretions
of magnesian limestone, described by Professor
Sedgwick.<sup>1</sup> Concretions in sedimentary deposits, it is
known, are due to the separation from the surrounding mass of the
whole or part of some mineral substance, and its aggregation round
certain points of attraction. Guided by this fact, I have
endeavoured to discover whether obsidian and the sph&aelig;rulites
(to which may be added marekanite and pearlstone, both of them
occurring in nodular concretions in the trachytic series) differ in
their constituent parts, from the minerals generally composing
trachytic rocks. It appears from three analyses, that obsidian
contains on an average 76 per cent of silica; from one analysis,
that sph&aelig;rulites contain 79&middot;12; from two, that
marekanite contains 79&middot;25; and from two other analyses, that
pearlstone contains 75&middot;62 of silica.<sup>2</sup> Now, the
constituent parts of trachyte, as far as they can be distinguished
consist of feldspar, containing 65&middot;21 of silica; or of
albite, containing 69&middot;09; of hornblende, containing
55&middot;27,<sup>3</sup> and of oxide of iron: so that the
foregoing glassy concretionary substances all contain a larger
proportion of silica than that occurring in ordinary feldspathic or
trachytic rocks. D'Aubuisson,<sup>4</sup> also, has remarked on the
large proportion of silica compared with alumina, in six analyses
of obsidian and pearlstone given in Brongniart's "Mineralogy."
Hence I conclude, that the foregoing concretions have been formed
by a process of aggregation, strictly analogous to that which takes
place in aqueous deposits, acting chiefly on the silica, but
likewise on some of the other elements of the surrounding mass, and
thus producing the different concretionary varieties. From the
well-known effects of rapid cooling<sup>5</sup> in giving
glassiness of</p>

<p>texture, it is probably necessary that the entire mass, in cases
like that of Ascension, should have cooled at a certain rate; but
considering the repeated and complicated alterations of nodules and
thin layers of a glassy texture with other layers quite stony or
crystalline, all within the space of a few feet or even inches, it
is hardly possible that they could have cooled at different rates,
and thus have acquired their different textures.</p>

<p>The natural sph&aelig;rulites in these rocks<sup>1</sup> very
closely resemble those produced in glass, when slowly cooled. In
some fine specimens of partially devitrified glass, in the
possession of Mr. Stokes, the sph&aelig;rulites are united into
straight layers with even sides, parallel to each other, and to one
of the outer surfaces, exactly as in the obsidian. These layers
sometimes interbranch and form loops; but I did not see any case of
actual intersection. They form the passage from the perfectly
glassy portions, to those nearly homogeneous and stony, with only
an obscure concretionary structure. In the same specimen, also,
sph&aelig;rulites differing slightly in colour and in structure,
occur embedded close together. Considering these facts, it is some
confirmation of the view above given of the concretionary origin of
the obsidian and natural sph&aelig;rulites, to find that M.
Dartigues,<sup>2</sup> in his curious paper on this subject,
attributes the production of sph&aelig;rulites in glass, to the
different ingredients obeying their own laws of attraction and
becoming aggregated. He is led to believe that this takes place,
from the difficulty in remelting sph&aelig;rulitic glass, without
the whole be first thoroughly pounded and mixed together; and
likewise from the fact, that the change takes place most readily in
glass composed of many ingredients. In confirmation of M.
Dartigues' view, I may remark, that M. Fleuriau de
Bellevue<sup>3</sup> found that the sph&aelig;rulitic portions of
devitrified glass were acted on both by nitric acid and under the
blowpipe, in a different manner from the compact paste in which
they were embedded.</p>

<p><i>Comparison of the obsidian beds and alternating strata of

<p class="fnote">1. I do not know whether it is generally known,
that bodies having exactly the same appearance as
sph&aelig;rulites, sometimes occur in agates. Mr. Robert Brown
showed me in an agate, formed within a cavity in a piece of
silicified wood, some little specks, which were only just visible
to the naked eye: these specks, when placed by him under a lens of
high power, presented a beautiful appearance: they were perfectly
circular, and consisted of the finest fibres of a brown colour,
radiating with great exactness from a common centre. These little
radiating stars are occasionally intersected, and portions are
quite cut off by the fine, ribbon-like zones of colour in the
agate. In the obsidian of Ascension, the halves of a
sph&aelig;rulite often lie in different zones of colour, but they
are not cut off by them, as in the agate.<br>

<p>Mexico and Peru,<sup>1</sup> and likewise the descriptions given
by several authors<sup>2</sup> of the trachytic regions in the
Italian islands, agree with my observations at Ascension. Many
passages might have been transferred without alteration from the
works of the above authors, and would have been applicable to this
island. They all agree in the laminated and stratified character of
the whole series; and Humboldt speaks of some of the beds of
obsidian being ribboned like jasper.<sup>3</sup> They all agree in
the nodular or concretionary character of the obsidian, and of the
passage of these nodules into layers. They all refer to the
repeated alterations, often in undulatory planes, of glassy,
pearly, stony, and crystalline layers: the crystalline layers,
however, seem to be much more perfectly developed at Ascension,
than in the above-named countries. Humboldt compares some of the
stony beds, when viewed from a distance, to strata of a schistose
sandstone. Sph&aelig;rulites are described as occurring abundantly
in all cases; and they everywhere seem to mark the passage, from
the perfectly glassy to the stony and crystalline beds. Beudant's
account<sup>4</sup> of his "perlite lithoide globulaire" in every,
even the most trifling particular, might have been written for the
little brown sph&aelig;rulitic globules of the rocks of
Ascension.</p>

<p>From the close similarity in so many respects, between the
obsidian formations of Hungary, Mexico, Peru, and of some of the
Italian islands, with that of Ascension, I can hardly doubt that in
all these cases, the obsidian and the sph&aelig;rulites owe their
origin to a concretionary aggregation of the silica, and of some of
the other constituent elements, taking place whilst the liquified
mass cooled at a certain required rate. It is, however, well-known,
that in several places, obsidian has flowed in streams like lava;
for instance, at Teneriffe, at the Lipari Islands, and at
Iceland.<sup>5</sup> In these cases, the superficial parts are the
most</p>

3. In Mr. Stokes' fine collection of obsidians from Mexico, I
observe that the sph&aelig;rulites are generally much larger than
those of Ascension; they are generally white, opaque, and are
united into distinct layers: there are many singular varieties,
different from any at Ascension. The obsidians are finely zoned, in
quite straight or curved lines, with exceedingly slight differences
of tint, of cellularity, and of more or less perfect degrees of
glassiness. Tracing some of the less perfectly glassy zones, they
are seen to become studded with minute white sph&aelig;rulites,
which become more and more numerous, until at last they unite and
form a distinct layer: on the other hand, at Ascension, only the
brown sph&aelig;rulites unite and form layers; the white ones
always being irregularly disseminated. Some specimens at the
Geological Society, said to belong to an obsidian formation from
Mexico, have an earthy fracture, and are divided in the finest
parallel lamin&aelig;, by specks of a black mineral, like the
augitic or hornblendic specks in the rocks at Ascension.<br>

<p>perfectly glassy, the obsidian passing at the depth of a few
feet into an opaque stone. In an analysis by Vauquelin of a
specimen of obsidian from Hecla, which probably flowed as lava, the
proportion of silica is nearly the same as in the nodular or
concretionary obsidian from Mexico. It would be interesting to
ascertain, whether the opaque interior portions and the superficial
glassy coating contained the same proportional constituent parts:
we know from M. Dufr&eacute;noy<sup>1</sup> that the exterior and
interior parts of the same stream of lava sometimes differ
considerably in their composition. Even should the whole body of
the stream of obsidian turn out to be similarly composed with
nodular obsidian, it would only be necessary, in accordance with
the foregoing facts, to suppose that lava in these instances had
been erupted with its ingredients mixed in the same proportion, as
in the concretionary obsidian.</p>

<br>
<center><i>Lamination of volcanic rocks of the trachytic
series.</i></center>

<p>We have seen that, in several and widely distant countries, the
strata alternating with beds of obsidian, are highly laminated. The
nodules, also, both large and small, of the obsidian, are zoned
with different shades of colour; and I have seen a specimen from
Mexico in Mr. Stokes' collection, with its external surface
weathered<sup>2</sup> into ridges and furrows, corresponding with
the zones of different degrees of glassiness: Humboldt,<sup>3</sup>
moreover, found on the Peak of Teneriffe, a stream of obsidian
divided by very thin, alternating, layers of pumice. Many other
lavas of the feldspathic series are laminated; thus, masses of
common trachyte at Ascension are divided by fine earthy lines,
along which the rock splits, separating thin layers of slightly
different shades of colour; the greater number, also, of the
embedded crystals of glassy feldspar are placed lengthways in the
same direction. Mr. P. Scrope<sup>4</sup> has described a
remarkable columnar trachyte in the Panza Islands, which seems to
have been injected into an overlying mass of trachytic
conglomerate: it is striped with zones, often of extreme tenuity,
of different textures and colours; the harder and darker zones
appearing to contain a larger proportion of silica. In another part
of the island, there are layers of pearlstone and pitchstone, which
in many respects resemble those of Ascension. The zones in the
columnar trachyte are generally contorted; they extend
uninterruptedly for a great length in a vertical direction, and
apparently parallel to the walls of the dike-like mass. Von
Buch<sup>5</sup> has described at Teneriffe, a stream of lava</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "M&eacute;moires pour servir a une Descript.
G&eacute;olog. de la France," tome iv, p. 371.<br>
2. MacCulloch states ("Classification of Rocks," p. 531), that the
exposed surfaces of the pitchstone dikes in Arran are furrowed
"with undulating lines, resembling certain varieties of marbled
paper, and which evidently result from some corresponding
difference of laminar structure."<br>

<p>containing innumerable thin, plate-like crystals of feldspar,
which are arranged like white threads, one behind the other, and
which mostly follow the same direction. Dolomieu<sup>1</sup> also
states, that the grey lavas of the modern cone of Vulcano, which
have a vitreous texture, are streaked with parallel white lines: he
further describes a solid pumice-stone which possesses a fissile
structure, like that of certain micaceous schists. Phonolite, which
I may observe is often, if not always, an injected rock, also,
often has a fissile structure; this is generally due to the
parallel position of the embedded crystals of feldspar, but
sometimes, as at Fernando Noronha, seems to be nearly independent
of their presence.<sup>2</sup> From these facts we see, that
various rocks of the feldspathic series have either a laminated or
fissile structure, and that it occurs both in masses which have
injected into overlying strata, and in others which have flowed as
streams of lava.</p>

<p>The lamin&aelig; of the beds, alternating with the obsidian at
Ascension, dip at a high angle under the mountain, at the base of
which they are situated; and they do not appear as if they had been
inclined by violence. A high inclination is common to these beds in
Mexico, Peru, and in some of the Italian islands:<sup>3</sup> on
the other hand, in Hungary, the layers are horizontal; the
lamin&aelig;, also, of some of the lava-streams above referred to,
as far as I can understand the descriptions given of them, appear
to be highly inclined or vertical. I doubt whether in any of these
cases, the lamin&aelig; have been tilted into their present
position; and in some instances, as in that of the trachyte
described by Mr. Scrope, it is almost certain that they have been
originally formed with a high inclination. In many of these cases,
there is evidence that the mass of liquified rock has moved in the
direction of the lamin&aelig;. At Ascension, many of the air-cells
have a drawn out appearance, and are crossed by coarse semi-glassy
fibres, in the direction of the lamin&aelig;; and some of the
layers, separating the sph&aelig;rulitic globules, have a scored
appearance, as if produced by the grating of the globules. I have
seen a specimen of zoned obsidian from Mexico, in Mr. Stokes'
collection, with the surfaces of the best-defined layers streaked
or furrowed with parallel lines; and these lines or streaks
precisely resembled those, produced on the surface of a mass of
artificial glass by its having been poured out of a vessel.

2. In this case, and in that of the fissile pumice-stone, the
structure is very different from that in the foregoing cases, where
the lamin&aelig; consist of alternate layers of different
composition or texture. In some sedimentary formations, however,
which apparently are homogeneous and fissile, as in glossy
clay-slate, there is reason to believe, according to D'Aubuisson,
that the lamin&aelig; are really due to excessively thin,
alternating, layers of mica.<br>

<p>described other cavities behind fragments embedded in his
laminated trachyte, and which he supposes to have been produced
during the movement of the mass.<sup>1</sup> From such facts, most
authors have attributed the lamination of these volcanic rocks to
their movement whilst liquified. Although it is easy to perceive,
why each separate air-cell, or each fibre in
pumice-stone,<sup>2</sup> should be drawn out in the direction of
the moving mass; it is by no means at first obvious why such
air-cells and fibres should be arranged by the movement, in the
same planes, in lamin&aelig; absolutely straight and parallel to
each other, and often of extreme tenuity; and still less obvious is
it, why such layers should come to be of slightly different
composition and of different textures.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to make out the cause of the lamination of these
igneous feldspathic rocks, let us return to the facts so minutely
described at Ascension. We there see, that some of the thinnest
layers are chiefly formed by numerous, exceedingly minute, though
perfect, crystals of different minerals; that other layers are
formed by the union of different kinds of concretionary globules,
and that the layers thus formed, often cannot be distinguished from
the ordinary feldspathic and pitchstone layers, composing a large
portion of the entire mass. The fibrous radiating structure of the
sph&aelig;rulites seems, judging from many analogous cases, to
connect the concretionary and crystalline forces: the separate
crystals, also, of feldspar all lie in the same parallel
planes.<sup>3</sup> These allied forces, therefore, have played an
important part in the lamination of the mass, but they cannot be
considered the primary force; for the several kinds of nodules,
both the smallest and largest, are internally zoned with
excessively fine shades of colour, parallel to the lamination of
the whole; and many of them are, also, externally marked in the
same direction with parallel ridges and furrows, which have not
been produced by weathering.</p>

<p>Some of the finest streaks of colour in the stony layers,
alternating with the obsidian, can be distinctly seen to be due to
an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals. The
extent to which the minerals have crystallised can, also, be
distinctly seen to be connected</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "Geological Transactions," vol. ii (second
series), p. 200 etc. These embedded fragments, in some instances,
consist of the laminated trachyte broken off and "enveloped in
those parts, which still remained liquid." Beudant, also,
frequently refers in his great work on "Hungary" (tome iii, p.
386), to trachytic rocks, irregularly spotted with fragments of the
same varieties, which in other parts form the parallel ribbons. In
these cases, we must suppose, that after part of the molten mass
had assumed a laminated structure, a fresh irruption of lava broke
up the mass, and involved fragments, and that subsequently the
whole became relaminated.<br>
2. Dolomieu's "Voyage," p. 64.<br>
3. The formation, indeed, of a large crystal of any mineral in a
rock of mixed composition implies an aggregation of the requisite
atoms, allied to concretionary action. The cause of the crystals of
feldspar in these rocks of Ascension, being all placed lengthways,
is probably the same with that which elongates and flattens all the
brown sph&aelig;rulitic globules (which behave like feldspar under
the blowpipe) in this same direction.</p>

<p>with the greater or less size, and with the number, of the
minute, flattened, crenulated air-cavities or fissures. Numerous
facts, as in the case of geodes, and of cavities in silicified
wood, in primary rocks, and in veins, show that crystallisation is
much favoured by space. Hence, I conclude, that, if in a mass of
cooling volcanic rock, any cause produced in parallel planes a
number of minute fissures or zones of less tension (which from the
pent-up vapours would often be expanded into crenulated
air-cavities), the crystallisation of the constituent parts, and
probably the formation of concretions, would be superinduced or
much favoured in such planes; and thus, a laminated structure of
the kind we are here considering would be generated.</p>

<p>That some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in
volcanic rocks, during their consolidation, we must admit in the
case of the thin alternate layers of obsidian and pumice described
by Humboldt, and of the small, flattened, crenulated air-cells in
the laminated rocks of Ascension; for on no other principle can we
conceive why the confined vapours should through their expansion
form air-cells or fibres in separate, parallel planes, instead of
irregularly throughout the mass. In Mr. Stokes' collection, I have
seen a beautiful example of this structure, in a specimen of
obsidian from Mexico, which is shaded and zoned, like the finest
agate, with numerous, straight, parallel layers, more or less
opaque and white, or almost perfectly glassy; the degree of opacity
and glassiness depending on the number of microscopically minute,
flattened air-cells; in this case, it is scarcely possible to doubt
but that the mass, to which the fragment belonged, must have been
subjected to some, probably prolonged, action, causing the tension
slightly to vary in the successive planes.</p>

<p>Several causes appear capable of producing zones of different
tension, in masses semi-liquified by heat. In a fragment of
devitrified glass, I have observed layers of sph&aelig;rulites
which appeared, from the manner in which they were abruptly bent,
to have been produced by the simple contraction of the mass in the
vessel, in which it cooled. In certain dikes on Mount Etna,
described by M. Elie de Beaumont,<sup>1</sup> as bordered by
alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock, one is led to
suppose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata,
which originally produced the fissures, continued whilst the
injected rock remained fluid. Guided, however, by Professor
Forbes'<sup>2</sup> clear description of the zoned structure of
glacier-ice, far the most probable explanation of the laminated
structure of these feldspathic rocks appears to be, that they have
been stretched whilst slowly flowing onwards in a pasty
condition,<sup>3</sup> in precisely the same manner as Professor
Forbes believes, that the ice of moving glaciers is stretched and
fissured. In both cases,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "M&eacute;m. pour servir," etc., tome iv, p.
131.<br>
2. <i>Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,</i> 1842, p. 350.<br>
3. I presume that this is nearly the same explanation which Mr.
Scrope had in his mind, when he speaks ("Geolog. Transact.," vol.
ii, second series, p. 228) of the ribboned structure of his
trachytic rocks, having arisen, from "a linear extension of the
mass, while in a state of imperfect liquidity, coupled with a
concretionary process."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 213">page 213</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the zones may be compared to those in the finest agates; in
both, they extend in the direction in which the mass has flowed,
and those exposed on the surface are generally vertical: in the
ice, the porous lamin&aelig; are rendered distinct by the
subsequent congelation of infiltrated water, in the stony
feldspathic lavas, by subsequent crystalline and concretionary
action. The fragment of glassy obsidian in Mr. Stokes' collection,
which is zoned with minute air-cells must strikingly resemble,
judging from Professor Forbes' descriptions, a fragment of the
zoned ice; and if the rate of cooling and nature of the mass had
been favourable to its crystallisation or to concretionary action,
we should here have had the finest parallel zones of different
composition and texture. In glaciers, the lines of porous ice and
of minute crevices seem to be due to an incipient stretching,
caused by the central parts of the frozen stream moving faster than
the sides and bottom, which are retarded by friction: hence in
glaciers of certain forms and towards the lower end of most
glaciers, the zones become horizontal. May we venture to suppose
that in the feldspathic lavas with horizontal lamin&aelig;, we see
an analogous case? All geologists, who have examined trachytic
regions, have come to the conclusion, that the lavas of this series
have possessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity; and as it is
evident that only matter thus characterised would be subject to
become fissured and to be formed into zones of different tensions,
in the manner here supposed, we probably see the reason why augitic
lavas, which appear generally to have possessed a high degree of
fluidity, are not,<sup>1</sup> like the feldspathic lavas, divided
into lamin&aelig; of different composition and texture. Moreover,
in the augitic series, there never appears to be any tendency to
concretionary action, which we have seen plays an important part in
the lamination of rocks, of the trachytic series, or at least in
rendering that structure apparent.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the explanation here advanced of the
laminated structure of the rocks of the trachytic series, I venture
to call the attention of geologists to the simple fact, that in a
body of rock at Ascension, undoubtedly of volcanic origin, layers
often of extreme tenuity, quite straight, and parallel to each
other, have been produced;&mdash;some composed of distinct crystals
of quartz and diopside, mingled with amorphous augitic specks and
granular feldspar,&mdash;others entirely composed of these black
augitic specks, with granules of oxide of iron,&mdash;and lastly,
others formed of crystalline feldspar, in a more or less perfect
state of purity, together with numerous crystals of feldspar,
placed lengthways. At this island, there is reason to believe, and
in some analogous cases, it is certainly known, that the
lamin&aelig; have originally been formed with their present high
inclination. Facts of this nature are manifestly of importance,
with relation to the structural</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Basaltic lavas, and many other rocks, are not
unfrequently divided into thick lamin&aelig; or plates, of the same
composition, which are either straight or curved; these being
crossed by vertical lines of fissure, sometimes become united into
columns. This structure seems related, in its origin, to that by
which many rocks, both igneous and sedimentary, become traversed by
parallel systems of fissures.</p>

<p>The whole island is of volcanic origin; its circumference,
according to Beatson,<sup>1</sup> is about twenty-eight miles. The
central and largest part consists of rocks of a feldspathic nature,
generally decomposed to an extraordinary degree; and when in this
state, presenting a singular assemblage of alternating, red,
purple, brown, yellow, and white, soft, argillaceous beds. From the
shortness of our visit, I did not examine these beds with care;
some of them, especially those of the white, yellow, and brown
shades, originally existed as streams of lava, but the greater
number were probably ejected in the form of scori&aelig; and ashes:
other beds of a purple tint, porphyritic with crystal-shaped
patches of a white, soft substance, which are now unctuous, and
yield, like wax, a polished streak to the nail, seem once to have
existed as solid claystone-porphyries: the red argillaceous beds
generally have a brecciated structure, and no doubt have been
formed by the decomposition of scori&aelig;. Several extensive
streams, however, belonging to this series, retain their stony
character; these are either of a blackish-green colour, with minute
acicular crystals of feldspar, or of a very pale tint, and almost
composed of minute, often scaly, crystals of feldspar, abounding
with microscopical black specks; they are generally compact and
laminated; others, however, of similar composition, are cellular
and somewhat decomposed. None of these rocks contain large crystals
of feldspar, or have the harsh fracture peculiar to trachyte. These
feldspathic lavas and tuffs are the uppermost or those last
erupted; innumerable dikes, however, and great masses of molten
rock, have subsequently been injected into them. They converge, as
they rise, towards the central curved ridge, of which one point
attains the elevation of 2,700 feet. This ridge is the highest land
in the island; and it once formed the northern rim of a great
crater, whence the lavas of this series flowed: from its ruined
condition, from the southern half having been removed, and from the
violent dislocation which the whole island has undergone, its
structure is rendered very obscure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Basaltic series.</i>&mdash;The margin of the island is formed
by a rude circle of great, black, stratified, ramparts of basalt,
dipping seaward, and worn into cliffs, which are often nearly
perpendicular, and vary in height from a few hundred feet to two
thousand. This circle, or rather horse-shoe shaped ring, is open to
the south, and is breached by several other wide spaces. Its rim or
summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining
inland country; and the more recent feldspathic lavas, sloping down
from the central heights, generally abut against and overlap its
inner margin; on the north-western side of the island, however,
they appear (judging from a distance) to have flowed over and
concealed portions of it. In some parts, where the basaltic ring
has been breached, and the black ramparts stand detached, the
feldspathic lavas have passed between them, and now overhang the
sea-coast in lofty cliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour
and thinly stratified; they are generally highly vesicular, but
occasionally compact; some of them contain numerous crystals of
glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron; others abound
with crystals of augite and grains of olivine. The vesicles are
frequently lined with minute crystals (of chabasie?) and even
become amygdaloidal with them. The streams are separated from each
other by cindery matter, or by a bright red, friable, saliferous
tuff, which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous
deposition; and sometimes it has an obscure, concretionary
structure. The rocks of this basaltic series occur nowhere except
near the coast. In most volcanic districts the trachytic lavas are
of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we see, that a great
pile of rock, closely related in composition to the trachytic
family, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata: the
number, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite,
with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps
some tendency to a return to the more usual order of
superposition.</p>

<p><i>Basal submarine lavas.</i>&mdash;The lavas of this basal
series lie immediately beneath both the basaltic and feldspathic
rocks. According to Mr. Seale,<sup>1</sup> they may be seen at
intervals on the sea-beach round the entire island. In the sections
which I examined, their nature varied much; some of the strata
abound with crystals of augite; others are of a brown colour,
either laminated or in a rubbly condition; and many parts are
highly amygdaloidal with calcareous matter. The successive sheets
are either closely united together, or are separated from each
other by beds of scoriaceous rock and of laminated tuff, frequently
containing well-rounded fragments. The interstices of these beds
are filled with gypsum and salt; the gypsum also sometimes
occurring in thin layers. From the large quantity of these two
substances, from the presence of rounded pebbles in the tuffs, and
from the abundant amygdaloids, I cannot doubt that these basal
volcanic strata flowed beneath the sea. This remark ought perhaps
to be extended to a part of the superincumbent basaltic rocks; but
on this point, I was not able to obtain clear evidence. The</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 216">page 216</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>strata of the basal series, whenever I examined them, were
intersected by an extraordinary number of dikes.</p>

<p><i>Flagstaff Hill and the Barn.</i>&mdash;I will now describe
some of the more remarkable sections, and will commence with these
two hills, which form the principal external feature on the
north-eastern side of the island. The square, angular outline, and
black colour of the Barn, at once show that it belongs to the
basaltic series; whilst the smooth, conical figure, and the varied
bright tints of Flagstaff Hill, render it equally clear, that it is
composed of the softened, feldspathic rocks. These two lofty hills
are connected (as is shown in figure No. 8) by a sharp ridge, which
is composed of the rubbly lavas of the basal series. The strata of
this ridge dip westward, the inclination becoming less and less
towards the Flagstaff; and the upper feldspathic strata of this
hill can be seen, though with some difficulty, to dip conformably
to the W.S.W. Close to the Barn, the strata of the ridge are nearly
vertical, but are much obscured by innumerable dikes; under this
hill, they probably change from being vertical into being inclined
into an opposite direction; for the upper or basaltic strata, which
are about eight hundred or one thousand feet in thickness, are
inclined north-eastward, at an angle between thirty and forty
degrees.</p>

<p class="capt">The double lines represent the basaltic strata; the
single, the basal submarine strata;<br>
the dotted, the upper feldspathic strata; the dikes are shaded
transversely.</p>

<p>This ridge, and likewise the Barn and Flagstaff Hills, are
interlaced by dikes, many of which preserve a remarkable
parallelism in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction. The dikes chiefly
consist of a rock, porphyritic with large crystals of augite;
others are formed of a fine-grained and brown- coloured trap. Most
of these dikes are coated by a glossy layer,<sup>1</sup> from one
to two-tenths of an inch in thickness, which, unlike true
pitchstone, fuses into a black enamel; this layer is evidently
analogous to the glossy superficial coating of many lava streams.
The dikes can often be followed for great lengths both horizontally
and vertically, and</p>

<p class="fnote">1. This circumstance has been observed (Lyell,
"Principles of Geology," vol. iv, chap. x, p. 9) in the dikes of
the Atrio del Cavallo, but apparently it is not of very common
occurrence. Sir G. Mackenzie, however, states (p. 372, "Travels in
Iceland") that all the veins in Iceland have a "black vitreous
coating on their sides." Captain Carmichael, speaking of the dikes
in Tristan d'Acunha, a volcanic island in the Southern Atlantic,
says ("Linn&aelig;an Transactions," vol. xii, p. 485) that their
sides, "where they come in contact with the rocks, are invariably
in a semi-vitrified state."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 217">page 217</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>they seem to preserve a nearly uniform thickness:<sup>1</sup>
Mr. Seale states, that one near the Barn, in a height of 1,260
feet, decreases in width only four inches,&mdash;from nine feet at
the bottom, to eight feet and eight inches at the top. On the
ridge, the dikes appear to have been guided in their course, to a
considerable degree, by the alternating soft and hard strata: they
are often firmly united to the harder strata, and they preserve
their parallelism for such great lengths, that in very many
instances it was impossible to conjecture, which of the beds were
dikes, and which streams of lava. The dikes, though so numerous on
this ridge, are even more numerous in the valleys a little south of
it, and to a degree I never saw equalled anywhere else: in these
valleys they extend in less regular lines, covering the ground with
a network, like a spider's web, and with some parts of the surface
even appearing to consist wholly of dikes, interlaced by other
dikes.</p>

<p>From the complexity produced by the dikes, from the high
inclination and anticlinal dip of the strata of the basal series,
which are overlaid, at the opposite ends of the short ridge, by two
great masses of different ages and of different composition, I am
not surprised that this singular section has been misunderstood. It
has even been supposed to form part of a crater; but so far is this
from having been the case, that the summit of Flagstaff Hill once
formed the lower extremity of a sheet of lava and ashes, which were
erupted from the central, crateriform ridge. Judging from the slope
of the contemporaneous streams in an adjoining and undisturbed part
of the island, the strata of the Flagstaff Hill must have been
upturned at least twelve hundred feet, and probably much more, for
the great truncated dikes on its summit show that it has been
largely denuded. The summit of this hill now nearly equals in
height the crateriform ridge; and before having been denuded, it
was probably higher than this ridge, from which it is separated by
a broad and much lower tract of country; we here, therefore, see
that the lower extremities of a set of lava-streams have been
tilted up to as great a height as, or perhaps greater height than,
the crater, down the flanks of which they originally flowed. I
believe that dislocations on so grand a scale are extremely
rare<sup>2</sup> in volcanic districts. The formation of such
numbers of dikes in this part of the island shows that the surface
must here have been stretched to a quite extraordinary degree: this
stretching, on the ridge between Flagstaff and Barn Hills, probably
took place subsequently (though perhaps immediately so) to the
strata being tilted; for had the strata at that time extended
horizontally, they would in all probability have been fissured and
injected transversely, instead of in the planes of their
stratification. Although the space between the Barn and Flagstaff
Hill presents a distinct anticlinal line extending north and south,
and though most of the dikes range with much regularity in the same
line, nevertheless, at only a mile due south of the ridge the
strata lie undisturbed. Hence the disturbing force seems to have
acted under</p>

<p>a point, rather than along a line. The manner in which it has
acted, is probably explained by the structure of Little Stony-top,
a mountain 2,000 feet high, situated a few miles southward of the
Barn; we there see, even from a distance, a dark-coloured, sharp,
wedge of compact columnar rock, with the bright-coloured
feldspathic strata, sloping away on each side from its uncovered
apex. This wedge, from which it derives its name of Stony-top,
consists of a body of rock, which has been injected whilst
liquified into the overlying strata; and if we may suppose that a
similar body of rock lies injected, beneath the ridge connecting
the Barn and Flagstaff, the structure there exhibited would be
explained.</p>

<p><i>Turk's Cap and Prosperous Bays.</i>&mdash;Prosperous Hill is
a great, black, precipitous mountain, situated two miles and a half
south of the Barn, and composed, like it, of basaltic strata. These
rest, in one part, on the brown-coloured, porphyritic beds of the
basal series, and in another part, on a fissured mass of highly
scoriaceous and amygdaloidal rock, which seems to have formed a
small point of eruption beneath the sea, contemporaneously with the
basal series. Prosperous Hill, like the Barn, is traversed by many
dikes, of which the greater number range north and south, and its
strata dip, at an angle of about 20 degrees, rather obliquely from
the island towards the sea. The space between Prosperous Hill and
the Barn, as represented in figure No. 9, consists of lofty cliffs,
composed of the lavas of the upper or feldspathic series, which
rest, though unconformably, on the basal submarine strata, as we
have seen that they do at Flagstaff Hill. Differently, however,
from in that hill, these upper strata are nearly horizontal, gently
rising towards the interior of the island; and they are composed of
greenish-black, or more commonly, pale brown, compact lavas,
instead of softened and highly coloured matter. These
brown-coloured, compact lavas, consist almost entirely of small
glimmering scales, or of minute acicular crystals, of feldspar,
placed close by the side of each other, and abounding with minute
black specks, apparently of hornblende. The basaltic strata of
Prosperous Hill project only a little above the level of the
gently-sloping, feldspathic streams, which wind round and abut
against their upturned edges. The inclination of the basaltic
strata seems to be too great to have been caused by their having
flowed down a slope, and they must have been tilted into their
present position before the eruption of the feldspathic
streams.</p>

<p><i>Basaltic ring.</i>&mdash;Proceeding round the Island, the
lavas of the upper series, southward of Prosperous Hill, overhang
the sea in lofty precipices. Further on, the headland, called Great
Stony-top, is composed, as I</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 219">page 219</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>believe, of basalt; as is Long Range Point, on the inland side
of which the coloured beds abut. On the southern side of the
island, we see the basaltic strata of the South Barn, dipping
obliquely seaward at a considerable angle; this headland, also,
stands a little above the level of the more modern, feldspathic
lavas. Further on, a large space of coast, on each side of Sandy
Bay, has been much denuded, and there seems to be left only the
basal wreck of the great, central crater. The basaltic strata
reappear, with their seaward dip, at the foot of the hill, called
Man-and-Horse; and thence they are continued along the whole
north-western coast to Sugar-Loaf Hill, situated near to the
Flagstaff; and they everywhere have the same seaward inclination,
and rest, in some parts at least, on the lavas of the basal series.
We thus see that the circumference of the island is formed by a
much-broken ring, or rather, a horse-shoe, of basalt, open to the
south, and interrupted on the eastern side by many wide breaches.
The breadth of this marginal fringe on the north-western side,
where alone it is at all perfect, appears to vary from a mile to a
mile and a half. The basaltic strata, as well as those of the
subjacent basal series, dip, with a moderate inclination, where
they have not been subsequently disturbed, towards the sea. The
more broken state of the basaltic ring round the eastern half,
compared with the western half of the island, is evidently due to
the much greater denuding power of the waves on the eastern or
windward side, as is shown by the greater height of the cliffs on
that side, than to leeward. Whether the margin of basalt was
breached, before or after the eruption of the lavas of the upper
series, is doubtful; but as separate portions of the basaltic ring
appear to have been tilted before that event, and from other
reasons, it is more probable, that some at least of the breaches
were first formed. Reconstructing in imagination, as far as is
possible, the ring of basalt, the internal space or hollow, which
has since been filled up with the matter erupted from the great
central crater, appears to have been of an oval figure, eight or
nine miles in length by about four miles in breadth, and with its
axis directed in a N.E. and S.W. line, coincident with the present
longest axis of the island.</p>

<p><i>The central curved ridge.</i>&mdash;This ridge consists, as
before remarked, of grey feldspathic lavas, and of red, brecciated,
argillaceous tuffs, like the beds of the upper coloured series. The
grey lavas contain numerous, minute, black, easily fusible specks;
and but very few large crystals of feldspar. They are generally
much softened; with the exception of this character, and of being
in many parts highly cellular, they are quite similar to those
great sheets of lava which overhang the coast at Prosperous Bay.
Considerable intervals of time appear to have elapsed, judging from
the marks of denudation, between the formation of the successive
beds, of which this ridge is composed. On the steep northern slope,
I observed in several sections a much worn undulating surface of
red tuff, covered by grey, decomposed, feldspathic lavas, with only
a thin earthy layer interposed between them. In an adjoining part,
I noticed a trap-dike, four feet wide, cut off and covered up by
the feldspathic lava, as is represented in figure No. 9. The ridge
ends on the eastern side in a hook, which is not represented
clearly enough in any</p>

<p>map which I have seen; towards the western end, it gradually
slopes down and divides into several subordinate ridges. The best
defined portion between Diana's Peak and Nest Lodge, which supports
the highest pinnacles in the island varying from 2,000 to 2,700
feet, is rather less than three miles long in a straight line.
Throughout this space the ridge has a uniform appearance and
structure; its curvature resembles that of the coast-line of a
great bay, being made up of many smaller curves, all open to the
south. The northern and outer side is supported by narrow ridges or
buttresses, which slope down to the adjoining country. The inside
is much steeper, and is almost precipitous; it is formed of the
basset edges of the strata, which gently decline outwards. Along
some parts of the inner side, a little way beneath the summit, a
flat ledge extends, which imitates in outline the smaller
curvatures of the crest. Ledges of this kind occur not unfrequently
within volcanic craters, and their formation seems to be due to the
sinking down of a level sheet of hardened lava, the edges of which
remain (like the ice round a pool, from which the water has been
drained) adhering to the sides.<sup>1</sup></p>

<img src="images/no10.jpg" width="180" height="168" align="left"
alt="Dike"> 

<p>In some parts, the ridge is surmounted by a wall or parapet,
perpendicular on both sides. Near Diana's Peak this wall is
extremely narrow. At the Galapagos Archipelago I observed parapets,
having a quite similar structure and appearance, surmounting
several of the craters; one, which I more particularly examined,
was composed of glossy, red scori&aelig; firmly cemented together;
being externally perpendicular, and extending round nearly the
whole circumference of the crater, it rendered it almost
inaccessible. The Peak of Teneriffe and Cotopaxi, according to
Humboldt, are similarly constructed; he states<sup>2</sup> that "at
their summits a circular wall surrounds the crater, which wall, at
a distance, has the appearance of a small cylinder placed on a
truncated cone. On Cotopaxi<sup>3</sup> this peculiar structure is
visible to the naked eye at more than two thousand toises'
distance; and no person has ever reached its crater. On the Peak of
Teneriffe, the parapet is so high, that it would be impossible to
reach the caldera, if on the eastern side there did not exist a
breach." The origin of these circular parapets is probably due to
the heat or vapours from the crater, penetrating and hardening the
sides to a nearly equal depth, and afterwards to the mountain being
slowly acted on by the weather, which would leave the hardened
part, projecting in the form of a cylinder or circular parapet.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. A most remarkable instance of this structure is
described in Ellis "Polynesian Researches" (second edition), where
an admirable drawing is given of the successive ledges or terraces,
on the borders of the immense crater at Hawaii, in the Sandwich
Islands.<br>

<p>From the points of structure in the central ridge, now
enumerated,&mdash;namely, from the convergence towards it of the
beds of the upper series,&mdash;from the lavas there becoming
highly cellular,&mdash;from the flat ledge, extending along its
inner and precipitous side, like that within some still active
craters,&mdash;from the parapet-like wall on its summit,&mdash;and
lastly, from its peculiar curvature, unlike that of any common line
of elevation, I cannot doubt that this curved ridge forms the last
remnant of a great crater. In endeavouring, however, to trace its
former outline, one is soon baffled; its western extremity
gradually slopes down, and, branching into other ridges, extends to
the sea-coast; the eastern end is more curved, but it is only a
little better defined. Some appearances lead me to suppose that the
southern wall of the crater joined the present ridge near Nest
Lodge; in this case the crater must have been nearly three miles
long, and about a mile and a half in breadth. Had the denudation of
the ridge and the decomposition of its constituent rocks proceeded
a few steps further, and had this ridge, like several other parts
of the island, been broken up by great dikes and masses of injected
matter, we should in vain have endeavoured to discover its true
nature. Even now we have seen that at Flagstaff Hill the lower
extremity and most distant portion of one sheet of the erupted
matter has been upheaved to as great a height as the crater down
which it flowed, and probably even to a greater height. It is
interesting thus to trace the steps by which the structure of a
volcanic district becomes obscured, and finally obliterated: so
near to this last stage is St. Helena, that I believe no one has
hitherto suspected that the central ridge or axis of the island is
the last wreck of the crater, whence the most modern volcanic
streams were poured forth.</p>

<p>The great hollow space or valley southward of the central curved
ridge, across which the half of the crater must once have extended,
is formed of bare, water-worn hillocks and ridges of red, yellow,
and brown rocks, mingled together in chaos-like confusion,
interlaced by dikes, and without any regular stratification. The
chief part consists of red decomposing scori&aelig;, associated
with various kinds of tuff and yellow argillaceous beds, full of
broken crystals, those of augite being particularly large. Here and
there masses of highly cellular and amygdaloidal lavas protrude.
From one of the ridges in the midst of the valley, a conical
precipitous hill, called Lot, boldly stands up, and forms a most
singular and conspicuous object. It is composed of phonolite,
divided in one part into great curved lamin&aelig;, in another,
into angular concretionary balls, and in a third part into
outwardly radiating columns. At its base the strata of lava, tuff,
and scori&aelig;, dip away on all sides;<sup>1</sup> the uncovered
portion is 197 feet<sup>2</sup> in height, and its horizontal
section gives an oval figure. The phonolite is of a greenish-</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Abich in his "Views of Vesuvius" (plate vi),
has shown the manner in which beds, under nearly similar
circumstances, are tilted up. The upper beds are more turned up
than the lower; and he accounts for this, by showing that the lava
insinuates itself horizontally between the lower beds.<br>
2. This height is given by Mr. Seale in his Geognosy of the island.
The height of the summit above the level of the sea is said to be
1,444 feet.</p>

<p>grey colour, and is full of minute acicular crystals of
feldspar; in most parts it has a conchoidal fracture, and is
sonorous, yet it is crenulated with minute air-cavities. In a S.W.
direction from Lot, there are some other remarkable columnar
pinnacles, but of a less regular shape, namely, Lot's Wife, and the
Asses' Ears, composed of allied kinds of rock. From their flattened
shape, and their relative position to each other, they are
evidently connected on the same line of fissure. It is, moreover,
remarkable that this same N.E. and S.W. line, joining Lot and Lot's
Wife, if prolonged would intersect Flagstaff Hill, which, as before
stated, is crossed by numerous dikes running in this direction, and
which has a disturbed structure, rendering it probable that a great
body of once fluid rock lies injected beneath it.</p>

<p>In this same great valley there are several other conical masses
of injected rock (one, I observed, was composed of compact
greenstone), some of which are not connected, as far as is
apparent, with any line of dike; whilst others are obviously thus
connected. Of these dikes, three or four great lines stretch across
the valley in a N.E. and S.W. direction, parallel to that one
connecting the Asses' Ears, Lot's Wife, and probably Lot. The
number of these masses of injected rock is a remarkable feature in
the geology of St. Helena. Besides those just mentioned, and the
hypothetical one beneath Flagstaff Hill, there is Little Stony-top
and others, as I have reason to believe, at the Man-and-Horse, and
at High Hill. Most of these masses, if not all of them, have been
injected subsequently to the last volcanic eruptions from the
central crater. The formation of conical bosses of rock on lines of
fissure, the walls of which are in most cases parallel, may
probably be attributed to inequalities in the tension, causing
small transverse fissures, and at these points of intersection the
edges of the strata would naturally yield, and be easily turned
upwards. Finally, I may remark, that hills of phonolite everywhere
are apt<sup>1</sup> to assume singular and even grotesque shapes,
like that of Lot: the peak at Fernando Noronha offers an instance;
at St. Jago, however, the cones of phonolite, though tapering, have
a regular form. Supposing, as seems probable, that all such
hillocks or obelisks have originally been injected, whilst
liquified, into a mould formed by yielding strata, as certainly has
been the case with Lot, how are we to account for the frequent
abruptness and singularity of their outlines, compared with
similarly injected masses of greenstone and basalt? Can it be due
to a less perfect degree of fluidity, which is generally supposed
to be characteristic of the allied trachytic lavas?</p>

<p><i>Superficial deposits.</i>&mdash;Soft calcareous sandstone
occurs in extensive, though thin, superficial beds, both on the
northern and southern shores of the island. It consists of very
minute, equal-sized, rounded particles of shells, and other organic
bodies, which partially retain their yellow, brown, and pink
colours, and occasionally, though very rarely, present an obscure
trace of their original external forms. I in vain endeavoured to
find a single unrolled fragment of a shell. The colour of the
particles</p>

<p class="fnote">1. D'Aubuisson, in his "Trait&eacute; de
G&eacute;ognosie" (tome ii, p. 540) particularly remarks that this
is the case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 223">page 223</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>is the most obvious character by which their origin can be
recognised, the tints being affected (and an odour produced) by a
moderate heat, in the same manner as in fresh shells. The particles
are cemented together, and are mingled with some earthy matter: the
purest masses, according to Beatson, contain 70 per cent of
carbonate of lime. The beds, varying in thickness from two or three
feet to fifteen feet, coat the surface of the ground; they
generally lie on that side of the valley which is protected from
the wind, and they occur at the height of several hundred feet
above the level of the sea. Their position is the same which sand,
if now drifted by the trade-wind, would occupy; and no doubt they
thus originated, which explains the equal size and minuteness of
the particles, and likewise the entire absence of whole shells, or
even of moderately-sized fragments. It is remarkable that at the
present day there are no shelly beaches on any part of the coast,
whence calcareous dust could be drifted and winnowed; we must,
therefore, look back to a former period when before the land was
worn into the present great precipices, a shelving coast, like that
of Ascension, was favourable to the accumulation of shelly
detritus. Some of the beds of this limestone are between six
hundred and seven hundred feet above the sea; but part of this
height may possibly be due to an elevation of the land, subsequent
to the accumulation of the calcareous sand.</p>

<p>The percolation of rain-water has consolidated parts of these
beds into a solid rock, and has formed masses of dark brown,
stalagmitic limestone. At the Sugar-Loaf quarry, fragments of rock
on the adjoining slopes<sup>1</sup> have been thickly coated by
successive fine layers of calcareous matter. It is singular, that
many of these pebbles have their entire surfaces coated, without
any point of contact having been left uncovered; hence, these
pebbles must have been lifted up by the slow deposition between
them of the successive films of carbonate of lime. Masses of white,
finely oolitic rock are attached to the outside of some of these
coated pebbles. Von Buch has described a compact limestone at
Lanzarote, which seems perfectly to resemble the stalagmitic
deposition just mentioned: it coats pebbles, and in parts is finely
oolitic: it forms a far-extended layer, from one inch to two or
three feet in thickness, and it occurs at the height of 800 feet
above the sea, but only on that side of the island exposed to the
violent north-western winds. Von Buch remarks,<sup>2</sup> that it
is not found in hollows, but only on the unbroken and inclined
surfaces of the mountain. He believes, that it has been deposited
by the spray which is borne over the whole island by these violent
winds. It appears, however, to me much more probable that it has
been formed, as at St. Helena, by the percolation of water through
finely comminuted shells: for when sand is blown on</p>

<p class="fnote">1. In the earthy detritus on several parts of this
hill, irregular masses of very impure, crystallised sulphate of
lime occur. As this substance is now being abundantly deposited by
the surf at Ascension, it is possible that these masses may thus
have originated; but if so, it must have been at a period when the
land stood at a much lower level. This earthy selenite is now found
at a height of between six hundred and seven hundred feet.<br>

<p>a much-exposed coast, it always tends to accumulate on broad,
even surfaces, which offer a uniform resistance to the winds. At
the neighbouring island, moreover, of Feurteventura,<sup>1</sup>
there is an earthy limestone, which, according to Von Buch, is
quite similar to specimens which he has seen from St. Helena, and
which he believes to have been formed by the drifting of shelly
detritus.</p>

<p>The upper beds of the limestone, at the above-mentioned quarry
on the Sugar-Loaf Hill, are softer, finer-grained and less pure,
than the lower beds. They abound with fragments of land-shells, and
with some perfect ones; they contain, also, the bones of birds, and
the large eggs,<sup>2</sup> apparently of water-fowl. It is
probable that these upper beds remained long in an unconsolidated
form, during which time, these terrestrial productions were
embedded. Mr. G. R. Sowerby has kindly examined three species of
land-shells, which I procured from this bed, and has described them
in detail. One of them is a Succinea, identical with a species now
living abundantly on the island; the two others, namely, <i>
Cochlogena fossilis</i> and <i>Helix biplicata</i>, are not known
in a recent state: the latter species was also found in another and
different locality, associated with a species of Cochlogena which
is undoubtedly extinct.</p>

<p><i>Beds of extinct land-shells.</i>&mdash;Land-shells, all of
which appear to be species now extinct, occur embedded in earth, in
several parts of the island. The greater number have been found at
a considerable height on Flagstaff Hill. On the N.W. side of this
hill, a rain-channel exposes a section of about twenty feet in
thickness, of which the upper part consists of black vegetable
mould, evidently washed down from the heights above, and the lower
part of less black earth, abounding with young and old shells, and
with their fragments: part of this earth is slightly consolidated
by calcareous matter, apparently due to the partial decomposition
of some of the shells. Mr. Seale, an intelligent resident, who
first called attention to these shells, gave me a large collection
from another locality, where the shells appear to have been
embedded in very black earth. Mr. G. R. Sowerby has examined these
shells, and has described them. There are seven species, namely,
one Cochlogena, two species of the genus Cochlicopa, and four of
Helix; none of these are known in a recent state, or have been
found in any other country. The smaller species were picked out of
the inside of the large shells of the <i>Cochlogena
aurisvulpina.</i> This last-mentioned species is in many respects a
very singular one; it was classed, even by Lamarck, in a marine
genus, and having thus been mistaken for a sea-shell, and the
smaller accompanying species having been overlooked, the exact
localities where it was found have been measured, and the elevation
of this island thus deduced! It is very remarkable that all the
shells of this species found by me in one spot, form a distinct
variety, as described by Mr. Sowerby, from those</p>

<p class="fnote">1. <i>Idem,</i> pp. 314 and 374.<br>
2. Colonel Wilkes, in a catalogue presented with some specimens to
the Geological Society, states that as many as ten eggs were found
by one person. Dr. Buckland has remarked ("Geolog. Trans.," vol. v,
p. 474) on these eggs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 225">page 225</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>procured from another locality by Mr. Seale. As this Cochlogena
is a large and conspicuous shell, I particularly inquired from
several intelligent countrymen whether they had ever seen it alive;
they all assured me that they had not, and they would not even
believe that it was a land animal: Mr. Seale, moreover, who was a
collector of shells all his life at St. Helena, never met with it
alive. Possibly some of the smaller species may turn out to be yet
living kinds; but, on the other hand, the two land- shells which
are now living on the island in great numbers, do not occur
embedded, as far as is yet known, with the extinct species. I have
shown in my "Journal,"<sup>1</sup> that the extinction of these
land-shells possibly may not be an ancient event; as a great change
took place in the state of the island about one hundred and twenty
years ago, when the old trees died, and were not replaced by young
ones, these being destroyed by the goats and hogs, which had run
wild in numbers, from the year 1502. Mr. Seale states, that on
Flagstaff Hill, where we have seen that the embedded land-shells
are especially numerous, traces are everywhere discoverable, which
plainly indicate that it was once thickly clothed with trees; at
present not even a bush grows there. The thick bed of black
vegetable mould which covers the shell-bed, on the flanks of this
hill, was probably washed down from the upper part, as soon as the
trees perished, and the shelter afforded by them was lost.</p>

<p><i>Elevation of the land.</i>&mdash;Seeing that the lavas of the
basal series, which are of submarine origin, are raised above the
level of the sea, and at some places to the height of many hundred
feet, I looked out for superficial signs of the elevation of the
land. The bottoms of some of the gorges, which descend to the
coast, are filled up to the depth of about a hundred feet, by
rudely divided layers of sand, muddy clay, and fragmentary masses;
in these beds, Mr. Seale has found the bones of the tropic-bird and
of the albatross; the former now rarely, and the latter never
visiting the island. From the difference between these layers, and
the sloping piles of detritus which rest on them, I suspect that
they were deposited, when the gorges stood beneath the sea. Mr.
Seale, moreover, has shown that some of the fissure-like
gorges<sup>2</sup> become, with a concave outline, gradually rather
wider at the bottom than at the top; and this peculiar structure
was probably caused by the wearing action of the sea, when it
entered the lower part of these gorges. At greater heights, the
evidence of the rise of the land is even less clear: nevertheless,
in a bay-like depression on the table-land behind Prosperous Bay,
at the height of about a thousand feet, there are flat-topped
masses of rock, which it is scarcely conceivable, could have been
insulated from the surrounding and similar strata, by any other
agency than the denuding action of a sea- beach. Much denudation,
indeed, has been effected at great elevations, which it would not
be easy to explain by any other means: thus, the flat summit of the
Barn, which is 2,000 feet high, presents, according to Mr. Seale, a
perfect</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "Journal of Researches," p. 582.<br>

840 feet deep, and only 115 feet in width.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>network of truncated dikes; on hills like the Flagstaff, formed
of soft rock, we might suppose that the dikes had been worn down
and cut off by meteoric agency, but we can hardly suppose this
possible with the hard, basaltic strata of the Barn.</p>

<p><i>Coast denudation.</i>&mdash;The enormous cliffs, in many
parts between one and two thousand feet in height, with which this
prison-like island is surrounded, with the exception of only a few
places, where narrow valleys descend to the coast, is the most
striking feature in its scenery. We have seen that portions of the
basaltic ring, two or three miles in length by one or two miles in
breadth, and from one to two thousand feet in height, have been
wholly removed. There are, also, ledges and banks of rock, rising
out of profoundly deep water, and distant from the present coast
between three and four miles, which, according to Mr. Seale, can be
traced to the shore, and are found to be the continuations of
certain well-known great dikes. The swell of the Atlantic Ocean has
obviously been the active power in forming these cliffs; and it is
interesting to observe that the lesser, though still great, height
of the cliffs on the leeward and partially protected side of the
island (extending from the Sugar-Loaf Hill to South West Point),
corresponds with the lesser degree of exposure. When reflecting on
the comparatively low coasts of many volcanic islands, which also
stand exposed in the open ocean, and are apparently of considerable
antiquity, the mind recoils from an attempt to grasp the number of
centuries of exposure, necessary to have ground into mud and to
have dispersed the enormous cubic mass of hard rock which has been
pared off the circumference of this island. The contrast in the
superficial state of St. Helena, compared with the nearest island,
namely, Ascension, is very striking. At Ascension, the surfaces of
the lava-streams are glossy, as if just poured forth, their
boundaries are well defined, and they can often be traced to
perfect craters, whence they were erupted; in the course of many
long walks, I did not observe a single dike; and the coast round
nearly the entire circumference is low, and has been eaten back
(though too much stress must not be placed on this fact, as the
island may have been subsiding) into a little wall only from ten to
thirty feet high. Yet during the 340 years, since Ascension has
been known, not even the feeblest signs of volcanic action have
been recorded.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand, at St. Helena, the
course of no one stream of lava can be traced, either by the state
of its boundaries or of its superficies; the mere wreck of one
great crater is left; not the valleys only, but the surfaces of
some of the highest hills, are interlaced by worn-down dikes, and,
in many</p>

phenomena&mdash;earthquakes&mdash;troubled water&mdash;floating

intervals since the middle of the last century, in a space of open

island or an archipelago is in process of formation in the middle
of the Atlantic: a line joining St. Helena and Ascension,
prolonged, intersects this slowly nascent focus of volcanic
action.</p>

<br>
<center><i>Craters of Elevation.</i></center>

<p>There is much resemblance in structure and in geological history
between St. Helena, St. Jago, and Mauritius. All three islands are
bounded (at least in the parts which I was able to examine) by a
ring of basaltic mountains, now much broken, but evidently once
continuous. These mountains have, or apparently once had, their
escarpments steep towards the interior of the island, and their
strata dip outwards. I was able to ascertain, only in a few cases,
the inclination of the beds; nor was this easy, for the
stratification was generally obscure, except when viewed from a
distance. I feel, however, little doubt that, according to the
researches of M. Elie de Beaumont, their average inclination is
greater than that which they could have acquired, considering their
thickness and compactness, by flowing down a sloping surface. At
St. Helena, and at St. Jago, the basaltic strata rest on older and
probably submarine beds of different composition. At all three
islands, deluges of more recent lavas have flowed from the centre
of the island, towards and between the basaltic mountains; and at
St. Helena the central platform has been filled up by them. All
three islands have been raised in mass. At Mauritius the sea,
within a late geological period, must have reached to the foot of
the basaltic mountains, as it now does at St. Helena; and at St.
Jago it is cutting back the intermediate plain towards them. In
these three islands, but especially at St. Jago and at Mauritius,
when, standing on the summit of one of the old basaltic mountains,
one looks in vain towards the centre of the island,&mdash;the point
towards which the strata beneath one's feet, and of the mountains
on each side, rudely converge,&mdash;for a source whence these
strata could have been erupted; but one sees only a vast hollow
platform stretched beneath, or piles of matter of more recent
origin.</p>

<p>These basaltic mountains come, I presume, into the class of
Craters of elevation: it is immaterial whether the rings were ever
completely formed, for the portions which now exist have so uniform
a structure, that, if they do not form fragments of true craters,
they cannot be classed with ordinary lines of elevation. With
respect to their origin, after having read the works of Mr.
Lyell,<sup>1</sup> and of MM. C. Prevost and Virlet, I cannot
believe that the great central hollows have been formed by a simple
dome-shaped elevation, and the consequent arching of the strata. On
the other hand, I have very great difficulty in admitting that
these basaltic mountains are merely the basal fragments of great
volcanoes, of which the summits have either been blown off, or more
probably swallowed up by subsidence. These rings are, in some
instances, so immense, as at St. Jago and at Mauritius, and their
occurrence is so frequent, that I can hardly persuade myself to
adopt</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>this explanation. Moreover, I suspect that the following
circumstances, from their frequent concurrence, are someway
connected together,&mdash;a connection not implied in either of the
above views: namely, first, the broken state of the ring; showing
that the now detached portions have been exposed to great
denudation, and in some cases, perhaps, rendering it probable that
the ring never was entire; secondly, the great amount of matter
erupted from the central area after or during the formation of the
ring; and thirdly, the elevation of the district in mass. As far as
relates to the inclination of the strata being greater than that
which the basal fragments of ordinary volcanoes would naturally
possess, I can readily believe that this inclination might have
been slowly acquired by that amount of elevation, of which,
according to M. Elie de Beaumont, the numerous upfilled fissures or
dikes are the evidence and the measure,&mdash;a view equally novel
and important, which we owe to the researches of that geologist on
Mount Etna.</p>

<p>A conjecture, including the above circumstances, occurred to me,
when,&mdash; with my mind fully convinced, from the phenomena of
1835 in South America,<sup>1</sup> that the forces which eject
matter from volcanic orifices and raise continents in mass are
identical,&mdash;I viewed that part of the coast of St. Jago, where
the horizontally upraised, calcareous stratum dips into the sea,
directly beneath a cone of subsequently erupted lava. The
conjecture is that, during the slow elevation of a volcanic
district or island, in the centre of which one or more orifices
continue open, and thus relieve the subterranean forces, the
borders are elevated more than the central area; and that the
portions thus upraised do not slope gently into the central, less
elevated area, as does the calcareous stratum under the cone at St.
Jago, and as does a large part of the circumference of
Iceland,<sup>2</sup> but that they are separated from it by curved
faults.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I have given a detailed account of these
phenomena, in a paper read before the Geological Society in March
1838. At the instant of time, when an immense area was convulsed
and a large tract elevated, the districts immediately surrounding
several of the great vents in the Cordillera remained quiescent;
the subterranean forces being apparently relieved by the eruptions,
which then recommenced with great violence. An event of somewhat
the same kind, but on an infinitely smaller scale, appears to have
taken place, according to Abich ("Views of Vesuvius," plates i and
ix), within the great crater of Vesuvius, where a platform on one
side of a fissure was raised in mass twenty feet, whilst on the
other side, a train of small volcanoes burst forth in eruption.<br>
 2. It appears, from information communicated to me in the most
obliging manner by M. E. Robert, that the circumferential parts of
Iceland, which are composed of ancient basaltic strata alternating
with tuff, dip inland, thus forming a gigantic saucer. M. Robert
found that this was the case, with a few and quite local
exceptions, for a space of coast several hundred miles in length. I
find this statement corroborated, as far as regards one place, by
Mackenzie in his "Travels" (p. 377), and in another place by some
MS. notes kindly lent me by Dr. Holland. The coast is deeply
indented by creeks, at the head of which the land is generally low.
M. Robert informs me, that the inwardly dipping strata appear to
extend as far as this line, and that their inclination usually
corresponds with the slope of the surface, from the high
coast-mountains to the low land at the head of these creeks. In the
section described by Sir G. Mackenzie, the dip is 120. The interior
parts of the island chiefly consist, as far as is known, of
recently erupted matter. The great size, however, of Iceland,
equalling the bulkiest part of England, ought perhaps to exclude it
from the class of islands we have been considering; but I cannot
avoid suspecting that if the coast-mountains, instead of gently
sloping into the less elevated central area, had been separated
from it by irregularly curved faults, the strata would have been
tilted seaward, and a "Crater of elevation," like that of St. Jago
or that of Mauritius, but of much vaster dimensions, would have
been formed. I will only further remark, that the frequent
occurrence of extensive lakes at the foot of large volcanoes, and
the frequent association of volcanic and fresh-water strata, seem
to indicate that the areas around volcanoes are apt to be depressed
beneath the level of the adjoining country, either from having been
less elevated, or from the effects of subsidence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 229">page 229</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We might expect, from what we see along ordinary faults, that
the strata on the upraised side, already dipping outwards from
their original formation as lava-streams, would be tilted from the
line of fault, and thus have their inclination increased. According
to this hypothesis, which I am tempted to extend only to some few
cases, it is not probable that the ring would ever be formed quite
perfect; and from the elevation being slow, the upraised portions
would generally be exposed to much denudation, and hence the ring
become broken; we might also expect to find occasional inequalities
in the dip of the upraised masses, as is the case at St. Jago. By
this hypothesis the elevation of the districts in mass, and the
flowing of deluges of lava from the central platforms, are likewise
connected together. On this view the marginal basaltic mountains of
the three foregoing islands might still be considered as forming
"Craters of elevation;" the kind of elevation implied having been
slow, and the central hollow or platform having been formed, not by
the arching of the surface, but simply by that part having been
upraised to a less height.</p>

<p>America. It consists of five principal islands, and of several
small ones, which together are equal in area,<sup>1</sup> but not
in extent of land, to Sicily, conjointly with the Ionian Islands.
They are all volcanic: on two, craters have been seen in eruption,
and on several of the other islands, streams of lava have a recent
appearance. The larger islands are chiefly composed of solid rock,
and they rise with a tame outline to a height of between one and
four thousand feet. They are sometimes, but not generally,
surmounted by one principal orifice. The craters vary in size from
mere spiracles to huge caldrons several miles in circumference;
they are extraordinarily numerous, so that I should think, if
enumerated, they would be found to exceed two thousand; they are
formed either of scori&aelig; and lava, or of a brown-coloured
tuff; and these latter craters are in several respects remarkable.
The whole group was surveyed by the officers of the <i>Beagle.</i>
I visited myself four of the principal islands, and received
specimens from all the others. Under the head of the different
islands I will describe only that which appears to me deserving of
attention.</p>

volcanic islands of Culpepper and Wenman, lying seventy miles
northward of the group. Craters were visible on all the islands of
the group, except on Towers Island, which is one of the lowest;
this island is, however, formed of volcanic rocks.</p>

<p>C<small>HATHAM</small> I<small>SLAND.</small> <i>Craters
composed of a singular kind of tuff.</i>&mdash;Towards the eastern
end of this island there occur two craters composed of two kinds of
tuff; one kind being friable, like slightly consolidated ashes; and
the other compact, and of a different nature from anything which I
have met with described. This latter substance, where it is best
characterised, is of a yellowish-brown colour, translucent, and
with a lustre somewhat resembling resin; it is brittle, with an
angular, rough, and very irregular fracture, sometimes, however,
being slightly granular, and even obscurely crystalline: it can
readily be scratched with a knife, yet some points are hard enough
just to mark common glass; it fuses with ease into a blackish-green
glass. The mass contains numerous broken crystals of olivine and
augite, and small particles of black and brown scori&aelig;; it is
often traversed by thin seams of calcareous matter. It generally
affects a nodular or concretionary structure. In a hand specimen,
this substance would certainly be mistaken for a pale and peculiar
variety of pitchstone; but when seen in mass its stratification,
and the numerous layers of fragments of basalt, both angular and
rounded, at once render its subaqueous origin evident. An
examination of a series of specimens shows that this resin-like
substance results from a chemical change on small particles of pale
and dark-coloured scoriaceous rocks; and this change could be
distinctly traced in different stages round the edges of even the
same particle. The position near the coast of all the craters
composed of this kind of tuff or peperino, and their breached
condition, renders it probable that they were all formed when
standing immersed in the sea; considering this circumstance,
together with the remarkable absence of large beds of ashes in the
whole archipelago, I think it highly probable that much the greater
part of the tuff has originated from the trituration of fragments
of the grey, basaltic lavas in the mouths of craters standing in
the sea. It may be asked whether the heated water within these
craters has produced this singular change in the small scoriaceous
particles and given to them their translucent, resin-like fracture.
Or has the associated lime played any part in this change? I ask
these questions from having found at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde
Islands, that where a great stream of molten lava has flowed over a
calcareous bottom into the sea, the outermost film, which in other
parts resembles pitchstone, is changed, apparently by its contact
with the carbonate of lime, into a resin-like substance, precisely
like the best characterised specimens of the tuff from this
archipelago.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>To return to the two craters: one of them stands at the distance
of a league from the coast, the intervening tract consisting of a
calcareous tuff, apparently of submarine origin. This crater
consists of a circle of hills some of which stand quite detached,
but all have a very regular,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The concretions containing lime, which I have
described at Ascension, as formed in a bed of ashes, present some
degree of resemblance to this substance, but they have not a
resinous fracture. At St. Helena, also, I found veins of a somewhat
similar, compact, but non-resinous substance, occurring in a bed of
pumiceous ashes, apparently free from calcareous matter: in neither
of these cases could heat have acted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>qu&acirc;-qu&acirc; versal dip, at an inclination of between
thirty and forty degrees. The lower beds, to the thickness of
several hundred feet, consist of the resin-like stone, with
embedded fragments of lava. The upper beds, which are between
thirty and forty feet in thickness, are composed of a thinly
stratified, fine-grained, harsh, friable, brown-coloured tuff, or
peperino.<sup>1</sup> A central mass without any stratification,
which must formerly have occupied the hollow of the crater, but is
now attached only to a few of the circumferential hills, consists
of a tuff, intermediate in character between that with a
resin-like, and that with an earthy fracture. This mass contains
white calcareous matter in small patches. The second crater (520
feet in height) must have existed until the eruption of a recent,
great stream of lava, as a separate islet; a fine section, worn by
the sea, shows a grand funnel-shaped mass of basalt, surrounded by
steep, sloping flanks of tuff, having in parts an earthy, and in
others a semi-resinous fracture. The tuff is traversed by several
broad, vertical dikes, with smooth and parallel sides, which I did
not doubt were formed of basalt, until I actually broke off
fragments. These dikes, however, consist of tuff like that of the
surrounding strata, but more compact, and with a smoother fracture;
hence we must conclude, that fissures were formed and filled up
with the finer mud or tuff from the crater, before its interior was
occupied, as it now is, by a solidified pool of basalt. Other
fissures have been subsequently formed, parallel to these singular
dikes, and are merely filled with loose rubbish. The change from
ordinary scoriaceous particles to the substance with a
semi-resinous fracture, could be clearly followed in portions of
the compact tuff of these dikes.</p>

<p class="capt">The Kicker Rock, 400 feet high.</p>

<p>At the distance of a few miles from these two craters, stands
the Kicker Rock, or islet, remarkable from its singular form. It is
unstratified, and is composed of compact tuff, in parts having the
resin-like fracture. It is probable that this amorphous mass, like
that similar mass in the case first described, once filled up the
central hollow of a crater, and that its flanks, or sloping walls,
have since been worn quite away by the sea, in which it stands
exposed.</p>

<p><i>Small basaltic craters.</i>&mdash;A bare, undulating tract,
at the eastern end of Chatham Island, is remarkable from the
number, proximity, and form of the small basaltic craters with
which it is studded. They consist, either</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Those geologists who restrict the term of
"tuff" to ashes of a white colour, resulting from the attrition of
feldspathic lavas, would call these brown-coloured strata
"peperino."</p>

<p>of a mere conical pile, or, but less commonly, of a circle, of
black and red, glossy scori&aelig;, partially cemented together.
They vary in diameter from thirty to one hundred and fifty yards,
and rise from about fifty to one hundred feet above the level of
the surrounding plain. From one small eminence, I counted sixty of
these craters, all of which were within a third of a mile from each
other, and many were much closer. I measured the distance between
two very small craters, and found that it was only thirty yards
from the summit-rim of one to the rim of the other. Small streams
of black, basaltic lava, containing olivine and much glassy
feldspar, have flowed from many, but not from all of these craters.
The surfaces of the more recent streams were exceedingly rugged,
and were crossed by great fissures; the older streams were only a
little less rugged; and they were all blended and mingled together
in complete confusion. The different growth, however, of the trees
on the streams, often plainly marked their different ages. Had it
not been for this latter character, the streams could in few cases
have been distinguished; and, consequently, this wide undulatory
tract might have (as probably many tracts have) been erroneously
considered as formed by one great deluge of lava, instead of by a
multitude of small streams, erupted from many small orifices.</p>

<p>In several parts of this tract, and especially at the base of
the small craters, there are circular pits, with perpendicular
sides, from twenty to forty feet deep. At the foot of one small
crater, there were three of these pits. They have probably been
formed, by the falling in of the roofs of small
caverns.<sup>1</sup> In other parts, there are mammiform hillocks,
which resemble great bubbles of lava, with their summits fissured
by irregular cracks, which appeared, upon entering them, to be very
deep; lava has not flowed from these hillocks. There are, also,
other very regular, mammiform hillocks, composed of stratified
lava, and surmounted by circular, steep-sided hollows, which, I
suppose have been formed by a body of gas, first, arching the
strata into one of the bubble-like hillocks, and then, blowing off
its summit. These several kinds of hillocks and pits, as well as
the numerous, small, scoriaceous craters, all show that this tract
has been penetrated, almost like a sieve, by the passage of heated
vapours. The more regular hillocks could only have been heaved up,
whilst the lava was in a softened state.<sup>2</sup></p>

2. Sir G. Mackenzie ("Travels in Iceland," pp. 389 to 392) has
described a plain of lava at the foot of Hecla, everywhere heaved
up into great bubbles or blisters. Sir George states that this
cavernous lava composes the uppermost stratum; and the same fact is
affirmed by Von Buch ("Descript. des Isles Canaries," p. 159), with
respect to the basaltic stream near Rialejo, in Teneriffe. It
appears singular that it should be the upper streams that are
chiefly cavernous, for one sees no reason why the upper and lower
should not have been equally affected at different
times;&mdash;have the inferior streams flowed beneath the pressure
of the sea, and thus been flattened, after the passage through
them, of bodies of gas?</p>

<p>A<small>LBEMARLE</small> I<small>SLAND</small>.&mdash;This
island consists of five, great, flat-topped craters, which,
together with the one on the adjoining island of Narborough,
singularly resemble each other, in form and height. The southern
one is 4,700 feet high, two others are 3,720 feet, a third only 50
feet higher, and the remaining ones apparently of nearly the same
height. Three of these are situated on one line, and their craters
appear elongated in nearly the same direction. The northern crater,
which is not the largest, was found by the triangulation to
measure, externally, no less than three miles and one-eighth of a
mile in diameter. Over the lips of these great, broad caldrons, and
from little orifices near their summits, deluges of black lava have
flowed down their naked sides.</p>

<p><i>Fluidity of different lavas.</i>&mdash;Near Tagus or Banks'
Cove, I examined one of these great streams of lava, which is
remarkable from the evidence of its former high degree of fluidity,
especially when its composition is considered. Near the sea-coast
this stream is several miles in width. It consists of a black,
compact base, easily fusible into a black bead, with angular and
not very numerous air-cells, and thickly studded with large,
fractured crystals of glassy albite,<sup>1</sup> varying from the
tenth of an inch to half an inch in diameter. This lava, although
at first sight appearing eminently porphyritic, cannot properly be
considered so, for the crystals have evidently been enveloped,
rounded, and penetrated by the lava, like fragments of foreign rock
in a trap-dike. This was very clear in some specimens of a similar
lava, from Abingdon Island, in which the only difference was, that
the vesicles were spherical and more numerous. The albite in these
lavas is in a similar condition with the leucite of Vesuvius, and
with the olivine, described by Von Buch,<sup>2</sup> as projecting
in great balls from the basalt of Lanzarote. Besides the albite,
this lava contains scattered grains of a green mineral, with no
distinct cleavage, and closely resembling olivine;<sup>3</sup> but
as it fuses easily into a green glass, it belongs probably to the
augitic family: at James Island, however, a similar lava contained
true olivine. I obtained specimens from the actual</p>

<p class="fnote">1. In the Cordillera of Chile, I have seen lava
very closely resembling this variety at the Galapagos Archipelago.
It contained, however, besides the albite, well-formed crystals of
augite, and the base (perhaps in consequence of the aggregation of
the augitic particles) was a shade lighter in colour. I may here
remark, that in all these cases, I call the feldspathic crystals,
<i>albite</i>, from their cleavage-planes (as measured by the
reflecting goniometer) corresponding with those of that mineral.
As, however, other species of this genus have lately been
discovered to cleave in nearly the same planes with albite, this
determination must be considered as only provisional. I examined
the crystals in the lavas of many different parts of the Galapagos
group, and I found that none of them, with the exception of some
crystals from one part of James Island, cleaved in the direction of
orthite or potash-feldspar.<br>

occurring in the volcanic rocks of the Cordillera of Quito, for
olivine.</p>

<p>surface, and from a depth of four feet, but they differed in no
respect. The high degree of fluidity of this lava-stream was at
once evident, from its smooth and gently sloping surface, from the
manner in which the main stream was divided by small inequalities
into little rills, and especially from the manner in which its
edges, far below its source, and where it must have been in some
degree cooled, thinned out to almost nothing; the actual margin
consisting of loose fragments, few of which were larger than a
man's head. The contrast between this margin, and the steep walls,
above twenty feet high, bounding many of the basaltic streams at
Ascension, is very remarkable. It has generally been supposed that
lavas abounding with large crystals, and including angular
vesicles,<sup>1</sup> have possessed little fluidity; but we see
that the case has been very different at Albemarle Island. The
degree of fluidity in different lavas, does not seem to correspond
with any <i>apparent</i> corresponding amount of difference in
their composition: at Chatham Island, some streams, containing much
glassy albite and some olivine, are so rugged, that they may be
compared to a sea frozen during a storm; whilst the great stream at
Albemarle Island is almost as smooth as a lake when ruffled by a
breeze. At James Island, black basaltic lava, abounding with small
grains of olivine, presents an intermediate degree of roughness;
its surface being glossy, and the detached fragments resembling, in
a very singular manner, folds of drapery, cables, and pieces of the
bark of trees.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><i>Craters of tuff.</i>&mdash;About a mile southward of Banks'
Cove, there is a fine elliptic crater, about five hundred feet in
depth, and three-quarters of a mile in diameter. Its bottom is
occupied by a lake of brine, out of which some little crateriform
hills of tuff rise. The lower beds are formed of compact tuff,
appearing like a subaqueous deposit; whilst the upper beds, round
the entire circumference, consist of a harsh, friable tuff, of
little specific gravity, but often containing fragments of rock in
layers. This upper tuff contains numerous pisolitic balls, about
the size of small bullets, which differ from the surrounding
matter, only in being slightly</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The irregular and angular form of the vesicles
is probably caused by the unequal yielding of a mass composed, in
almost equal proportion, of solid crystals and of a viscid base. It
certainly seems a general circumstance, as might have been
expected, that in lava, which has possessed a high degree of
fluidity, <i>as well as an even-sized grain</i>, the vesicles are
internally smooth and spherical.<br>
2. A specimen of basaltic lava, with a few small broken crystals of
albite, given me by one of the officers, is perhaps worthy of
description. It consists of cylindrical ramifications, some of
which are only the twentieth of an inch in diameter, and are drawn
out into the sharpest points. The mass has not been formed like a
stalactite, for the points terminate both upwards and downwards.
Globules, only the fortieth of an inch in diameter, have dropped
from some of the points, and adhere to the adjoining branches. The
lava is vesicular, but the vesicles never reach the surface of the
branches, which are smooth and glossy. As it is generally supposed
that vesicles are always elongated in the direction of the movement
of the fluid mass, I may observe, that in these cylindrical
branches, which vary from a quarter to only the twentieth of an
inch in diameter, every air-cell is spherical.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 236">page 236</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>harder and finer grained. The beds dip away very regularly on
all sides, at angles varying, as I found by measurement, from
twenty-five to thirty degrees. The external surface of the crater
slopes at a nearly similar inclination, and is formed by slightly
convex ribs, like those on the shell of a pecten or scallop, which
become broader as they extend from the mouth of the crater to its
base. These ribs are generally from eight to twenty feet in
breadth, but sometimes they are as much as forty feet broad; and
they resemble old, plastered, much flattened vaults, with the
plaster scaling off in plates: they are separated from each other
by gullies, deepened by alluvial action. At their upper and narrow
ends, near the mouth of the crater, these ribs often consist of
real hollow passages, like, but rather smaller than, those often
formed by the cooling of the crust of a lava-stream, whilst the
inner parts have flowed onward;&mdash;of which structure I saw many
examples at Chatham Island. There can be no doubt but that these
hollow ribs or vaults have been formed in a similar manner, namely,
by the setting or hardening of a superficial crust on streams of
mud, which have flowed down from the upper part of the crater. In
another part of this same crater, I saw open concave gutters
between one and two feet wide, which appear to have been formed by
the hardening of the lower surface of a mud stream, instead of, as
in the former case, of the upper surface. From these facts I think
it is certain that the tuff must have flowed as mud.<sup>1</sup>
This mud may have been formed either within the crater, or from
ashes deposited on its upper parts, and afterwards washed down by
torrents of rain. The former method, in most of the cases, appears
the more probable one; at James Island, however, some beds of the
friable kind of tuff extend so continuously over an uneven surface,
that probably they were formed by the falling of showers of
ashes.</p>

<p>Within this same crater, strata of coarse tuff, chiefly composed
of fragments of lava, abut, like a consolidated talus, against the
inside walls. They rise to a height of between one hundred and one
hundred and fifty feet above the surface of the internal
brine-lake; they dip inwards, and are inclined at an angle varying
from thirty to thirty-six degrees. They appear to have been formed
beneath water, probably at a period when the sea occupied the
hollow of the crater. I was surprised to observe that beds having
this great inclination did not, as far as they could be followed,
thicken towards their lower extremities.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. This conclusion is of some interest, because M.
Dufrenoy ("M&eacute;m. pour servir," tome iv, p. 274) has argued
from strata of tuff, apparently of similar composition with that
here described, being inclined at angles between 18&deg; and
20&deg;, that Monte Nuevo and some other craters of Southern Italy
have been formed by upheaval. From the facts given above, of the
vaulted character of the separate rills, and from the tuff not
extending in horizontal sheets round these crateriform hills, no
one will suppose that the strata have here been produced by
elevation; and yet we see that their inclination is above 20&deg;,
and often as much as 30&deg;. The consolidated strata also, of the
internal talus, as will be immediately seen, dips at an angle of
above 30&deg;.</p>

<p>compact, and includes numerous fragments of lava; it appears
like a subaqueous deposit. The most remarkable feature in this
crater is the great development of strata converging inwards, as in
the last case, at a considerable inclination, and often deposited
in irregular curved layers. These interior converging beds, as well
as the proper, diverging crateriform strata, are represented in
figure No. 13, a rude, sectional sketch of the headlands, forming
this Cove. The internal and external strata differ little in
composition, and the former have evidently resulted from the wear
and tear, and redeposition of the matter forming the external
crateriform strata. From the great development of these inner beds,
a person walking round the rim of this crater might fancy himself
on a circular anticlinal ridge of stratified sandstone and
conglomerate. The sea is wearing away the inner and outer strata,
and especially the latter; so that the inwardly converging strata
will, perhaps, in some future age, be left standing alone&mdash;a
case which might at first perplex a geologist.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>J<small>AMES</small> I<small>SLAND</small>.&mdash;Two craters of
tuff on this island are the only remaining ones which require any
notice. One of them lies a mile and a half inland from Puerto
Grande: it is circular, about the third of a mile in diameter, and
400 feet in depth. It differs from all the other tuff-craters which
I examined, in having the lower part of its cavity, to the height
of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet, formed by a
precipitous wall of basalt, giving to the crater the appearance of
having burst through a solid sheet of rock. The upper part of this
crater consists of strata of the altered tuff, with a semi-resinous
fracture. Its bottom is</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I believe that this case actually occurs in the
Azores, where Dr. Webster ("Description," p. 185) has described a
basin-formed, little island, composed of <i>strata of tuff</i>,
dipping inwards and bounded externally by steep sea-worn cliffs.
Dr. Daubeny supposes (on Volcanoes, p. 266), that this cavity must
have been formed by a circular subsidence. It appears to me far
more probable, that we here have strata which were originally
deposited within the hollow of a crater, of which the exterior
walls have since been removed by the sea.</p>

<p>occupied by a shallow lake of brine, covering layers of salt,
which rest on deep black mud. The other crater lies at the distance
of a few miles, and is only remarkable from its size and perfect
condition. Its summit is 1,200 feet above the level of the sea, and
the interior hollow is 600 feet deep. Its external sloping surface
presented a curious appearance from the smoothness of the wide
layers of tuff, which resembled a vast plastered floor. Brattle
Island is, I believe, the largest crater in the Archipelago
composed of tuff; its interior diameter is nearly a nautical mile.
At present it is in a ruined condition, consisting of little more
than half a circle open to the south; its great size is probably
due, in part, to internal degradation, from the action of the
sea.</p>

<p class="capt">Segment of a very small orifice of eruption, on the
beach of Fresh-water Bay.</p>

<p><i>Segment of a basaltic crater.</i>&mdash;One side of
Fresh-water Bay, in James Island, is bounded by a promontory, which
forms the last wreck of a great crater. On the beach of this
promontory, a quadrant-shaped segment of a small subordinate point
of eruption stands exposed. It consists of nine separate little
streams of lava piled upon each other; and of an irregular
pinnacle, about fifteen feet high, of reddish-brown, vesicular
basalt, abounding with large crystals of glassy albite, and with
fused augite. This pinnacle, and some adjoining paps of rock on the
beach, represent the axis of the crater. The streams of lava can be
followed up a little ravine, at right angles to the coast, for
between ten and fifteen yards, where they are hidden by detritus:
along the beach they are visible for nearly eighty yards, and I do
not believe that they extend much further. The three lower streams
are united to the pinnacle; and at the point of junction (as shown
in figure No. 14, a rude sketch made on the spot), they are
slightly arched, as if in the act of flowing over the lip of the
crater. The six upper streams no doubt were originally united to
this same column before it was worn down by the sea. The lava of
these streams is of similar composition with that of the pinnacle,
excepting that the crystals of albite appear to be more comminuted,
and the grains of fused augite are absent. Each stream is separated
from the one above it by a few inches, or at most by one or two
feet in thickness, of loose fragmentary scori&aelig;,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 239">page 239</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>apparently derived from the abrasion of the streams in passing
over each other. All these streams are very remarkable from their
thinness. I carefully measured several of them; one was eight
inches thick, but was firmly coated with three inches above, and
three inches below, of red scoriaceous rock (which is the case with
all the streams), making altogether a thickness of fourteen inches:
this thickness was preserved quite uniformly along the entire
length of the section. A second stream was only eight inches thick,
including both the upper and lower scoriaceous surfaces. Until
examining this section, I had not thought it possible that lava
could have flowed in such uniformly thin sheets over a surface far
from smooth. These little streams closely resemble in composition
that great deluge of lava at Albemarle Island, which likewise must
have possessed a high degree of fluidity.</p>

<p><i>Pseudo-extraneous, ejected fragments.</i>&mdash;In the lava
and in the scori&aelig; of this little crater, I found several
fragments, which, from their angular form, their granular
structure, their freedom from air-cells, their brittle and burnt
condition, closely resembled those fragments of primary rocks which
are occasionally ejected, as at Ascension, from volcanoes. These
fragments consist of glassy albite, much mackled, and with very
imperfect cleavages, mingled with semi-rounded grains, having
tarnished, glossy surfaces, of a steel-blue mineral. The crystals
of albite are coated by a red oxide of iron, appearing like a
residual substance; and their cleavage-planes also are sometimes
separated by excessively fine layers of this oxide, giving to the
crystals the appearance of being ruled like a glass micrometer.
There was no quartz. The steel-blue mineral, which is abundant in
the pinnacle, but which disappears in the streams derived from the
pinnacle, has a fused appearance, and rarely presents even a trace
of cleavage; I obtained, however, one measurement, which proved
that it was augite; and in one other fragment, which differed from
the others, in being slightly cellular, and in gradually blending
into the surrounding matrix the small grains of this mineral were
tolerably well crystallised. Although there is so wide a difference
in appearance between the lava of the little streams, and
especially of their red scoriaceous crusts, and one of these
angular ejected fragments, which at first sight might readily be
mistaken for syenite, yet I believe that the lava has originated
from the melting and movement of a mass of rock of absolutely
similar composition with the fragments. Besides the specimen above
alluded to, in which we see a fragment becoming slightly cellular,
and blending into the surrounding matrix, some of the grains of the
steel-blue augite also have their surfaces becoming very finely
vesicular, and passing into the nature of the surrounding paste;
other grains are throughout, in an intermediate condition. The
paste seems to consist of the augite more perfectly fused, or, more
probably, merely disturbed in its softened state by the movement of
the mass, and mingled with the oxide of iron and with finely
comminuted, glassy albite. Hence probably it is that the fused
albite, which is abundant in the pinnacle, disappears in the
streams. The albite is in exactly the same state, with the
exception of most of the crystals being smaller in the lava and in
the embedded fragments; but</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 240">page 240</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>in the fragments they appear to be less abundant: this, however,
would naturally happen from the intumescence of the augitic base,
and its consequent apparent increase in bulk. It is interesting
thus to trace the steps by which a compact granular rock becomes
converted into a vesicular, pseudo-porphyritic lava, and finally
into red scori&aelig;. The structure and composition of the
embedded fragments show that they are parts either of a mass of
primary rock which has undergone considerable change from volcanic
action, or more probably of the crust of a body of cooled and
crystallised lava, which has afterwards been broken up and
re-liquified; the crust being less acted on by the renewed heat and
movement.</p>

<p><i>Concluding remarks on the tuff-craters.</i>&mdash;These
craters, from the peculiarity of the resin-like substance which
enters largely into their composition, from their structure, their
size and number, present the most striking feature in the geology
of this Archipelago. The majority of them form either separate
islets, or promontories attached to the larger islands; and those
which now stand at some little distance from the coast are worn and
breached, as if by the action of the sea. From this general
circumstance of their position, and from the small quantity of
ejected ashes in any part of the Archipelago, I am led to conclude,
that the tuff has been chiefly produced, by the grinding together
of fragments of lava within active craters, communicating with the
sea. In the origin and composition of the tuff, and in the frequent
presence of a central lake of brine and of layers of salt, these
craters resemble, though on a gigantic scale, the "salses," or
hillocks of mud, which are common in some parts of Italy and in
other countries.<sup>1</sup> Their closer connection, however, in
this Archipelago, with ordinary volcanic action, is shown by the
pools of solidified basalt, with which they are sometimes filled
up.</p>

<p>It at first appears very singular, that all the craters formed
of tuff have their southern sides, either quite broken down and
wholly removed, or much lower than the other sides. I saw and
received accounts of twenty-eight of these craters; of these,
twelve form separate islets,<sup>2</sup> and now exist as mere
crescents quite open to the south, with occasionally a few points
of rock marking their former circumference: of the remaining
sixteen, some form promontories, and others stand at a little
distance inland from the shore; but all have their southern sides
either the lowest, or quite broken down. Two, however, of the
sixteen had</p>

<p class="fnote">1. D'Aubuisson's "Trait&eacute; de
G&eacute;ognosie," tome i, p. 189. I may remark, that I saw at
Terceira, in the Azores, a crater of tuff or peperino, very similar
to these of the Galapagos Archipelago. From the description given
in Freycinet "Voyage," similar ones occur at the Sandwich Islands;
and probably they are present in many other places.<br>
2. These consist of the three Crossman Islets, the largest of which
is 600 feet in height; Enchanted Island; Gardner Island (760 feet
high); Champion Island (331 feet high); Enderby Island; Brattle
Island; two islets near Indefatigable Island; and one near James
Island. A second crater near James Island (with a salt lake in its
centre) has its southern side only about twenty feet high, whilst
the other parts of the circumference are about three hundred feet
in height.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 241">page 241</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>their northern sides also low, whilst their eastern and western
sides were perfect. I did not see, or hear of, a single exception
to the rule, of these craters being broken down or low on the side,
which faces a point of the horizon between S.E. and S.W. This rule
does not apply to craters composed of lava and scori&aelig;. The
explanation is simple: at this Archipelago, the waves from the
trade-wind, and the swell propagated from the distant parts of the
open ocean, coincide in direction (which is not the case in many
parts of the Pacific), and with their united forces attack the
southern sides of all the islands; and consequently the southern
slope, even when entirely formed of hard basaltic rock, is
invariably steeper than the northern slope. As the tuff-craters are
composed of a soft material, and as probably all, or nearly all,
have at some period stood immersed in the sea, we need not wonder
that they should invariably exhibit on their exposed sides the
effects of this great denuding power. Judging from the worn
condition of many of these craters, it is probable that some have
been entirely washed away. As there is no reason to suppose, that
the craters formed of scori&aelig; and lava were erupted whilst
standing in the sea, we can see why the rule does not apply to
them. At Ascension, it was shown that the mouths of the craters,
which are there all of terrestrial origin, have been affected by
the trade-wind; and this same power might here, also, aid in making
the windward and exposed sides of some of the craters originally
the lowest.</p>

<p><i>Mineralogical composition of the rocks.</i>&mdash;In the
northern islands, the basaltic lavas seem generally to contain more
albite than they do in the southern half of the Archipelago; but
almost all the streams contain some. The albite is not unfrequently
associated with olivine. I did not observe in any specimen
distinguishable crystals of hornblende or augite; I except the
fused grains in the ejected fragments, and in the pinnacle of the
little crater, above described. I did not meet with a single
specimen of true trachyte; though some of the paler lavas, when
abounding with large crystals of the harsh and glassy albite,
resemble in some degree this rock; but in every case the basis
fuses into a black enamel. Beds of ashes and far-ejected
scori&aelig;, as previously stated, are almost absent; nor did I
see a fragment of obsidian or of pumice. Von Buch<sup>1</sup>
believes that the absence of pumice on Mount Etna is consequent on
the feldspar being of the Labrador variety; if the presence of
pumice depends on the constitution of the feldspar, it is
remarkable, that it should be absent in this archipelago, and
abundant in the Cordillera of South America, in both of which
regions the feldspar is of the albitic variety. Owing to the
absence of ashes, and the general indecomposable character of the
lava in this Archipelago, the islands are slowly clothed with a
poor vegetation, and the scenery has a desolate and frightful
aspect.</p>

<p><i>Elevation of the land.</i>&mdash;Proofs of the rising of the
land are scanty and imperfect. At Chatham Island, I noticed some
great blocks of lava, cemented by calcareous matter, containing
recent shells; but they occurred at the height of only a few feet
above high-water mark. One</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "Description des Isles Canaries," p. 328.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 242">page 242</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>of the officers gave me some fragments of shells, which he found
embedded several hundred feet above the sea, in the tuff of two
craters, distant from each other. It is possible, that these
fragments may have been carried up to their present height in an
eruption of mud; but as, in one instance, they were associated with
broken oyster- shells, almost forming a layer, it is more probable
that the tuff was uplifted with the shells in mass. The specimens
are so imperfect that they can be recognised only as belonging to
recent marine genera. On Charles Island, I observed a line of great
rounded blocks, piled on the summit of a vertical cliff, at the
height of fifteen feet above the line, where the sea now acts
during the heaviest gales. This appeared, at first, good evidence
in favour of the elevation of the land; but it was quite deceptive,
for I afterwards saw on an adjoining part of this same coast, and
heard from eye-witnesses, that wherever a recent stream of lava
forms a smooth inclined plane, entering the sea, the waves during
gales have the power of <i>rolling up rounded</i> blocks to a great
height, above the line of their ordinary action. As the little
cliff in the foregoing case is formed by a stream of lava, which,
before being worn back, must have entered the sea with a gently
sloping surface, it is possible or rather it is probable, that the
rounded boulders, now lying on its summit, are merely the remnants
of those which had been <i>rolled up</i> during storms to their
present height.</p>

<p><i>Direction of the fissures of eruption.</i>&mdash;The volcanic
orifices in this group cannot be considered as indiscriminately
scattered. Three great craters on Albermarle Island form a
well-marked line, extending N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. Narborough
Island, and the great crater on the rectangular projection of
Albemarle Island, form a second parallel line. To the east, Hood's
Island, and the islands and rocks between it and James Island, form
another nearly parallel line, which, when prolonged, includes
Culpepper and Wenman Islands, lying seventy miles to the north. The
other islands lying further eastward, form a less regular fourth
line. Several of these islands, and the vents on Albemarle Island,
are so placed, that they likewise fall on a set of rudely parallel
lines, intersecting the former lines at right angles; so that the
principal craters appear to lie on the points where two sets of
fissures cross each other. The islands themselves, with the
exception of Albemarle Island, are not elongated in the same
direction with the lines on which they stand. The direction of
these islands is nearly the same with that which prevails in so
remarkable a manner in the numerous archipelagoes of the great
Pacific Ocean. Finally, I may remark, that amongst the Galapagos
Islands there is no one dominant vent much higher than all the
others, as may be observed in many volcanic archipelagoes: the
highest is the great mound on the south-western extremity of
Albemarle Island, which exceeds by barely a thousand feet several
other neighbouring craters.</p>

<p><i>On the separation of the constituent minerals of lava,
according to their specific gravities.</i>&mdash;One side of
Fresh-water Bay, in James Island, is formed by the wreck of a large
crater, mentioned in the last chapter, of which the interior has
been filled up by a pool of basalt, about two hundred feet in
thickness. This basalt is of a grey colour, and contains many
crystals of glassy albite, which become much more numerous in the
lower, scoriaceous part. This is contrary to what might have been
expected, for if the crystals had been originally disseminated in
equal numbers, the greater intumescence of this lower scoriaceous
part would have made them appear fewer in number. Von
Buch<sup>1</sup> has described a stream of obsidian on the Peak of
Teneriffe, in which the crystals of feldspar become more and more
numerous, as the depth or thickness increases, so that near the
lower surface of the stream the lava even resembles a primary rock.
Von Buch further states, that M. Dree, in his experiments in
melting lava, found that the crystals of feldspar always tended to
precipitate themselves to the bottom of the crucible. In these
cases, I presume there can be no doubt<sup>2</sup> that the
crystals sink from their weight. The specific gravity of feldspar
varies from 2&middot;4 to 2&middot;58, whilst obsidian seems
commonly to be from 2&middot;3 to 2&middot;4; and in a fluidified
state its specific gravity would probably be less, which would</p>

<p class="fnote">1. "Description des Isles Canaries," pp. 190 and
191.<br>
2. In a mass of molten iron, it is found (<i>Edinburgh New
Philosophical Journal</i>, vol. xxiv, p. 66) that the substances,
which have a closer affinity for oxygen than iron has, rise from
the interior of the mass to the surface. But a similar cause can
hardly apply to the separation of the crystals of these
lava-streams. The cooling of the surface of lava seems, in some
cases, to have affected its composition; for Dufrenoy ("M&eacute;m.
pour servir," tome iv, p. 271) found that the interior parts of a
stream near Naples contained two-thirds of a mineral which was
acted on by acids, whilst the surface consisted chiefly of a
mineral unattackable by acids.<br>
3. I have taken the specific gravities of the simple minerals from
Von Kobell, one of the latest and best authorities, and of the
rocks from various authorities. Obsidian, according to Phillips, is
2&middot;35; and Jameson says it never exceeds 2&middot;4; but a
specimen from Ascension, weighed by myself, was 2&middot;42.</p>

<p>facilitate the sinking of the crystals of feldspar. At James
Island, the crystals of albite, though no doubt of less weight than
the grey basalt, in the parts where compact, might easily be of
greater specific gravity than the scoriaceous mass, formed of
melted lava and bubbles of heated gas.</p>

<p>The sinking of crystals through a viscid substance like molten
rock, as is unequivocally shown to have been the case in the
experiments of M. Dr&eacute;e, is worthy of further consideration,
as throwing light on the separation of the trachytic and basaltic
series of lavas. Mr. P. Scrope has speculated on this subject; but
he does not seem to have been aware of any positive facts, such as
those above given; and he has overlooked one very necessary
element, as it appears to me, in the phenomenon&mdash;namely, the
existence of either the lighter or heavier mineral in globules or
in crystals. In a substance of imperfect fluidity, like molten
rock, it is hardly credible, that the separate, infinitely small
atoms, whether of feldspar, augite, or of any other mineral, would
have power from their slightly different gravities to overcome the
friction caused by their movement; but if the atoms of any one of
these minerals became, whilst the others remained fluid, united
into crystals or granules, it is easy to perceive that from the
lessened friction, their sinking or floating power would be greatly
increased. On the other hand, if all the minerals became granulated
at the same time, it is scarcely possible, from their mutual
resistance, that any separation could take place. A valuable,
practical discovery, illustrating the effect of the granulation of
one element in a fluid mass, in aiding its separation, has lately
been made: when lead containing a small proportion of silver, is
constantly stirred whilst cooling, it becomes granulated, and the
grains of imperfect crystals of nearly pure lead sink to the
bottom, leaving a residue of melted metal much richer in silver;
whereas if the mixture be left undisturbed, although kept fluid for
a length of time, the two metals show no signs of
separating.<sup>1</sup> The sole use of the stirring seems to be,
the formation of detached granules. The specific gravity of silver
is 10&middot;4, and of lead 11&middot;35: the granulated lead,
which sinks, is never absolutely pure, and the residual fluid metal
contains, when richest, only 1/119 part of silver. As the
difference in specific gravity, caused by the different proportions
of the two metals, is so exceedingly small, the separation is
probably aided in a great degree by the difference in gravity
between the lead, when granular though still hot, and when
fluid.</p>

<p>In a body of liquified volcanic rock, left for some time without
any violent disturbance, we might expect, in accordance with the
above facts, that if one of the constituent minerals became
aggregated into</p>

<p class="fnote">1. A full and interesting account of this
discovery, by Mr. Pattinson, was read before the British
Association in September 1838. In some alloys, according to Turner
("Chemistry," p. 210), the heaviest metal sinks, and it appears
that this takes place whilst both metals are fluid. Where there is
a considerable difference in gravity, as between iron and the slag
formed during the fusion of the ore, we need not be surprised at
the atoms separating, without either substance being
granulated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>crystals or granules, or had been enveloped in this state from
some previously existing mass, such crystals or granules would rise
or sink, according to their specific gravity. Now we have plain
evidence of crystals being embedded in many lavas, whilst the paste
or basis has continued fluid. I need only refer, as instances, to
the several, great, pseudo-porphyritic streams at the Galapagos
Islands, and to the trachytic streams in many parts of the world,
in which we find crystals of feldspar bent and broken by the
movement of the surrounding, semi-fluid matter. Lavas are chiefly
composed of three varieties of feldspar, varying in specific
gravity from 2&middot;4 to 2&middot;74; of hornblende and augite,
varying from 3&middot;0 to 3&middot;4; of olivine, varying from
3&middot;3 to 3&middot;4; and lastly, of oxides of iron, with
specific gravities from 4&middot;8 to 5&middot;2. Hence crystals of
feldspar, enveloped in a mass of liquified, but not highly
vesicular lava, would tend to rise to the upper parts; and crystals
or granules of the other minerals, thus enveloped, would tend to
sink. We ought not, however, to expect any perfect degree of
separation in such viscid materials. Trachyte, which consists
chiefly of feldspar, with some hornblende and oxide of iron, has a
specific gravity of about 2&middot;45;<sup>1</sup> whilst basalt,
composed chiefly of augite and feldspar, often with much iron and
olivine, has a gravity of about 3&middot;0. Accordingly we find,
that where both trachytic and basaltic streams have proceeded from
the same orifice, the trachytic streams have generally been first
erupted owing, as we must suppose, to the molten lava of this
series having accumulated in the upper parts of the volcanic focus.
This order of eruption has been observed by Beudant, Scrope, and by
other authors; three instances, also, have been given in this
volume. As the later eruptions, however, from most volcanic
mountains, burst through their basal parts, owing to the increased
height and weight of the internal column of molten rock, we see
why, in most cases, only the lower flanks of the central, trachytic
masses, are enveloped by basaltic streams. The separation of the
ingredients of a mass of lava, would, perhaps, sometimes take place
within the body of a volcanic mountain, if lofty and of great
dimensions, instead of within the underground focus; in which case,
trachytic streams might be poured forth, almost contemporaneously,
or at short recurrent intervals, from its summit, and basaltic
streams from its base: this seems to have taken place at
Teneriffe.<sup>2</sup> I need only further remark, that from
violent disturbances the separation of the two series, even under
otherwise favourable conditions, would naturally often be
prevented, and likewise their usual order of eruption be inverted.
From the high degree of fluidity of most basaltic lavas, these
perhaps, alone, would in many cases reach the surface.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Trachyte from Java was found by Von Buch to be
2&middot;47; from Auvergne, by De la Beche, it was 2&middot;42;
from Ascension, by myself, it was 2&middot;42. Jameson and other
authors give to basalt a specific gravity of 3&middot;0; but
specimens from Auvergne were found, by De la Beche, to be only
2&middot;78; and from the Giant's Causeway, to be 2&middot;91.<br>

Physique" of this island, which might serve as a model of
descriptive geology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we have seen that crystals of feldspar, in the instance
described by Von Buch, sink in obsidian, in accordance with their
known greater specific gravity, we might expect to find in every
trachytic district, where obsidian has flowed as lava, that it had
proceeded from the upper or highest orifices. This, according to
Von Buch, holds good in a remarkable manner both at the Lipari
Islands and on the Peak of Teneriffe; at this latter place obsidian
has never flowed from a less height than 9,200 feet. Obsidian,
also, appears to have been erupted from the loftiest peaks of the
Peruvian Cordillera. I will only further observe, that the specific
gravity of quartz varies from 2&middot;6 to 2&middot;8; and
therefore, that when present in a volcanic focus, it would not tend
to sink with the basaltic bases; and this, perhaps, explains the
frequent presence, and the abundance of this mineral, in the lavas
of the trachytic series, as observed in previous parts of this
volume.</p>

<p>An objection to the foregoing theory will, perhaps, be drawn
from the plutonic rocks not being separated into two evidently
distinct series, of different specific gravities; although, like
the volcanic, they have been liquified. In answer, it may first be
remarked, that we have no evidence of the atoms of any one of the
constituent minerals in the plutonic series having been aggregated,
whilst the others remained fluid, which we have endeavoured to show
is an almost necessary condition of their separation; on the
contrary, the crystals have generally impressed each other with
their forms.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>In the second place, the perfect tranquillity, under which it is
probable that the plutonic masses, buried at profound depths, have
cooled, would, most likely, be highly unfavourable to the
separation of their constituent minerals; for, if the attractive
force, which during the progressive cooling draws together the
molecules of the different minerals, has power sufficient to keep
them together, the friction between such half-formed crystals or
pasty globules would effectually prevent the heavier ones from
sinking, or the lighter ones from rising. On the other hand, a
small amount of disturbance, which would probably occur in most
volcanic foci, and which we have seen does not prevent the
separation of granules of lead from a mixture of molten lead and
silver, or crystals of feldspar from streams of lava, by
breaking</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The crystalline paste of phonolite is
frequently penetrated by long needles of hornblende; from which it
appears that the hornblende, though the more fusible mineral, has
crystallised before, or at the same time with a more refractory
substance. Phonolite, as far as my observations serve, in every
instance appears to be an injected rock, like those of the plutonic
series; hence probably, like these latter, it has generally been
cooled without repeated and violent disturbances. Those geologists
who have doubted whether granite could have been formed by igneous
liquefaction, because minerals of different degrees of fusibility
impress each other with their forms, could not have been aware of
the fact of crystallised hornblende penetrating phonolite, a rock
undoubtedly of igneous origin. The viscidity, which it is now
known, that both feldspar and quartz retain at a temperature much
below their points of fusion, easily explains their mutual
impressment. Consult on this subject Mr. Horner's paper on Bonn,
"Geolog. Transact.," vol. iv, p. 439; and "L'Institut," with
respect to quartz, 1839, p. 161.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 247">page 247</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and dissolving the less perfectly formed globules, would permit
the more perfect and therefore unbroken crystals, to sink or rise,
according to their specific gravity.</p>

<p>Although in plutonic rocks two distinct species, corresponding
to the trachytic and basaltic series, do not exist, I much suspect
that a certain amount of separation of their constituent parts has
often taken place. I suspect this from having observed how
frequently dikes of greenstone and basalt intersect widely extended
formations of granite and the allied metamorphic rocks. I have
never examined a district in an extensive granitic region without
discovering dikes; I may instance the numerous trap-dikes, in
several districts of Brazil, Chile, and Australia, and at the Cape
of Good Hope: many dikes likewise occur in the great granitic
tracts of India, in the north of Europe, and in other countries.
Whence, then, has the greenstone and basalt, forming these dikes,
come? Are we to suppose, like some of the elder geologists, that a
zone of trap is uniformly spread out beneath the granitic series,
which composes, as far as we know, the foundations of the earth's
crust? Is it not more probable, that these dikes have been formed
by fissures penetrating into partially cooled rocks of the granitic
and metamorphic series, and by their more fluid parts, consisting
chiefly of hornblende, oozing out, and being sucked into such
fissures? At Bahia, in Brazil, in a district composed of gneiss and
primitive greenstone, I saw many dikes, of a dark augitic (for one
crystal certainly was of this mineral) or hornblendic rock, which,
as several appearances clearly proved, either had been formed
before the surrounding mass had become solid, or had together with
it been afterwards thoroughly softened.<sup>1</sup> On both sides
of one of these dikes, the gneiss was penetrated, to the distance
of several yards, by numerous, curvilinear threads or streaks of
dark matter, which resembled in form clouds of the class called
cirrhi-com&aelig;; some few of these threads could be traced to
their junction with the dike. When examining them, I doubted
whether such hair-like and curvilinear veins could have been
injected, and I now suspect, that instead of having been injected
from the dike, they were its feeders. If the foregoing views of the
origin of trap-dikes in widely extended granitic regions far from
rocks of any other formation, be admitted as probable, we may
further admit, in the case of a great body of plutonic rock, being
impelled by repeated movements into the axis of a mountain-chain,
that its more liquid constituent parts might drain into deep and
unseen abysses; afterwards, perhaps, to be brought to the surface
under the form, either of injected masses of greenstone and augitic
porphyry,<sup>2</sup> or of basaltic eruptions. Much of</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Portions of these dikes have been broken off,
and are now surrounded by the primary rocks, with their
lamin&aelig; conformably winding round them. Dr. Hubbard also
(<i>Silliman's Journal,</i> vol. xxxiv, p. 119), has described an
interlacement of trap-veins in the granite of the White Mountains,
which he thinks must have been formed when both rocks were
soft.<br>
2. Mr. Phillips ("Lardner's Encyclop.," vol. ii, p. 115) quotes Von
Buch's statement, that augitic porphyry ranges parallel to, and is
found constantly at the base of, great chains of mountains.
Humboldt, also, has remarked the frequent occurrence of trap-rock,
in a similar position; of which fact I have observed many examples
at the foot of the Chilian Cordillera. The existence of granite in
the axes of great mountain chains is always probable, and I am
tempted to suppose, that the laterally injected masses of augitic
porphyry and of trap, bear nearly the same relation to the granitic
axes which basaltic lavas bear to the central trachytic masses,
round the flanks of which they have so frequently been erupted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the difficulty which geologists have experienced when they have
compared the composition of volcanic with plutonic formations,
will, I think, be removed, if we may believe that most plutonic
masses have been, to a certain extent, drained of those
comparatively weighty and easily liquified elements, which compose
the trappean and basaltic series of rocks.</p>

<p><i>On the distribution of volcanic islands.</i>&mdash;During my
investigations on coral-reefs, I had occasion to consult the works
of many voyagers, and I was invariably struck with the fact, that
with rare exceptions, the innumerable islands scattered throughout
the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, were composed either of
volcanic, or of modern coral-rocks. It would be tedious to give a
long catalogue of all the volcanic islands; but the exceptions
which I have found are easily enumerated: in the Atlantic, we have
St. Paul's Rock, described in this volume, and the Falkland
Islands, composed of quartz and clay-slate; but these latter
islands are of considerable size, and lie not very far from the
South American coast:<sup>1</sup> in the Indian Ocean, the
Seychelles (situated in a line prolonged from Madagascar) consist
of granite and quartz: in the Pacific Ocean, New Caledonia, an
island of large size, belongs (as far as is known) to the primary
class. New Zealand, which contains much volcanic rock and some
active volcanoes, from its size cannot be classed with the small
islands, which we are now considering. The presence of a small
quantity of non-volcanic rock, as of clay-slate on three of the
Azores,<sup>2</sup> or of tertiary limestone at Madeira, or of
clay-slate at Chatham Island in the Pacific, or of lignite at
Kerguelen Land, ought not to exclude such islands or archipelagoes,
if formed chiefly of erupted matter, from the volcanic class.</p>

<p>The composition of the numerous islands scattered through the
great oceans being with such rare exceptions volcanic, is evidently
an extension of that law, and the effect of those same causes,
whether chemical or mechanical, from which it results, that a vast
majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either as islands in
the sea, or near its shores. This fact of the ocean-islands being
so generally volcanic is also interesting in relation to the nature
of the mountain-chains on our</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Judging from Forster's imperfect observation,
perhaps Georgia is not volcanic. Dr. Allan is my informant with
regard to the Seychelles. I do not know of what formation
Rodriguez, in the Indian Ocean, is composed.<br>
2. This is stated on the authority of Count V. de Bedemar, with
respect to Flores and Graciosa (Charlsworth, "Magazine of Nat.
Hist.," vol. i, p. 557). St. Maria has no volcanic rock, according
to Captain Boyd (Von Buch "Descript.," p. 365). Chatham Island has
been described by Dr. Dieffenbach in the "Geographical Journal,"
1841, p. 201. As yet we have received only imperfect notices on
Kerguelen Land, from the Antarctic Expedition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>continents, which are comparatively seldom volcanic; and yet we
are led to suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean
once extended. Do volcanic eruptions, we may ask, reach the surface
more readily through fissures formed during the first stages of the
conversion of the bed of the ocean into a tract of land?</p>

<p>Looking at the charts of the numerous volcanic archipelagoes, we
see that the islands are generally arranged either in single,
double, or triple rows, in lines which are frequently curved in a
slight degree.<sup>1</sup> Each separate island is either rounded,
or more generally elongated in the same direction with the group in
which it stands, but sometimes transversely to it. Some of the
groups which are not much elongated present little symmetry in
their forms; M. Virlet<sup>2</sup> states that this is the case
with the Grecian Archipelago: in such groups I suspect (for I am
aware how easy it is to deceive oneself on these points), that the
vents are generally arranged on one line, or on a set of short
parallel lines, intersecting at nearly right angles another line,
or set of lines. The Galapagos Archipelago offers an example of
this structure, for most of the islands and the chief orifices on
the largest island are so grouped as to fall on a set of lines
ranging about N.W. by N., and on another set ranging about W.S.W.:
in the Canary Archipelago we have a simpler structure of the same
kind: in the Cape de Verde group, which appears to be the least
symmetrical of any oceanic volcanic archipelago, a N.W. and S.E.
line formed by several islands, if prolonged, would intersect at
right angles a curved line, on which the remaining islands are
placed. Von Buch<sup>3</sup> has classed all volcanoes under two
heads, namely, <i>central volcanoes</i>, round which numerous
eruptions have taken place on all sides, in a manner almost
regular, and <i>volcanic chains.</i> In the examples given of the
first class, as far as position is concerned, I can see no grounds
for their being called "central;" and the evidence of any
difference in mineralogical nature between <i>central volcanoes</i>
and <i>volcanic chains</i> appears slight. No doubt some one island
in most small volcanic archipelagoes is apt to be considerably
higher than the others; and in a similar manner, whatever the cause
may be, that on the same island one vent is generally higher than
all the others. Von Buch does not include in his class of volcanic
chains small archipelagoes, in which the islands are admitted by
him, as at the Azores, to be arranged in lines; but when viewing on
a map of the world how perfect a series exists from a few volcanic
islands placed in a row to a train of linear archipelagoes
following each other in a straight line, and so on to a great wall
like the Cordillera of America, it is difficult to believe that
there exists any essential difference between short and long
volcanic chains. Von Buch<sup>4</sup> states that his volcanic
chains surmount,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Professors William and Henry Darwin Rogers have
lately insisted much, in a memoir read before the American
Association, on the regularly curved lines of elevation in parts of
the Appalachian range.<br>

<p>or are closely connected with, mountain-ranges of primary
formation: but if trains of linear archipelagoes are, in the course
of time, by the long-continued action of the elevatory and volcanic
forces, converted into mountain-ranges, it would naturally result
that the inferior primary rocks would often be uplifted and brought
into view.</p>

<p>Some authors have remarked that volcanic islands occur
scattered, though at very unequal distances, along the shores of
the great continents, as if in some measure connected with them. In
the case of Juan Fernandez, situated 330 miles from the coast of
Chile, there was undoubtedly a connection between the volcanic
forces acting under this island and under the continent, as was
shown during the earthquake of 1835. The islands, moreover, of some
of the small volcanic groups which thus border continents, are
placed in lines, related to those along which the adjoining shores
of the continents trend; I may instance the lines of intersection
at the Galapagos, and at the Cape de Verde Archipelagoes, and the
best marked line of the Canary Islands. If these facts be not
merely accidental, we see that many scattered volcanic islands and
small groups are related not only by proximity, but in the
direction of the fissures of eruption to the neighbouring
continents&mdash;a relation, which Von Buch considers,
characteristic of his great volcanic chains.</p>

<p>In volcanic archipelagoes, the orifices are seldom in activity
on more than one island at a time; and the greater eruptions
usually recur only after long intervals. Observing the number of
craters, that are usually found on each island of a group, and the
vast amount of matter which has been erupted from them, one is led
to attribute a high antiquity even to those groups, which appear,
like the Galapagos, to be of comparatively recent origin. This
conclusion accords with the prodigious amount of degradation, by
the slow action of the sea, which their originally sloping coasts
must have suffered, when they are worn back, as is so often the
case, into grand precipices. We ought not, however, to suppose, in
hardly any instance, that the whole body of matter, forming a
volcanic island, has been erupted at the level, on which it now
stands: the number of dikes, which seem invariably to intersect the
interior parts of every volcano, show, on the principles explained
by M. Elie de Beaumont, that the whole mass has been uplifted and
fissured. A connection, moreover, between volcanic eruptions and
contemporaneous elevations in mass<sup>1</sup> has, I think, been
shown to exist in my work on Coral-Reefs, both from the frequent
presence of upraised organic remains, and from the structure of the
accompanying coral-reefs. Finally, I may remark, that in the same
Archipelago, eruptions have taken place within the historical
period on more than one of the parallel lines of fissure: thus, at
the Galapagos Archipelago, eruptions have taken place from a vent
on Narborough Island, and from one on Albemarle Island, which vents
do not fall on the same line; at the Canary Islands, eruptions have
taken place in Teneriffe and Lanzarote; and at</p>

<p class="fnote">1. A similar conclusion is forced on us, by the
phenomena, which accompanied the earthquake of 1835, at Concepcion,
and which are detailed in my paper (vol. v, p. 601) in the
"Geological Transactions."</p>

<p>the Azores, on the three parallel lines of Pico, St. Jorge, and
Terceira. Believing that a mountain-axis differs essentially from a
volcano, only in plutonic rocks having been injected, instead of
volcanic matter having been ejected, this appears to me an
interesting circumstance; for we may infer from it as probable,
that in the elevation of a mountain-chain, two or more of the
parallel lines forming it may be upraised and injected within the
same geological period.</p>

<p>The <i>Beagle</i>, in her homeward voyage, touched at New
Zealand, Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and the Cape of Good Hope.
In order to confine the Third Part of these Geological Observations
to South America, I will here briefly describe all that I observed
at these places worthy of the attention of geologists.</p>

<p><i>New South Wales.</i>&mdash;My opportunities of observation
consisted of a ride of ninety geographical miles to Bathurst, in a
W.N.W. direction from Sydney. The first thirty miles from the coast
passes over a sandstone country, broken up in many places by
trap-rocks, and separated by a bold escarpment overhanging the
river Nepean, from the great sandstone platform of the Blue
Mountains. This upper platform is 1,000 feet high at the edge of
the escarpment, and rises in a distance of twenty-five miles to
between three and four thousand feet above the level of the sea. At
this distance the road descends to a country rather less elevated,
and composed in chief part of primary rocks. There is much granite,
in one part passing into a red porphyry with octagonal crystals of
quartz, and intersected in some places by trap-dikes. Near the
Downs of Bathurst I passed over much pale-brown, glossy clay-slate,
with the shattered lamin&aelig; running north and south; I mention
this fact, because Captain King informs me that, in the country a
hundred miles southward, near Lake George, the mica-slate ranges so
invariably north and south that the inhabitants take advantage of
it in finding their way through the forests.</p>

<p>The sandstone of the Blue Mountains is at least 1,200 feet
thick, and in some parts is apparently of greater thickness; it
consists of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 252">page 252</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>small grains of quartz, cemented by white earthy matter, and it
abounds with ferruginous veins. The lower beds sometimes alternate
with shales and coal: at Wolgan I found in carbonaceous shale
leaves of the <i>Glossopteris Brownii</i>, a fern which so
frequently accompanies the coal of Australia. The sandstone
contains pebbles of quartz; and these generally increase in number
and size (seldom, however, exceeding an inch or two in diameter) in
the upper beds: I observed a similar circumstance in the grand
sandstone formation at the Cape of Good Hope. On the South American
coast, where tertiary and supra-tertiary beds have been extensively
elevated, I repeatedly noticed that the uppermost beds were formed
of coarser materials than the lower: this appears to indicate that,
as the sea became shallower, the force of the waves or currents
increased. On the lower platform, however, between the Blue
Mountains and the coast, I observed that the upper beds of the
sandstone frequently passed into argillaceous shale,&mdash;the
effect, probably, of this lower space having been protected from
strong currents during its elevation. The sandstone of the Blue
Mountains evidently having been of mechanical origin, and not
having suffered any metamorphic action, I was surprised at
observing that, in some specimens, nearly all the grains of quartz
were so perfectly crystallised with brilliant facets that they
evidently had not in their <i>present</i> form been aggregated in
any previously existing rock.<sup>1</sup> It is difficult to
imagine how these crystals could have been formed; one can hardly
believe that they were separately precipitated in their present
crystallised state. Is it possible that rounded grains of quartz
may have been acted on by a fluid corroding their surfaces, and
depositing on them fresh silica? I may remark that, in the
sandstone formation of the Cape of Good Hope, it is evident that
silica has been profusely deposited from aqueous solution.</p>

<p>In several parts of the sandstone I noticed patches of shale
which might at the first glance have been mistaken for extraneous
fragments; their horizontal lamin&aelig;, however, being parallel
with those of the sandstone, showed that they were the remnants of
thin, continuous beds. One such fragment (probably the section of a
long narrow strip) seen in the face of a cliff, was of greater
vertical thickness than breadth, which proves that this bed of
shale must have been in some slight degree consolidated, after
having been deposited, and before being worn away by the currents.
Each patch of the shale shows, also, how slowly many of the
successive layers of sandstone were deposited. These
pseudo-fragments of shale will perhaps explain, in some cases, the
origin of apparently extraneous fragments in crystalline
metamorphic rocks. I mention this, because I found near Rio de
Janeiro a well-defined angular fragment, seven yards long by two
yards in breadth, of gneiss</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I have lately seen, in a paper by Smith (the
father of English geologists), in the <i>Magazine of Natural
History</i>, that the grains of quartz in the millstone grit of
England are often crystallised. Sir David Brewster, in a paper read
before the British Association, 1840, states, that in old
decomposed glass, the silex and metals separate into concentric
rings, and that the silex regains its crystalline structure, as is
shown by its action on light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>containing garnets and mica in layers, enclosed in the ordinary,
stratified, porphyritic gneiss of the country. The lamin&aelig; of
the fragment and of the surrounding matrix ran in exactly the same
direction, but they dipped at different angles. I do not wish to
affirm that this singular fragment (a solitary case, as far as I
know) was originally deposited in a layer, like the shale in the
Blue Mountains, between the strata of the porphyritic gneiss,
before they were metamorphosed; but there is sufficient analogy
between the two cases to render such an explanation possible.</p>

<p><i>Stratification of the escarpment.</i>&mdash;The strata of the
Blue Mountains appear to the eye horizontal; but they probably have
a similar inclination with the surface of the platform, which
slopes from the west towards the escarpment over the Nepean, at an
angle of one degree, or of one hundred feet in a mile.<sup>1</sup>
The strata of the escarpment dip almost conformably with its
steeply inclined face, and with so much regularity, that they
appear as if thrown into their present position; but on a more
careful examination, they are seen to thicken and to thin out, and
in the upper part to be succeeded and almost capped by horizontal
beds. These appearances render it probable, that we here see an
original escarpment, not formed by the sea having eaten back into
the strata, but by the strata having originally extended only thus
far. Those who have been in the habit of examining accurate charts
of sea-coasts, where sediment is accumulating, will be aware, that
the surfaces of the banks thus formed, generally slope from the
coast very gently towards a certain line in the offing, beyond
which the depth in most cases suddenly becomes great. I may
instance the great banks of sediment within the West Indian
Archipelago,<sup>2</sup> which terminate in submarine slopes,
inclined at angles of between thirty and forty degrees, and
sometimes even at more than forty degrees: every one knows how
steep such a slope would appear on the land. Banks of this nature,
if uplifted, would probably have nearly the same external form as
the platform of the Blue Mountains, where it abruptly terminates
over the Nepean.</p>

<p><i>Current-cleavage.</i>&mdash;The strata of sandstone in the
low coast country, and likewise on the Blue Mountains, are often
divided by cross or current lamin&aelig;, which dip in different
directions, and frequently at an angle of forty-five degrees. Most
authors have attributed these cross layers to successive small
accumulations on an inclined surface; but from a careful
examination in some parts of the New Red Sandstone of England, I
believe that such layers generally form parts of a series of</p>

<p class="fnote">1. This is stated on the authority of Sir T.
Mitchell, in his "Travels," vol. ii, p. 357.<br>
2. I have described these very curious banks in the Appendix to my
volume on the structure of Coral-Reefs. I have ascertained the
inclination of the edges of the banks, from information given me by
Captain B. Allen, one of the surveyors, and by carefully measuring
the horizontal distances between the last sounding on the bank and
the first in the deep water. Widely extended banks in all parts of
the West Indies have the same general form of surface.</p>

<p>curves, like gigantic tidal ripples, the tops of which have
since been cut off, either by nearly horizontal layers, or by
another set of great ripples, the folds of which do not exactly
coincide with those below them. It is well-known to surveyors that
mud and sand are disturbed during storms at considerable depths, at
least from three hundred to four hundred and fifty
feet,<sup>1</sup> so that the nature of the bottom even becomes
temporarily changed; the bottom, also, at a depth between sixty and
seventy feet, has been observed<sup>2</sup> to be broadly rippled.
One may, therefore, be allowed to suspect, from the appearance just
mentioned in the New Red Sandstone, that at greater depths, the bed
of the ocean is heaped up during gales into great ripple-like
furrows and depressions, which are afterwards cut off by the
currents during more tranquil weather, and again furrowed during
gales.</p>

<p><i>Valleys in the sandstone platforms.</i>&mdash;The grand
valleys, by which the Blue Mountains and the other sandstone
platforms of this part of Australia are penetrated, and which long
offered an insuperable obstacle to the attempts of the most
enterprising colonist to reach the interior country, form the most
striking feature in the geology of New South Wales. They are of
grand dimensions, and are bordered by continuous links of lofty
cliffs. It is not easy to conceive a more magnificent spectacle,
than is presented to a person walking on the summit- plains, when
without any notice he arrives at the brink of one of these cliffs,
which are so perpendicular, that he can strike with a stone (as I
have tried) the trees growing, at the depth of between one thousand
and one thousand five hundred feet below him; on both hands he sees
headland beyond headland of the receding line of cliff, and on the
opposite side of the valley, often at the distance of several
miles, he beholds another line rising up to the same height with
that on which he stands, and formed of the same horizontal strata
of pale sandstone. The bottoms of these valleys are moderately
level, and the fall of the rivers flowing in them, according to Sir
T. Mitchell, is gentle. The main valleys often send into the
platform great baylike arms, which expand at their upper ends; and
on the other hand, the platform often sends promontories into the
valley, and even leaves in them great, almost insulated, masses. So
continuous are the bounding lines of cliff, that to descend into
some of these valleys, it is necessary to go round twenty miles;
and into others, the surveyors have only lately penetrated, and the
colonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle. But the
most remarkable point of structure in these valleys, is, that
although several miles wide in their upper parts, they generally
contract towards their mouths to such a degree as to become
impassable. The Surveyor-General, Sir T. Mitchell,<sup>3</sup> in
vain endeavoured, first on foot and then by crawling between the
great fallen</p>

<p>fragments of sandstone, to ascend through the gorge by which the
river Grose joins the Nepean; yet the valley of the Grose in its
upper part, as I saw, forms a magnificent basin some miles in
width, and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs, the summits of
which are believed to be nowhere less than 3,000 feet above the
level of the sea. When cattle are driven into the valley of the
Wolgan by a path (which I descended) partly cut by the colonists,
they cannot escape; for this valley is in every other part
surrounded by perpendicular cliffs, and eight miles lower down, it
contracts, from an average width of half a mile, to a mere chasm
impassable to man or beast. Sir T. Mitchell<sup>1</sup> states,
that the great valley of the Cox river with all its branches
contracts, where it unites with the Nepean, into a gorge 2,200
yards wide, and about one thousand feet in depth. Other similar
cases might have been added.</p>

<p>The first impression, from seeing the correspondence of the
horizontal strata, on each side of these valleys and great
amphitheatre-like depressions, is that they have been in chief part
hollowed out, like other valleys, by aqueous erosion; but when one
reflects on the enormous amount of stone, which on this view must
have been removed, in most of the above cases through mere gorges
or chasms, one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have
subsided. But considering the form of the irregularly branching
valleys, and of the narrow promontories, projecting into them from
the platforms, we are compelled to abandon this notion. To
attribute these hollows to alluvial action, would be preposterous;
nor does the drainage from the summit-level always fall, as I
remarked near the Weatherboard, into the head of these valleys, but
into one side of their bay-like recesses. Some of the inhabitants
remarked to me, that they never viewed one of these baylike
recesses, with the headlands receding on both hands, without being
struck with their resemblance to a bold sea-coast. This is
certainly the case; moreover, the numerous fine harbours, with
their widely branching arms, on the present coast of New South
Wales, which are generally connected with the sea by a narrow
mouth, from one mile to a quarter of a mile in width, passing
through the sandstone coast-cliffs, present a likeness, though on a
miniature scale, to the great valleys of the interior. But then
immediately occurs the startling difficulty, why has the sea worn
out these great, though circumscribed, depressions on a wide
platform, and left mere gorges, through which the whole vast amount
of triturated matter must have been carried away? The only light I
can throw on this enigma, is by showing that banks appear to be
forming in some seas of the most irregular forms, and that the
sides of such banks are so steep (as before stated) that a
comparatively small amount of subsequent erosion would form them
into cliffs: that the waves have power to form high and precipitous
cliffs, even in landlocked harbours, I have observed in many parts
of South America. In the Red Sea, banks with an extremely irregular
outline and composed of sediment, are penetrated by the most
singularly shaped creeks with narrow mouths: this is likewise the
case, though on a larger scale,</p>

<p>with the Bahama Banks. Such banks, I have been led to
suppose,<sup>1</sup> have been formed by currents heaping sediment
on an irregular bottom. That in some cases, the sea, instead of
spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet, heaps it round submarine
rocks and islands, it is hardly possible to doubt, after having
examined the charts of the West Indies. To apply these ideas to the
sandstone platforms of New South Wales, I imagine that the strata
might have been heaped on an irregular bottom by the action of
strong currents, and of the undulations of an open sea; and that
the valley-like spaces thus left unfilled might, during a slow
elevation of the land, have had their steeply sloping flanks worn
into cliffs; the worn-down sandstone being removed, either at the
time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating sea, or
subsequently by alluvial action.</p>

<br>
<center><i>Van Diemen's Land.</i></center>

<p>The southern part of this island is mainly formed of mountains
of greenstone, which often assumes a syenitic character, and
contains much hypersthene. These mountains, in their lower half,
are generally encased by strata containing numerous small corals
and some shells. These shells have been examined by Mr. G. B.
Sowerby, and have been described by him: they consist of two
species of Producta, and of six of Spirifera; two of these, namely,
<i>P. rugata</i> and <i>S. rotundata</i>, resemble, as far as their
imperfect condition allows of comparison, British
mountain-limestone shells. Mr. Lonsdale has had the kindness to
examine the corals; they consist of six undescribed species,
belonging to three genera. Species of these genera occur in the
Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata of Europe. Mr.
Lonsdale remarks, that all these fossils have undoubtedly a
Pal&aelig;ozoic character, and that probably they correspond in age
to a division of the system above the Silurian formations.</p>

<p>The strata containing these remains are singular from the
extreme variability of their mineralogical composition. Every
intermediate form is present, between flinty-slate, clay-slate
passing into grey wacke, pure limestone, sandstone, and porcellanic
rock; and some of the beds can only be described as composed of a
siliceo-calcareo-clay-slate. The formation, as far as I could
judge, is at least a thousand feet in thickness: the upper few
hundred feet usually consist of a siliceous sandstone, containing
pebbles and no organic remains; the inferior strata, of which a
pale flinty slate is perhaps the most abundant, are the most
variable; and these chiefly abound with the remains. Between two
beds of hard crystalline limestone, near Newtown, a layer of white
soft calcareous matter is quarried, and is used for whitewashing
houses. From information given to me by Mr. Frankland, the
Surveyor-General,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. See the "Appendix" to the Part on Coral-Reefs.
The fact of the sea heaping up mud round a submarine nucleus, is
worthy of the notice of geologists: for outlyers of the same
composition with the coast banks are thus formed; and these, if
upheaved and worn into cliffs, would naturally be thought to have
been once connected together.</p>

<p>it appears that this Pal&aelig;ozoic formation is found in
different parts of the whole island; from the same authority, I may
add, that on the north-eastern coast and in Bass' Straits primary
rocks extensively occur.</p>

<p>The shores of Storm Bay are skirted, to the height of a few
hundred feet, by strata of sandstone, containing pebbles of the
formation just described, with its characteristic fossils, and
therefore belonging to a subsequent age. These strata of sandstone
often pass into shale, and alternate with layers of impure coal;
they have in many places been violently disturbed. Near Hobart
Town, I observed one dike, nearly a hundred yards in width, on one
side of which the strata were tilted at an angle of 60 degrees, and
on the other they were in some parts vertical, and had been altered
by the effects of the heat. On the west side of Storm Bay, I found
these strata capped by streams of basaltic lava with olivine; and
close by there was a mass of brecciated scori&aelig;, containing
pebbles of lava, which probably marks the place of an ancient
submarine crater. Two of these streams of basalt were separated
from each other by a layer of argillaceous wacke, which could be
traced passing into partially altered scori&aelig;. The wacke
contained numerous rounded grains of a soft, grass-green mineral,
with a waxy lustre, and translucent on its edges: under the
blowpipe it instantly blackened, and the points fused into a
strongly magnetic, black enamel. In these characters, it resembles
those masses of decomposed olivine, described at St. Jago in the
Cape de Verde group; and I should have thought that it had thus
originated, had I not found a similar substance, in cylindrical
threads, within the cells of the vesicular basalt,&mdash;a state
under which olivine never appears; this substance, I believe, would
be classed as bole by mineralogists.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><i>Travertin with extinct plants.</i>&mdash;Behind Hobart Town
there is a small quarry of a hard travertin, the lower strata of
which abound with distinct impressions of leaves. Mr. Robert Brown
has had the kindness to look at my specimens, and he informed me
that there are four or five kinds, none of which he recognises as
belonging to existing species. The most remarkable leaf is palmate,
like that of a fan- palm, and no plant having leaves of this
structure has hitherto been discovered in Van Diemen's Land. The
other leaves do not resemble the most usual form of the Eucalyptus
(of which tribe the existing forests are chiefly composed), nor do
they resemble that class of exceptions to the common form of the
leaves of the Eucalyptus, which occur in this island. The travertin
containing this remnant of a lost vegetation, is of a pale yellow
colour, hard, and in parts even crystalline; but not compact, and
is everywhere penetrated by minute, tortuous, cylindrical pores. It
contains a very few pebbles of quartz, and occasionally layers of
chalcedonic nodules, like those of chert in our Greensand. From</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Chloroph&aelig;ite, described by Dr. MacCulloch
("Western Islands," vol. i, p. 504) as occurring in a basaltic
amygdaloid, differs from this substance, in remaining unchanged
before the blowpipe, and in blackening from exposure to the air.
May we suppose that olivine, in undergoing the remarkable change
described at St. Jago, passes through several states?</p>

<p>the pureness of this calcareous rock, it has been searched for
in other places, but has never been found. From this circumstance,
and from the character of the deposit, it was probably formed by a
calcareous spring entering a small pool or narrow creek. The strata
have subsequently been tilted and fissured; and the surface has
been covered by a singular mass, with which, also, a large fissure
has been filled up, formed of balls of trap embedded in a mixture
of wacke and a white, earthy, alumino-calcareous substance. Hence
it would appear, as if a volcanic eruption had taken place on the
borders of the pool, in which the calcareous matter was depositing,
and had broken it up and drained it.</p>

<p><i>Elevation of the land.</i>&mdash;Both the eastern and western
shores of the bay, in the neighbourhood of Hobart Town, are in most
parts covered to the height of thirty feet above the level of
high-water mark, with broken shells, mingled with pebbles. The
colonists attribute these shells to the aborigines having carried
them up for food: undoubtedly, there are many large mounds, as was
pointed out to me by Mr. Frankland, which have been thus formed;
but I think from the numbers of the shells, from their frequent
small size, from the manner in which they are thinly scattered, and
from some appearances in the form of the land, that we must
attribute the presence of the greater number to a small elevation
of the land. On the shore of Ralph Bay (opening into Storm Bay) I
observed a continuous beach about fifteen feet above high-water
mark, clothed with vegetation, and by digging into it, pebbles
encrusted with Serpul&aelig; were found: along the banks, also, of
the river Derwent, I found a bed of broken sea-shells above the
surface of the river, and at a point where the water is now much
too fresh for sea-shells to live; but in both these cases, it is
just possible, that before certain spits of sand and banks of mud
in Storm Bay were accumulated, the tides might have risen to the
height where we now find the shells.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Evidence more or less distinct of a change of level between the
land and water, has been detected on almost all the land on this
side of the globe. Captain Grey, and other travellers, have found
in Southern Australia upraised shells, belonging either to the
recent, or to a late tertiary period. The French naturalists in
Baudin's expedition, found shells similarly circumstanced on the
S.W. coast of Australia. The Rev. W. B. Clarke<sup>2</sup> finds
proofs of the elevation of the land, to the amount of 400 feet, at
the Cape of Good Hope. In the neighbourhood</p>

<p class="fnote">1. It would appear that some changes are now in
progress in Ralph Bay, for I was assured by an intelligent farmer,
that oysters were formerly abundant in it, but that about the year
1834 they had, without any apparent cause, disappeared. In the
"Transactions of the Maryland Academy" (vol. i, part i, p. 28)
there is an account by Mr. Ducatel of vast beds of oysters and
clams having been destroyed by the gradual filling up of the
shallow lagoons and channels, on the shores of the southern United
States. At Chiloe, in South America, I heard of a similar loss,
sustained by the inhabitants, in the disappearance from one part of
the coast of an edible species of Ascidia.<br>

<p>of the Bay of Islands in New Zealand,<sup>1</sup> I observed
that the shores were scattered to some height, as at Van Diemen's
Land, with sea-shells, which the colonists attribute to the
natives. Whatever may have been the origin of these shells, I
cannot doubt, after having seen a section of the valley of the
Thames River (37 degrees S.), drawn by the Rev. W. Williams, that
the land has been there elevated: on the opposite sides of this
great valley, three step-like terraces, composed of an enormous
accumulation of rounded pebbles, exactly correspond with each
other: the escarpment of each terrace is about fifty feet in
height. No one after having examined the terraces in the valleys on
the western shores of South America, which are strewed with
sea-shells, and have been formed during intervals of rest in the
slow elevation of the land, could doubt that the New Zealand
terraces have been similarly formed. I may add, that Dr.
Dieffenbach, in his description of the Chatham Islands<sup>2</sup>
(S.W. of New Zealand), states that it is manifest "that the sea has
left many places bare which were once covered by its waters."</p>

<br>
<center><i>King George's Sound.</i></center>

<p>This settlement is situated at the south-western angle of the
Australian continent: the whole country is granitic, with the
constituent minerals sometimes obscurely arranged in straight or
curved lamin&aelig;. In these cases, the rock would be called by
Humboldt, gneiss-granite, and it is remarkable that the form of the
bare conical hills, appearing to be composed of great folding
layers, strikingly resembles, on a small scale, those composed of
gneiss-granite at Rio de Janeiro, and those described by Humboldt
at Venezuela. These plutonic rocks are, in many places, intersected
by trappean-dikes; in one place, I found ten parallel dikes ranging
in an E. and W. line; and not far off another set of eight dikes,
composed of a different variety of trap, ranging at right angles to
the former ones. I have observed in several primary districts, the
occurrence of systems of dikes parallel and close to each
other.</p>

<p><i>Superficial ferruginous beds.</i>&mdash;The lower parts of
the country are everywhere covered by a bed, following the
inequalities of the surface,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I will here give a catalogue of the rocks which
I met with near the Bay of Islands, in New Zealand:&mdash;1st, Much
basaltic lava, and scoriform rocks, forming distinct
craters;&mdash;2nd, A castellated hill of horizontal strata of
flesh-coloured limestone, showing when fractured distinct
crystalline facets: the rain has acted on this rock in a remarkable
manner, corroding its surface into a miniature model of an Alpine

the bed of a stream, pebbles of clay-slate;&mdash;3rd, The shores
of the Bay of Islands are formed of a feldspathic rock, of a
bluish-grey colour, often much decomposed, with an angular
fracture, and crossed by numerous ferruginous seams, but without
any distinct stratification or cleavage. Some varieties are highly
crystalline, and would at once be pronounced to be trap; others
strikingly resembled clay-slate, slightly altered by heat: I was
unable to form any decided opinion on this formation.<br>

<p>of a honeycombed sandstone, abounding with oxides of iron. Beds
of nearly similar composition are common, I believe, along the
whole western coast of Australia, and on many of the East Indian
islands. At the Cape of Good Hope, at the base of the mountains
formed of granite and capped with sandstone, the ground is
everywhere coated either by a fine-grained, rubbly, ochraceous
mass, like that at King George's Sound, or by a coarser sandstone
with fragments of quartz, and rendered hard and heavy by an
abundance of the hydrate of iron, which presents, when freshly
broken, a metallic lustre. Both these varieties have a very
irregular texture, including spaces either rounded or angular, full
of loose sand: from this cause the surface is always honeycombed.
The oxide of iron is most abundant on the edges of the cavities,
where alone it affords a metallic fracture. In these formations, as
well as in many true sedimentary deposits, it is evident that iron
tends to become aggregated, either in the form of a shell, or of a
network. The origin of these superficial beds, though sufficiently
obscure, seems to be due to alluvial action on detritus abounding
with iron.</p>

<p><i>Superficial calcareous deposit.</i>&mdash;A calcareous
deposit on the summit of Bald Head, containing branched bodies,
supposed by some authors to have been corals, has been celebrated
by the descriptions of many distinguished voyagers.<sup>1</sup> It
folds round and conceals irregular hummocks of granite, at the
height of 600 feet above the level of the sea. It varies much in
thickness; where stratified, the beds are often inclined at high
angles, even as much as at thirty degrees, and they dip in all
directions. These beds are sometimes crossed by oblique and
even-sided lamin&aelig;. The deposit consists either of a fine,
white calcareous powder, in which not a trace of structure can be
discovered, or of exceedingly minute, rounded grains, of brown,
yellowish, and purplish colours; both varieties being generally,
but not always, mixed with small particles of quartz, and being
cemented into a more or less perfect stone. The rounded calcareous
grains, when heated in a slight degree, instantly lose their
colours; in this and in every other respect, closely resembling
those minute, equal- sized particles of shells and corals, which at
St. Helena have been drifted up the side of the mountains, and have
thus been winnowed of all coarser fragments. I cannot doubt that
the coloured calcareous particles here have had a similar origin.
The impalpable powder has probably been derived from the decay of
the rounded particles; this certainly is possible, for on the coast
of Peru, I have traced <i>large unbroken</i> shells gradually
falling into a substance as fine as powdered chalk. Both of the
above-mentioned varieties of calcareous sandstone frequently
alternate with, and blend into, thin layers of a hard
substalagmitic<sup>2</sup> rock, which, even</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I visited this hill, in company with Captain
Fitzroy, and we came to a similar conclusion regarding these
branching bodies.<br>
2. I adopt this term from Lieutenant Nelson's excellent paper on
the Bermuda Islands ("Geolog. Trans.," vol. v, p. 106), for the
hard, compact, cream- or brown-coloured stone, without any
crystalline structure, which so often accompanies superficial
calcareous accumulations. I have observed such superficial beds,
coated with substalagmitic rock, at the Cape of Good Hope, in
several parts of Chile, and over wide spaces in La Plata and
Patagonia. Some of these beds have been formed from decayed shells,
but the origin of the greater number is sufficiently obscure. The
causes which determine water to dissolve lime, and then soon to
redeposit it, are not, I think, known. The surface of the
substalagmitic layers appears always to be corroded by the
rain-water. As all the above-mentioned countries have a long dry
season, compared with the rainy one, I should have thought that the
presence of the substalagmitic was connected with the climate, had
not Lieutenant Nelson found this substance forming under sea-water.
Disintegrated shell seems to be extremely soluble; of which I found
good evidence, in a curious rock at Coquimbo in Chile, which
consisted of small, pellucid, empty husks, cemented together. A
series of specimens clearly showed that these husks had originally
contained small rounded particles of shells, which had been
enveloped and cemented together by calcareous matter (as often
happens on sea-beaches), and which subsequently had decayed, and
been dissolved by water, that must have penetrated through the
calcareous husks, without corroding them,&mdash;of which processes
every stage could be seen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 261">page 261</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>when the stone on each side contains particles of quartz, is
entirely free from them: hence we must suppose that these layers,
as well as certain vein-like masses, have been formed by rain
dissolving the calcareous matter and re-precipitating it, as has
happened at St. Helena. Each layer probably marks a fresh surface,
when the, now firmly cemented, particles existed as loose sand.
These layers are sometimes brecciated and re-cemented, as if they
had been broken by the slipping of the sand when soft. I did not
find a single fragment of a sea-shell; but bleached shells of the
<i>Helix melo</i>, an existing land species, abound in all the
strata; and I likewise found another Helix, and the case of an
Oniscus.</p>

<p>The branches are absolutely undistinguishable in shape from the
broken and upright stumps of a thicket; their roots are often
uncovered, and are seen to diverge on all sides; here and there a
branch lies prostrate. The branches generally consist of the
sandstone, rather firmer than the surrounding matter, with the
central parts filled, either with friable, calcareous matter, or
with a substalagmitic variety; this central part is also frequently
penetrated by linear crevices, sometimes, though rarely, containing
a trace of woody matter. These calcareous, branching bodies, appear
to have been formed by fine calcareous matter being washed into the
casts or cavities, left by the decay of branches and roots of
thickets, buried under drifted sand. The whole surface of the hill
is now undergoing disintegration, and hence the casts, which are
compact and hard, are left projecting. In calcareous sand at the
Cape of Good Hope, I found the casts, described by Abel, quite
similar to these at Bald Head; but their centres are often filled
with black carbonaceous matter not yet removed. It is not
surprising, that the woody matter should have been almost entirely
removed from the casts on Bald Head; for it is certain, that many
centuries must have elapsed since the thickets were buried; at
present, owing to the form and height of the narrow promontory, no
sand is drifted up, and the whole surface, as I have remarked, is
wearing away. We must, therefore,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 262">page 262</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>look back to a period when the land stood lower, of which the
French naturalists<sup>1</sup> found evidence in upraised shells of
recent species, for the drifting on Bald Head of the calcareous and
quartzose sand, and the consequent embedment of the vegetable
remains. There was only one appearance which at first made me doubt
concerning the origin of the cast,&mdash;namely, that the finer
roots from different stems sometimes became united together into
upright plates or veins; but when the manner is borne in mind in
which fine roots often fill up cracks in hard earth, and that these
roots would decay and leave hollows, as well as the stems, there is
no real difficulty in this case. Besides the calcareous branches
from the Cape of Good Hope, I have seen casts, of exactly the same
forms, from Madeira<sup>2</sup> and from Bermuda; at this latter
place, the surrounding calcareous rocks, judging from the specimens
collected by Lieutenant Nelson, are likewise similar, as is their
subaerial formation. Reflecting on the stratification of the
deposit on Bald Head,&mdash;on the irregularly alternating layers
of substalagmitic rock,&mdash;on the uniformly sized, and rounded
particles, apparently of sea-shells and corals,&mdash;on the
abundance of land-shells throughout the mass,&mdash;and finally, on
the absolute resemblance of the calcareous casts, to the stumps,
roots, and branches of that kind of vegetation, which would grow on
sand-hillocks, I think there can be no reasonable doubt,
notwithstanding the different opinion of some authors, that a true
view of their origin has been here given.</p>

<p>Calcareous deposits, like these of King George's Sound, are of
vast extent on the Australian shores. Dr. Fitton remarks, that
"recent calcareous breccia (by which term all these deposits are
included) was found during Baudin's voyage, over a space of no less
than twenty-five degrees</p>

<p class="fnote">1. See M. P&eacute;ron's "Voyage," tome i, p.
204.<br>
 2. Dr. J. Macaulay has fully described (<i>Edinb. New Phil.
Journ.,</i> vol. xxix, p. 350) the casts from Madeira. He considers
(differently from Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill) these bodies to be
corals, and the calcareous deposit to be of subaqueous origin. His
arguments chiefly rest (for his remarks on their structure are
vague) on the great quantity of the calcareous matter, and on the
casts containing animal matter, as shown by their evolving ammonia.
Had Dr. Macaulay seen the enormous masses of rolled particles of
shells and corals on the beach of Ascension, and especially on
coral-reefs; and had he reflected on the effects of long-continued,
gentle winds, in drifting up the finer particles, he would hardly
have advanced the argument of quantity, which is seldom trustworthy
in geology. If the calcareous matter has originated from
disintegrated shells and corals, the presence of animal matter is
what might have been expected. Mr. Anderson analysed for Dr.
Macaulay part of a cast, and he found it composed of&mdash;<br>

<p>of latitude and an equal extent of longitude, on the southern,
western, and north-western coasts."<sup>1</sup> It appears also
from M. Peron, with whose observations and opinions on the origin
of the calcareous matter and branching casts mine entirely accord,
that the deposit is generally much more continuous than near King
George's Sound. At Swan River, Archdeacon Scott<sup>2</sup> states
that in one part it extends ten miles inland. Captain Wickham,
moreover, informs me that during his late survey of the western
coast, the bottom of the sea, wherever the vessel anchored, was
ascertained, by crowbars being let down, to consist of white
calcareous matter. Hence it seems that along this coast, as at
Bermuda and at Keeling Atoll, submarine and subaerial deposits are
contemporaneously in process of formation, from the disintegration
of marine organic bodies. The extent of these deposits, considering
their origin, is very striking; and they can be compared in this
respect only with the great coral-reefs of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans. In other parts of the world, for instance in South America,
there are <i>superficial</i> calcareous deposits of great extent,
in which not a trace of organic structure is discoverable; these
observations would lead to the inquiry, whether such deposits may
not, also, have been formed from disintegrated shells and
corals.</p>

<br>
<center><i>Cape of Good Hope.</i></center>

<p>After the accounts given by Barrow, Carmichael, Basil Hall, and
W. B. Clarke of the geology of this district, I shall confine
myself to a few observations on the junction of the three principal
formations. The fundamental rock is granite,<sup>3</sup> overlaid
by clay-slate: the latter is generally hard, and glossy from
containing minute scales of mica; it alternates with, and passes
into, beds of slightly crystalline, feldspathic, slaty rock. This
clay-slate is remarkable from being in some places (as on the
Lion's Rump) decomposed, even to the depth of twenty feet, into a
pale-coloured, sandstone-like rock, which has been mistaken, I
believe, by some observers, for a separate formation. I was guided
by Dr. Andrew Smith to a fine junction at Green Point between the
granite and clay-slate: the latter at the distance of a quarter of
a mile</p>

<p class="fnote">1. For ample details on this formation consult Dr.
Fitton's "Appendix to Captain King's Voyage." Dr. Fitton is
inclined to attribute a concretionary origin to the branching
bodies: I may remark, that I have seen in beds of sand in La Plata
cylindrical stems which no doubt thus originated; but they differed
much in appearance from these at Bald Head, and the other places
above specified.<br>
2. "Proceedings of the Geolog. Soc.," vol. i, p. 320.<br>
3. In several places I observed in the granite, small dark-coloured
balls, composed of minute scales of black mica in a tough basis. In
another place, I found crystals of black schorl radiating from a
common centre. Dr. Andrew Smith found, in the interior parts of the
country, some beautiful specimens of granite, with silvery mica
radiating or rather branching, like moss, from central points. At
the Geological Society, there are specimens of granite with
crystallised feldspar branching and radiating in like manner.</p>

<p>from the spot, where the granite appears on the beach (though,
probably, the granite is much nearer underground), becomes slightly
more compact and crystalline. At a less distance, some of the beds
of clay-slate are of a homogeneous texture, and obscurely striped
with different zones of colour, whilst others are obscurely
spotted. Within a hundred yards of the first vein of granite, the
clay-slate consists of several varieties; some compact with a tinge
of purple, others glistening with numerous minute scales of mica
and imperfectly crystallised feldspar; some obscurely granular,
others porphyritic with small, elongated spots of a soft white
mineral, which being easily corroded, gives to this variety a
vesicular appearance. Close to the granite, the clay-slate is
changed into a dark-coloured, laminated rock, having a granular
fracture, which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar, coated by
minute, brilliant scales of mica.</p>

<p>The actual junction between the granitic and clay-slate
districts extends over a width of about two hundred yards, and
consists of irregular masses and of numerous dikes of granite,
entangled and surrounded by the clay- slate: most of the dikes
range in a N.W. and S.E. line, parallel to the cleavage of the
slate. As we leave the junction, thin beds, and lastly, mere films
of the altered clay-slate are seen, quite isolated, as if floating,
in the coarsely crystallised granite; but although completely
detached, they all retain traces of the uniform N.W. and S.E.
cleavage. This fact has been observed in other similar cases, and
has been advanced by some eminent geologists,<sup>1</sup> as a
great difficulty on the ordinary theory, of granite having been
injected whilst liquified; but if we reflect on the probable state
of the lower surface of a laminated mass, like clay-slate, after
having been violently arched by a body of molten granite, we may
conclude that it would be full of fissures parallel to the planes
of cleavage; and that these would be filled with granite, so that
wherever the fissures were close to each other, mere parting layers
or wedges of the slate would depend into the granite. Should,
therefore, the whole body of rock afterwards become worn down and
denuded, the lower ends of these dependent masses or wedges of
slate would be left quite isolated in the granite; yet they would
retain their proper lines of cleavage, from having been united,
whilst the granite was fluid, with a continuous covering of
clay-slate.</p>

<p>Following, in company with Dr. A. Smith, the line of junction
between the granite and the slate, as it stretched inland, in a
S.E. direction, we came to a place, where the slate was converted
into a fine-grained, perfectly characterised gneiss, composed of
yellow-brown granular feldspar, of abundant black brilliant mica,
and of few and thin lamin&aelig; of quartz. From the abundance of
the mica in this gneiss, compared with the small quantity and
excessively minute scales, in which it exists in the glossy
clay-slate, we must conclude, that it has been here formed by the
metamorphic action&mdash;a circumstance doubted, under nearly
similar circumstances, by some authors. The lamin&aelig; of the
clay-slate are straight; and it was interesting to observe, that as
they assumed</p>

<p class="fnote">1. See M. Keilhau's "Theory on Granite" translated
in the <i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,</i> vol.xxiv, p.
402.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the character of gneiss, they became undulatory with some of the
smaller flexures angular, like the lamin&aelig; of many true
metamorphic schists.</p>

<p><i>Sandstone formation.</i>&mdash;This formation makes the most
imposing feature in the geology of Southern Africa. The strata are
in many parts horizontal, and attain a thickness of about two
thousand feet. The sandstone varies in character; it contains
little earthy matter, but is often stained with iron; some of the
beds are very fine-grained and quite white; others are as compact
and homogeneous as quartz rock. In some places I observed a breccia
of quartz, with the fragments almost dissolved in a siliceous
paste. Broad veins of quartz, often including large and perfect
crystals, are very numerous; and it is evident in nearly all the
strata, that silica has been deposited from solution in remarkable
quantity. Many of the varieties of quartzite appeared quite like
metamorphic rocks; but from the upper strata being as siliceous as
the lower, and from the undisturbed junctions with the granite,
which in many places can be examined, I can hardly believe that
these sandstone-strata have been exposed to heat.<sup>1</sup> On
the lines of junction between these two great formations, I found
in several places the granite decayed to the depth of a few inches,
and succeeded, either by a thin layer of ferruginous shale, or by
four or five inches in thickness of the re-cemented crystals of the
granite, on which the great pile of sandstone immediately
rested.</p>

<p>Mr. Schomburgk has described<sup>2</sup> a great sandstone
formation in Northern Brazil, resting on granite, and resembling to
a remarkable degree, in composition and in the external form of the
land, this formation of the Cape of Good Hope. The sandstones of
the great platforms of Eastern Australia, which also rest on
granite, differ in containing more earthy and less siliceous
matter. No fossil remains have been discovered in these three vast
deposits. Finally, I may add that I did not see any boulders of
far-transported rocks at the Cape of Good Hope, or on the eastern
and western shores of Australia, or at Van Diemen's Land. In the
northern island of New Zealand, I noticed some large blocks of
greenstone, but whether their parent rock was far distant, I had no
opportunity of determining.</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The Rev. W. B. Clarke, however, states, to my
surprise ("Geolog. Proceedings," vol. iii, p. 422), that the
sandstone in some parts is penetrated by granitic dikes: such dikes
must belong to an epoch altogether subsequent to that when the
molten granite acted on the clay-slate.<br>
