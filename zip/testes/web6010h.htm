<h1>
Peter's First Letter
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Peter, an apostle of Jesus
Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion
in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> according to the foreknowledge of
God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus
Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be
multiplied.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> Blessed be the
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy
became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead,  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> to
an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away,
reserved in Heaven for you,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> who by the power of God are
guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Wherein you greatly
rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to
grief in various trials,  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> that the proof of your faith,
which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by
fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation
of Jesus Christ-- <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> whom not
having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet
believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of
glory-- <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> receiving the
result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Concerning this salvation, the
prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that
would come to you,  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> searching for who or what kind of
time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he
predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow
them.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> To them it was
revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these
things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached
the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things
angels desire to look into.
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Therefore, <a
href="#N1">prepare your minds for action,</a> be sober and set your hope
fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus
Christ-- <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> as children of
obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in
your ignorance,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> but just
as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your
behavior;  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> because it is
written, &quot;You shall be holy; for I am holy.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> If you call on him as Father, who
without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the
time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> knowing that you were redeemed,
not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of
life handed down from your fathers,  <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> but with precious blood, as of a
faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;  <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> who was foreknown indeed before
the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your
sake,  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> who through him are
believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so
that your faith and hope might be in God.
<p> <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> Seeing you have
purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in
sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:
 <a name="C1V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:23</font></a> having been born again,
not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God,
which lives and remains forever.  <a name="C1V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:24</font></a> For,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;All flesh is like grass,
<dd>and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass.
<dt>The grass withers, and its flower falls;
<dd> <a name="C1V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:25</font></a> but the Lord's word
endures forever.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Putting away therefore
all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
 <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> as newborn babies, long
for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> if indeed you have tasted that the
Lord is gracious:  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> coming
to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God,
precious.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> You also, as
living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood,
to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
 <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Because it is contained in
Scripture,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious:
<dd>He who believes in him will not be disappointed.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> For you who believe
therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;The stone which the builders rejected,
<dd>has become the chief cornerstone,&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> and,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they
were appointed.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> But you
are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's
own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you
out of darkness into his marvelous light:  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> who in time past were no people,
but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have
obtained mercy.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Beloved,
I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which
war against the soul;  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> having good behavior among the
nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evil-doers, they
may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of
visitation.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> Therefore
subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether
to the king, as supreme;  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> or to governors, as sent by him
for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> For this is the will of God, that
by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
 <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> as free, and not using
your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
<p> <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> Honor all men. Love
the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> Servants, be in subjection to
your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to
the wicked.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> For it is
commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of
conscience toward God.  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> For what glory is it if, when you
sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently
endure suffering, this is commendable with God.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> For to this you were called,
because Christ also suffered for us, leaving <a href="#N7">you</a> an
example, that you should follow his steps,  <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> who did not sin, &quot;neither
was deceit found in his mouth.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> Who, when he was cursed, didn't
curse back. When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to
him who judges righteously;  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> who his own self bore our sins in
his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to
righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> For you were going astray like
sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and <a
href="#N9">Overseer</a> of your souls.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> In like manner, wives,
be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any don't obey the
Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;
 <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> seeing your pure behavior
in fear.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Let your beauty
be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing
jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> but in the hidden person of the
heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which
is in the sight of God very precious.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> For this is how the holy women
before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to
their own husbands:  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> as
Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you
do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
<p> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> You husbands, in like
manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the
woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of
life; that your prayers may not be hindered.
<p> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Finally, be all
like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,
 <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> not rendering evil for
evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; knowing that to this
were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> For,
<dl>
<dt>&quot;He who would love life,
<dd>and see good days,
<dt>let him keep his tongue from evil,
<dd>and his lips from speaking deceit.
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> Let him turn away
from evil, and do good.
<dd>Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> For the eyes of the
Lord are on the righteous,
<dd>and his ears open to their prayer;
<dd>but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&quot;<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N10">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> Now who is he who will
harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But even if you should suffer for
righteousness' sake, you are blessed. &quot;Don't fear what they fear,
neither be troubled.&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> But sanctify the Lord God in your
hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a
reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> having a good conscience; that,
while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who
curse your good manner of life in Christ.  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> For it is better, if it is God's
will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Because Christ also suffered for
sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to
God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
 <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> in which he also went and
preached to the spirits in prison,  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> who before were disobedient, when
God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built.
In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.  <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> This is a symbol of baptism,
which now saves you--not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ,  <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> who is at
the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and
powers being made subject to him.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Forasmuch then as
Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same
mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> that you no longer should live the
rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of
God.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For we have spent
enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having
walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and
abominable idolatries.  <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> They think it is strange that you
don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> who will give account to him who
is ready to judge the living and the dead.  <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> For to this end the Good News was
preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the
flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> But the end of all things is near.
Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> And above all things be earnest in
your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Be hospitable to one another
without grumbling.  <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> As
each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good
managers of the grace of God in its various forms.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> If anyone speaks, let it be as it
were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength
which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus
Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> Beloved, don't be
astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as
though a strange thing happened to you.  <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> But because you are partakers of
Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also
may rejoice with exceeding joy.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> If you are insulted for the name
of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests
on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.
 <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> For let none of you
suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other
men's matters.  <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> But if one
of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him
glorify God in this matter.  <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> For the time has come for
judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us,
what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God?  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> &quot;If it is hard for the
righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the
sinner?&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Therefore let them also who
suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to
him, as to a faithful Creator.
<p> <a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> I exhort the elders
among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.  <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> Shepherd the flock of God which is
among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but
voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;  <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> neither as lording it over those
entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.  <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> When the chief Shepherd is
revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away.
<p> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> Likewise, you younger
ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with
humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for &quot;God resists the
proud, but gives grace to the humble.&quot;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>  <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> Humble yourselves therefore under
the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;  <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> casting all your worries on him,
because he cares for you.
<p> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> Be sober and
self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like
a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.  <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> Withstand him steadfast in your
faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the
same sufferings.  <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> But may
the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus,
after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen,
and settle you.  <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> To him be
the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> Through Silvanus, our
faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly,
exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you
stand.  <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> She who is in
Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.
 <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> Greet one another with a
kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

<p>This file should be named web6010h.htm or web6010h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web6011h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web6010ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people<br>

Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South<br>
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West<br>

<p>We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones<br>
that have responded.</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.</p>

<p>In answer to various questions we have received on this:</p>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN<br>
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are<br>

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br>
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how<br>
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK<br>
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br>
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from. If you received it<br>
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br>
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br>
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.</p>
