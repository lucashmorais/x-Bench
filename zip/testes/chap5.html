<b>RESPIRATION IN LAND CRABS</b></center>

<p class="one">Among the numerous facts in the natural history of
the Crustacea upon which a new and clear light is thrown by
Darwin&rsquo;s theory, besides the two forms of the males in our
<i>Tanais</i> and in <i>Orchestia Darwinii,</i> there is one which
appears to me of particular importance, namely, the character of
the branchial cavity in the air-breathing Crabs, of which,
unfortunately, I have been unable to investigate some of the most
remarkable (<i>Gecarcinus, Ranina</i>). As this character, namely,
the existence of an entrance behind the branchi&aelig;, has
hitherto been noticed, even as a fact, only in <i>Ranina,</i> I
will go into it in some detail. I have already mentioned that, as
indeed is required by Darwin&rsquo;s theory, this entrant orifice
is produced in different manners in the different families.</p>

<p>In the Frog-crab (<i>Ranina</i>) of the Indian Ocean, which,
according to Rumphius, loves to climb up on the roofs of the
houses, the ordinary anterior entrant orifice is entirely wanting
according to Milne-Edwards, and the entrance of a canal opening
into the hindmost parts of the branchial cavity is situated beneath
the commencement of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The case is most simple in some of the Grapsoid&aelig;, as in
<i>Aratus Pisonii,</i> a charming, lively Crab which ascends the
mangrove bushes (<i>Rhizophora</i>) and gnaws their leaves. By
means of its short but remarkably acute claws, which prick like
pins when it runs over the hand, this Crab climbs with the greatest
agility upon the thinnest twigs. Once, when I had one of these
animals sitting upon my hand, I noticed that it elevated the hinder
part of its carapace, and that by this means a wide fissure was
opened upon each side above the last pair of feet, through which I
could look far into the branchial cavity. I have since been unable
to procure this remarkable animal again, but on the other hand, I
have frequently repeated the same observation upon another animal
of the same family (apparently a true <i>Grapsus</i>), which lives
abundantly upon the rocks of our coast. Whilst the hinder part of
the carapace rises and the above-mentioned fissure is formed, the
anterior part seems to sink, and to narrow or entirely close the
anterior entrant orifice. Under water the elevation of the carapace
never takes place. The animal therefore opens its branchial cavity
in front or behind, according as it has to breathe water or air.
How the elevation of the carapace is effected I do not know, but I
believe that a membranous sac, which extends from the body cavity
far into the branchial cavity beneath the hinder part of the
carapace, is inflated by the impulsion of the fluids of the body,
and the carapace is thereby raised.</p>

<p>I have also observed the same elevation of the carapace in some
species of the allied genera <i>Sesarma</i> and <i>
Cyclograpsus,</i> which dig deep holes in marshy ground, and often
run about upon the wet mud, or sit, as if keeping watch, before
their burrows. One must, however, wait for a long time with these
animals, when taken out of the water, before they open their
branchial cavity to the air, for they possess a wonderful
arrangement, by means of which they can continue to breathe water
for some time when out of the water. The orifices for the egress of
the water which has served for respiration, are situated in these,
as in most Crabs, in the anterior angles of the buccal frame
(&ldquo;cadre buccal,&rdquo; M.-Edw.), whilst the entrant fissures
of the branchial cavity extend from its hinder angles above the
first pair of feet. Now that portion of the carapace which extends
at the sides of the mouth between the two orifices
(&ldquo;r&eacute;gions pt&eacute;rygostomiennes&rdquo;), appears in
our animals to be divided into small square compartments.
Milne-Edwards has already pointed this out as a particularly
remarkable peculiarity. This appearance is caused partly by small
wart-like elevations, and partly and especially by curious
geniculated hairs, which to a certain extent constitute a fine net
or hair-sieve extended immediately over the surface of the
carapace. Thus when a wave of water escapes from the branchial
cavity, it immediately becomes diffused in this network of hairs
and then again conveyed back to the branchial cavity by vigorous
movements of the appendage of the outer maxilliped which works in
the entrant fissure. Whilst the water glides in this way over the
carapace in the form of a thin film, it will again saturate itself
with oxygen, and may then serve afresh for the purposes of
respiration. In order to complete this arrangement the outer
maxillipeds, as indeed has long been known, bear a projecting ridge
furnished with a dense fringe of hairs, which commences in front
near their median line and passes backwards and outwards to the
hinder angle of the buccal frame. Thus the two ridges of the right
and left sides form together a triangle with the apex turned
forwards,&mdash;a breakwater by which the water flowing from the
branchial cavity is kept away from the mouth and reconducted to the
branchial cavity. In very moist air the store of water contained in
the branchial cavity may hold out for hours, and it is only when
this is used up that the animal elevates its carapace in order to
allow the air to have access to its branchi&aelig; from behind.</p>

<p>In <i>Eriphia gonagra</i> the entrant orifices of the
respiratory cavity serving for aerial respiration are situated,
not, as in the Grapsoid&aelig;, above, but behind the last pair of
feet at the sides of the abdomen.</p>

<br>
<p>The swift-footed Sand-Crabs (<i>Ocypoda</i>) are exclusively
terrestrial animals, and can scarcely live for a single day in
water; in a much shorter period a state of complete relaxation
occurs and all voluntary movements cease.<a href="#1."><sup>1</sup></a> In these a
peculiar arrangement on the feet of the third and fourth pairs
(Fig. 12) has long been known, although its connexion with the
branchial cavity has not been suspected. These two pairs of feet
are more closely approximated than the rest; the opposed surfaces
of their basal joints (therefore the hinder surface on the third,
and the anterior surface on the fourth feet) are smooth and
polished, and their margins bear a dense border of long, silky, and
peculiarly formed hairs (Fig. 13). Milne-Edwards who rightly
compares these surfaces, as to their appearance, with articular
surfaces, thinks that they serve to diminish the friction between
the two feet. In considering this interpretation, the question
could not but arise why such an arrangement for the diminution of
friction should be necessary in these particular Crabs and between
these two feet, leaving out of consideration the fact that the
remarkable brushes of hair, which on the other hand must increase
friction, also remain unexplained. But as I was bending the feet of
a large Sand-Crab to and fro in various directions, in order to see
in what movements of the animal friction occurred at the place
indicated, and whether these might, perhaps, be movements of
particular importance to it and such as would frequently recur, I
noticed, when I had stretched the feet widely apart, in the hollow
between them a round orifice of considerable size, through which
air could easily be blown into the branchial cavity, and a fine rod
might even be introduced into it. The orifice opens into the
branchial cavity behind a conical lobe, which stands above the
third foot in place of a branchia which is wanting in <i>
Ocypoda.</i> It is bounded laterally by ridges, which rise above
the articulation of the foot, and to which the lower margin of the
carapace is applied. Exteriorly, also, it is overarched by these
ridges with the exception of a narrow fissure. This fissure is
overlaid by the carapace, which exactly at this part projects
further downwards than elsewhere, and in this way a complete tube
is formed. Whilst in <i>Grapsus</i> the water is allowed to reach
the branchi&aelig; only from the front, I saw it in <i>Ocypoda</i>
flow in also through the orifice just described.</p>

<p>In the position of posterior entrant orifice and the
accompanying peculiarities of the third and fourth pairs of feet,
two other non-aquatic species of the same family, which I have had
the opportunity of examining, agree with <i>Ocypoda.</i> One of
these, perhaps <i>Gelasimus vocans,</i> which lives in the mangrove
swamps, and likes to furnish the mouth of its burrow with a thick,
cylindrical chimney of several inches in height, has the brushes on
the basal joints of the feet in question composed of ordinary
hairs. The other, a smaller <i>Gelasimus,</i> not described in
Milne-Edwards&rsquo; &lsquo;Natural History of Crustacea,&rsquo;
which prefers drier places and is not afraid to run about on the
burning sand under the vertical rays of the noonday sun in
December, but can also endure being in water at least for several
weeks, resembles <i>Ocypoda</i> in having these brushes composed of
non-setiform, delicate hairs, indeed even more delicate and more
regularly constructed than in <i>Ocypoda.</i><a href="#1."><sup>2</sup></a> What may
be the significance of these peculiar hairs,&mdash;whether they
only keep foreign bodies from the branchial cavity,&mdash;whether
they furnish moisture to the air flowing past them,&mdash;or
whether, as their aspect, especially in the small <i>Gelasimus,</i>
reminds one of the olfactory filaments of the Crabs, they may also
perform similar functions,&mdash;are questions the due discussion
of which would lead us too far from our subject. Nevertheless it
may be remarked that in both species, especially in <i>Ocypoda,</i>
the olfactory filaments in their ordinary situation are very much
reduced, and when they are in the water their flagella never
perform the peculiar beating movements which may be observed in
other Crabs, and even in the larger <i>Gelasimus</i>; moreover, the
organ of smell must probably be sought in these air-breathing
Crabs, as in the air-breathing Vertebrata, at the entrance to the
respiratory cavity.</p>

<p>So much for the facts with regard to the aerial respiration of
the Crabs. It has already been indicated why Darwin&rsquo;s theory
requires that when any peculiar arrangements exist for aerial
respiration, these will be differently constructed in different
families. That experience is in perfect accordance with this
requirement is the more in favour of Darwin, because the schoolmen
far from being able to foresee or explain such profound
differences, must rather regard them as extremely surprising. If,
in the nearly allied families of the Ocypodid&aelig; and
Grapsoid&aelig;, the closest agreement prevails in all the
essential conditions of their structure; if the same plan of
structure is slavishly followed in everything else, in the organs
of sense, in the articulation of the limbs, in every trabecula and
tuft of hairs in the complicated framework of the stomach, and in
all the arrangements subserving aquatic respiration, even to the
hairs of the flagella employed in cleaning the
branchi&aelig;,&mdash;why have we suddenly this exception, this
complete difference, in connection with aerial respiration?</p>

<p>The schoolmen will scarcely have an answer for this question,
except by placing themselves on the theologico-teleological
stand-point which has justly fallen into disfavour amongst us, and
from which the mode of production of an arrangement is supposed to
be explained, if its &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; to the animal can be
demonstrated. From this point of view we might certainly say that a
widely gaping fissure which had nothing prejudicial in it to <i>
Aratus Pisonii</i> among the foliage of the mangrove bushes, was
not suitable to the <i>Ocypoda</i> living in sand; that in the
latter, in order to prevent the penetration of the sand, the
orifice of the branchial cavity must be placed at its lowest part,
directed downwards, and concealed between broad surfaces fringed
with protective brushes of hair. It is far from the intention of
these pages to enter upon a general refutation of this theory of
adaptation. Indeed there is scarcely anything essential to be added
to the many admirable remarks that have been made upon this subject
since the time of Spinoza. But this may be remarked, that I regard
it as one of the most important services of the Darwinian theory
that it has deprived those considerations of usefulness which are
still undeniable in the domain of life, of their mystical
supremacy. In the case before us it is sufficient to refer to the
Gelasimus of the mangrove swamps, which shares the same conditions
of life with various Grapsoid&aelig; and yet does not agree with
them, but with the arenicolous <i>Ocypoda.</i></p>

<p class="fnote">
<a name="1."></a>1. As this was not observed in the sea, but in
glass vessels containing sea-water, it might be supposed that the
animals become exhausted and die, not because they are under water
but because they have consumed all the oxygen which it contained. I
therefore put into the same water from which I had just taken an
unconscious <i>Ocypoda,</i> with its legs hanging loosely down, a
specimen of <i>Lupea diacantha</i> which had been reduced to the
same state by being kept in the air, and this recovered in the
water just as the <i>Ocypoda</i> did in the air.<br>
2. This smaller <i>Gelasimus</i> is also remarkable because the
chameleon-like change of colour exhibited by many Crabs occurs very
strikingly in it. The carapace of a male which I have now before me
shone with a dazzling white in its hinder parts five minutes since
when I captured it, at present it shows a dull gray tint at the
same place.</p>
