<h1>THE MOTOR BOYS ON THE PACIFIC</h1>
<h4>or</h4>
<h4>The Young Derelict Hunters</h4>
<h2>by CLARENCE YOUNG</h2>
<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<P ALIGN=Center class=center>
DEAR BOYS:
<P>
I believe it is not necessary to introduce the Motor Boys to most of my readers,
as they have made their acquaintance in the previous books of this series.
To those, however, who take up this volume without having previously read
the ones that go before, I take pleasure in presenting my friends, Jerry,
Ned and Bob.
<P>
They are booked for quite a long trip, this time; across the continent to
the Pacific coast, where they are destined to have some stirring adventures,
searching for a mysterious derelict.
<P>
Those of you who know the Motor Boys from their past performances know that
they will meet emergencies in the right spirit, and that they will do their
level best to accomplish what they set out to do. Whether they did so in
this case I leave it for you to determine by reading the book.
<P>
Though their own motor boat, the <I>Dartaway,</I> was destroyed in a train
wreck, they managed to get the use of a powerful craft, in which they made
a cruise on the Pacific ocean. Their old friend, Professor Snodgrass was
with them, and, if you care to learn of his search for a horned toad, you
will find the details set down here.
<P align=center class=center>
Yours very truly,
<P align=right class=right>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>SOME BAD NEWS</h4>
<P>
"WELL, she is smashed this time, sure!" exclaimed Jerry Hopkins, to his chums,
Ned Slade and Bob Baker.
<P>
"What's smashed?" asked Ned. "Who's the letter from'?" for Jerry had a slip
of paper in his hand.
<P>
"It isn't a letter. It's a telegram."
<P>
"A telegram!" exclaimed Bob. "What's up, Jerry?"
<P>
"She's smashed, I tell you. Busted, wrecked, demolished, destroyed, slivered
to pieces, all gone!"
<P>
"Who?"
<P>
"Our motor boat, the <I>Dartaway!"</I>
<P>
"Not the <I>Dartaway!"</I> and Ned and Bob crowded closer to Jerry.
<P>
"That's what she is. There's no mistake about it this time, I'm afraid. You
know we thought once before she had gone to flinders, but it wasn't so. This
time it is."
<P>
"How did it happen?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Yes, tell us, can't you?" cried Bob. "What are you so slow about?"
<P>
"Say, Chunky," remarked Jerry, looking at his fat chum, "if you'll give me
a chance I'll tell you all I know. I just got this telegram from the Florida
Coast Railway Company. It says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  "'Jerry Hopkins. Motor boat <I>Dartaway, </I> shipped by you from. St. Augustine
  in freight wreck just outside Jacksonville. Boat total loss, buried under
  several freight cars. Will write further particulars. J. H. Maxon, General
  Freight Agent."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"That's all there is to it," added Jerry, folding up the telegram.
<P>
"All there is to it! I guess not much!" exclaimed Bob. "Aren't you going
to sue 'em for damages, Jerry?"
<P>
"Well, there's no use being in such a rush," observed Jerry. "Maybe they'll
pay the claim without a suit. I'll have to make some inquiries."
<P>
"Let's go down to the freight once here and see Mr. Hitter," suggested Ned.
"He can tell us what to do. The poor <I>Dartaway! </I> Smashed!"
<P>
"And in a land wreck, too!" put in Jerry. "It wouldn't be so bad if she had
gone down on the Atlantic, chasing after a whale, or in pursuit of a shark&mdash;"
<P>
"Or with the flag flying, out in a storm, with Salt Water Sam," interrupted
Ned. "But to think of her being buried under a lot of freight cars! It's
tough, that's what it is!"
<P>
"That's right," agreed Bob. "Just think of it! No more rides in her! Say,
we ought to get heavy damages! She was a fine boat!"
<P>
"Come on then," cried Ned. "Don't let's stand here chinning all day. Let's
go see Mr. Hitter. He has charge of all the freight that comes to Cresville,
and he can tell us how to proceed to collect damages."
<P>
"Yes, I guess that's all that's left for us to do," decided Jerry, and the
three lads started for the railroad depot.
<P>
They lived in the town of Cresville, Mass., a thriving community, and had
been chums and inseparable companions ever since they could remember. Bob
Baker was the son of a wealthy banker, while Jerry Hopkins's mother was a
widow, who had been left considerable property, and Ned Slade's father owned
a large department store.
<P>
You boys who have read the previous volumes of this "Motor Boys Series" do
not need to be reminded of the adventures the three chums had together. To
those of you who read this book first, I will say that, in the first volume,
called "The Motor Boys," there was related a series of happenings that followed
the winning of a certain bicycle race in Cresville. After their victory in
this contest the boys got motorcycles, and, by winning a race on them, won
a touring car.
<P>
In this automobile they had many adventures, and several narrow escapes.
They incurred the enmity of Noddy Nixon, a town bully, and his crony, Bill
Berry. The three chums then took a long trip overland in their automobile,
as related in the second book of this series and, incidentally, managed to
locate a rich mine belonging to a prospector, who, to reward them, gave them
a number of shares. While out west the boys met a very learned gentleman,
Professor Uriah Snodgrass, who was traveling in the interests of science.
He persuaded the boys to go with him in their automobile to search for a
certain ancient, buried city, and this they found in Mexico, where they had
a number of surprising adventures.
<P>
Returning from that journey, they made a trip across the plains, on which
they discovered the hermit of Lost Lake. Arriving home they decided, some
time later, to get a motor boat, and, in the fifth volume of the series,
entitled, "The Motor Boys Afloat," there was set down what happened to them
on their first cruise on the river, during which they solved a robbery mystery.
Finding they were well able to manage the boat they took a trip on the Atlantic
ocean, and, after weathering some heavy storms they reached home, only to
start out again on a longer voyage, this time to strange waters amid the
everglades of Florida.
<P>
They had recently returned from that queer region, and, as they had done
on their journey to that locality, they shipped their boat by rail from St.
Augustine to Cresville. Or, rather, they saw it safely boxed at the freight
station in St. Augustine, and came on up north, trusting that the
<I>Dartaway</I> would arrive in due season, and in good condition.
<P>
They had been home a week now, and as there was no news of their boat, Jerry
had become rather anxious and had written to the railroad officials in St.
Augustine. In response he got the telegram which brought consternation to
the hearts of the motor boys.
<P>
"It doesn't seem possible," remarked Bob, as the three lads hurried on toward
the freight office.
<P>
"I guess it's good-bye to the <I>Dartaway</I> this trip," said Jerry. "Too
bad! she was a fine boat."
<P>
"Well, we'll make the railroad pay for it, and we'll get a better boat,"
spoke up Bob.
<P>
"We couldn't get any better boat than the <I>Dartaway, </I> Chunky," said
Ned. "We might get a larger one, and a more powerful one, but never a better
one, She served us well. To think of her being crushed under a lot of freight
cars! It makes me mad!"
<P>
"No use feeling that way," suggested Jerry. "Just think of the good times
we had in her, not only on this last trip, but on the previous cruises."
<P>
"This last was the best," remarked Bob, with something like a sigh. "It was
lovely down there in Florida."
<P>
"I guess he's thinking of the Seabury girls," put in Ned, with a wink at
Jerry.
<P>
"No more than you are!" exclaimed Bob. "I guess you were rather sweet on
Olivia, yourself."
<P>
"Or was it Rose or Nellie?" asked Jerry with a laugh. "They were all three
nice&mdash;very nice."
<P>
"That's right," said Ned, fervently.
<P>
The three young ladies the boys referred to were daughters of a Mr. Nathan
Seabury, whom the boys met while cruising about the everglades and adjacent
rivers and lakes. He was in his houseboat <I>Wanderer, </I> traveling for
his health. Mr. Seabury owned a large hotel in Florida and his meeting with
the boys, especially with Jerry, was a source of profit to Mrs. Hopkins.
<P>
She owned some land in Florida; but did not consider it of any value. It
developed that it adjoined Mr. Seabury's hotel property and, as he wished
it to enlarge his building, he purchased the lot for a goodly sum.
<P>
The three boys, after the return of the <I>Dartaway</I> and <I>Wanderer</I>
from the strange waters, had stopped for a week at Mr. Seabury's hotel, before
journeying north.
<P>
"I'd like to see them again," said Bob, after a pause, during which the boys
turned into the street leading to the depot.
<P>
"Who?" asked Ned.
<P>
"The Seabury family."
<P>
"Mr. Seabury&mdash;or&mdash;er&mdash;the girls?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"All of 'em," replied Bob quickly.
<P>
"I had a letter the other day," remarked Jerry quietly.
<P>
"You did!" exclaimed Ned.
<P>
"From them?" asked Bob eagerly.
<P>
"Well, it wasn't exactly a family letter," answered Jerry, with just the
suspicion of a blush. "It was from Nellie, and she said she, her sisters
and father were going to lower California."
<P>
"To California?" exclaimed Bob and Ned.
<P>
"Yes; for Mr. Seabury's health. You know they said they expected to when
we parted from them. The climate of Florida did not do him any good, and
they are going to try what California will do. She asked us to call and see
them, if we were ever in that neighborhood."
<P>
"I guess our chances of going to California are pretty slim," remarked Bob.
"Our motor boat's gone now, and we can't make any more cruises."
<P>
"I don't see what that's got to do with it," declared Ned. "We couldn't very
well cross the continent in her, even if we had the <I>Dartaway, </I> and
she was rather too small to make the trip by water, even if the Panama Canal
was finished."
<P>
"Oh, well, you know what I mean," retorted Bob, who did not exactly know
himself. "We can't go anywhere right away. School opens soon, and it's buckle
down and study all winter I suppose. But&mdash;"
<P>
Bob's remarks were interrupted by the arrival of the Boston Express, which
rumbled into the Cresville station, where the boys now were and, after a
momentary stop, steamed on again. A man leaped from the steps of a parlor
car and ran into the freight office, first, however, looking up and down
the length of the train to see if any other passengers got off.
<P>
"He seems in a hurry," observed Ned.
<P>
"Yes, and he must have some pull with the railroad, for the Boston Express
never stops here," said Jerry. "Maybe he's the president of the road."
<P>
The boys kept on to the freight office. When they reached it they found the
stranger in conversation with Mr. Hitter, the agent. The chums could not
help overhearing the talk.
<P>
"Have you several packages here, addressed to X. Y. Z., to he held until
called for?" the stranger asked.
<P>
"There they be," replied the agent, pointing to several small boxes, piled
near the door.
<P>
"That's good," and the man seemed much relieved. "Now I want them shipped
by fast freight to San Francisco, and I want to prepay them so there will
be no delay. How much is it?" and he pulled out a pocketbook, disclosing
a roll of bills. As he did so he hurried to the door and looked up and down
the depot platform, as if afraid of being observed. He saw the three boys,
and, for a moment, seemed as if he was about to hurry away. Then, with an
obvious effort, he remained, but turned into the freight office and shut
the door.
<P>
"He acts as if he was afraid we would steal something from him," said Bob.
<P>
"Or as if he didn't want us to hear any more about those boxes," supplemented
Jerry. "He's a queer customer, he is."
<P>
"Well, it's none of our affair," remarked Ned, but neither he nor his chums
realized how, a little later, they were to take part in an adventure in which
the mysterious man and the queer boxes were to figure importantly.
<P>
In a short time the man came out of the freight office. He did not look at
the boys, but hurried off down the street, putting some papers into his pocket
book, which, the boys could not help noticing as he passed them, was not
so full of money as it had been.
<P>
"Let's go in and ask Mr. Hitter what to do about our boat," suggested Ned.
<P>
They found the agent counting over a roll of bills.
<P>
"Been robbing a bank?" asked Bob cheerfully. "Guess I'd better tell dad to
look out for his money."
<P>
"That was paid by the man who was just in in here," replied the agent. "Queer
chap. Seemed as if he didn't want to be found out. First he was going to
ship his stuff by fast freight, and then he concluded it would be better
by express, though it cost a lot more. But he had plenty of money."
<P>
"Who was he?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"That's another funny part of it. He didn't tell me his name, though I hinted
I'd have to have it to give him a receipt. He said to make it out X. Y. Z.,
and I done it. That's the way them boxes come, several days ago, from Boston.
They arrived by express, consigned to X. Y. Z., and was to be called for.
I thought of everybody in town, but there ain't nobody with them initials.
I was just wondering what to do with 'em when in be comes an' claims 'em."
<P>
"What's in em?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"Blessed if I know," responded Mr. Hitter. "I couldn't git that out of him,
either, though I hinted that I ought to know if it was dynamite, or anything
dangerous."
<P>
"What did he say?" inquired Ned.
<P>
"He said it wasn't dynamite, but that's all he would say, an' I didn't have
no right to open 'em. He paid me the expressage, and seemed quite anxious
to know just when I could ship the boxes, and when they'd arrive in San
Francisco. I could tell him the first, but not the last, for there's no tellin'
what delays there'll be on the road.
<P>
"He was a queer man&mdash;a very queer man. I couldn't make him out. An' he went
off in a hurry, as if he was afraid some one would see him. An' he shut the
door, jest as if you boys would bother him,&mdash;Well, it takes all sorts of
people to make a world. I don't s'pose you or I will ever meet him again."
<P>
Mr. Hitter was not destined to, but the boys had not seen the last of the
strangely acting man, who soon afterward played a strange part in their lives.
<P>
"What you chaps after, anyhow?" went on the freight agent, when he had put
the money in the safe.
<P>
"Our motor boat's smashed!" exclaimed Bob. "We want damages for her! How
are we going to get 'em?"
<P>
"Not guilty, boys!" exclaimed the agent holding up his hands, as if he thought
wild-west robbers were confronting him. "You can search me. Nary a boat have
I got, an' you can turn my pockets inside out!" and he turned slowly around,
like an exhibition figure in a store show window.
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4>A DESPERATE RACE</h4>
<P>
"WELL," remarked Mr. Hitter, after a pause, during which the boys, rather
surprised at his conduct, stood staring at him, "well, why don't you look
in my hip pocket. Maybe I've got a boat concealed there."
<P>
"I didn't mean to go at you with such a rush," apologized Jerry. "But you
see&mdash;"
<P>
"That's all right," interrupted the freight agent. "Can I put my hands down
now? The blood's all runnin' out of 'em, an' they feel as if they was goin'
to sleep. That'll never do, as I've got a lot of way-bills to make out,"
and he lowered his arms.
<P>
"Do you know anything about this?" asked Jerry, handing Mr. Hitter the telegram.
<P>
"What's that? The <I>Dartaway</I> smashed!" the agent exclaimed, reading
the message. "Come now, that's too bad! How did it happen?"
<P>
The boys explained how they had shipped the craft north.
<P>
"Of course the accident didn't happen on the line of railroad I am agent
for," said Mr. Hitter, after reading the telegram again. "If it had, we'd
be responsible."
<P>
"What can we do?" asked Bob. "We want to get damages."
<P>
"An' I guess you're entitled to 'em," replied the agent. "Come on inside,
and I'll tell you what to do. You'll have to make a claim, submit affidavits,
go before a notary public and a whole lot of rig-ma-role, but I guess, in
the end you'll get damages. They can't blame you because the boat was smashed.
It's too bad! I feel like I'd lost an old friend."
<P>
Mr. Hitter had had several rides in the <I>Dartaway</I> for he had done the
boys many favors and they wished to return them, so he was given a chance
to get intimately acquainted with the speedy craft.
<P>
Taking the boys into his office, Mr. Hitter instructed them how to write
a letter to the claim department of the Florida Coast Railway, demanding
damages for the smashing of the boat.
<P>
"Be respectful, but put it good and strong," he said. "I'll write on my own
account to the general freight agent. He's a friend of mine, and we have
business dealings together&mdash;that is his road and my road," and Mr. Hitter
spoke as though he owned the line of which he was the Cresville agent.
<P>
"That'll be good," said Bob. "Maybe it will hurry matters up. We're much
obliged to you, Mr. Hitter."
<P>
"That's what we are," chimed in Jerry and Ned.
<P>
The boys lost no time in sending in their claim. Then there was nothing to
do but to wait. They knew it would take some days, and they did not expect
an answer in less than a week, while Mr. Hitter told them that if they got
money in payment for the destroyed boat within three months they would be
lucky.
<P>
"Well, since the <I>Dartaway's</I> gone, I guess we'll have to go back to
the automobile for a change," suggested Jerry one afternoon, early in September,
about a week before school was to open. "Let's take a little jaunt out in
the country, stay a couple of days, and come back, all ready to pitch in
and study."
<P>
"Fine!" cried Bob. "We'll stay at a hotel where they have good dinners&mdash;"
<P>
"Of course!" retorted Ned. "That's Chunky's first idea&mdash;something to eat.
I've been waiting for him to say something like that."
<P>
The boys were at Jerry's house, talking over various matters. The auto was
kept in an unused barn back of his home, but, since the advent of the motor
boat, had not seen much service, though occasionally the boys went out in
it. Now, it was likely to come into active use again.
<P>
"Let's look the machine over," proposed Jerry. "It may need some repairs.
It got pretty hard usage, especially in our trips to Mexico and across the
plains."
<P>
The boys soon found that, beyond two tires which needed repairs, and some
minor adjustments to the engine, the car was in good shape. It was in running
order and, at Bob's suggestion, they got in it and made a trip to the town
garage, where they intended to leave it to be overhauled.
<P>
As they were turning a corner, near the automobile shop, they heard a sudden
"Honk-honk!" that startled them. Jerry, who was at the steering wheel, shut
off the power and applied the emergency brake.
<P>
And it was only just in time for, a moment later, from a cross street, there
shot out a big green touring car, very powerful, as they could tell by the
throbbing of the engine. It almost grazed the mudguards of the machine in
which the three boys were, and, skidded dangerously. Then, with what seemed
an impudent, warning toot of the horn, it swung around and sped off down
the road.
<P>
"That was a close shave!" remarked Jerry, as he released the brake.
<P>
"I should say yes," agreed Bob. "That was a six-cylinder car. Bur-r-r-r!
If she'd hit us&mdash;" He did not finish, but the boys knew what he meant.
<P>
They proceeded to the garage, leaving their machine to be repaired. It would
be ready for them the next day, the man said, and they arranged to call for
it, and go for a trip in the country.
<P>
"Let's go to Riverton," suggested Bob, naming a summer resort about a hundred
miles away. "The season is just about to close there, and, as it isn't crowded,
we can get better attention and&mdash;"
<P>
"Better meals, he means," finished Ned. "All right, Chunky, we'll go."
<P>
"It wouldn't be a bad idea," agreed Jerry. "We could make it in one day easily,
and wouldn't have to hurry. We could stay there a couple of days, making
little side strips, and come back Saturday. That would put us in good shape
for Monday, when school opens."
<P>
There was no dissension from this plan, and, having secured the consent of
their parents, the boys, early the next day, started off on their journey.
It was a short one, compared to those they had been in the habit of taking,
but they did not have time for a longer jaunt.
<P>
They arrived at Riverton in the afternoon, having stopped on the road for
dinner. They found the place rather livelier than they expected, for there
had been an automobile meet the day previous, including a big race, and several
lovers of the sport still remained, for the weather was very pleasant. The
sheds about the hotel were filled with all sorts of cars, so that the boys
had hardly room to store their machine.
<P>
"This is a little more exciting than we counted on," remarked Jerry, as he
and his chums entered the hotel to register. "I'm afraid we'll not get such
good attention as Bob thought."
<P>
"Oh, it's all the better," was the answer of the stout youth. "They'll have
all the more to eat, with this crowd here."
<P>
"Chunky can argue it any way he likes," declared Ned. "No use trying to corner
him, Jerry."
<P>
"No, I guess not. But I'm hungry enough to eat almost anything."
<P>
As they were turning away from the clerk's desk, having been assigned to
rooms, the boys saw a youth, about their own age, standing near a bulletin
board fastened on the side wall. The youth was tacking up a notice and, as
he turned, having finished, Jerry exclaimed in a whisper:
<P>
"Noddy Nixon! What's he doing here?"
<P>
At the same moment, Noddy, the long-time enemy of the motor boys, saw them.
His face got red, and he swung quickly aside to avoid speaking to the three
chums.
<P>
The last they had seen of the bully was when he started to accompany them
back to Cresville, after his disastrous attempt to make money from a Florida
cocoanut grove. Noddy was wanted as a witness by the government authorities,
in connection with the attempted wreck of a vessel, in which Bill Berry was
concerned; but, after the motor boys had rescued Noddy from an unpleasant
position in Florida, and he had agreed to return to Cresville, he suddenly
disappeared in the night. This was the first they had seen of him since.
They had learned that the government no longer desired his testimony.
<P>
"Let's see what notice he put up," suggested Ned. "Maybe he has lost something."
<P>
They walked over to the bulletin board. There, in Noddy's rather poor
handwriting, was a challenge. It was to the effect that he would race, on
the track near the hotel, any automobilist who would choose to compete with
him, for money, up to five hundred dollars, or merely for fun.
<P>
"Noddy must have a new car," remarked Ned. "His old one couldn't go for a
cent. We beat it several times."
<P>
"What's the matter with trying again?" asked Jerry, a light of excitement
coming into his eyes. "I'd like to have a race. Maybe several cars will enter,
and we can have some fun out of it. Our machine has a lot of 'go' left in
it yet."
<P>
"That's the stuff!" exclaimed Bob. "I'm with you. But let's get supper first,
maybe&mdash;"
<P>
"I guess he's afraid there won't be any left," remarked Jerry. "But come
on, I can eat a bit myself."
<P>
As the boys left the office of the hotel, they saw several men reading the
notice Noddy had tacked up.
<P>
"A race on this circular track here!" exclaimed one man to a friend as the
boys passed him. "It's very risky! The turns are not banked enough. I wouldn't
do it, but I suppose some will take the chance."
<P>
"Yes, it will be a dangerous race," responded the other. "Who is this Noddy
Nixon?"
<P>
"A son of that rich Nixon over in Cresville, I believe. His father made a
lot of money in stocks lately, and, I guess the son is helping spend it.
He has a powerful car."
<P>
The motor boys did not stay to hear more, but went to their rooms to change
their clothes, and were soon eating supper. There was talk of nothing but
automobile topics in the hotel corridors and office that evening. Many motorists
were planning to leave the next day, but some said they would stay and see
if the Nixon race would amount to anything.
<P>
"Let's accept the challenge," suggested Jerry.
<P>
"I don't want to have anything to do with Noddy," objected Ned.
<P>
"We don't have to," replied Bob, "I was talking to the clerk about it. All
we have to do is register our names, and the name of the car. It's an informal
affair, only for fun. They won't race for money. Come on, let's go in it."
<P>
Hearing this, Ned agreed, and the boys put their names down. As Noddy had
stipulated there must be four passengers in each car it would necessitate
the motor boys getting some one else to ride with them. This the clerk agreed
to arrange.
<P>
There were six entries in the race, which was to take place the next day.
Early in the morning, before breakfast, Ned, Jerry and Bob went out in their
car to try the course. When they were half way around it they heard a car
coming behind them. In a moment it had passed them, and they recognized it
as the same machine that had nearly collided with them in Cresville.
<P>
"Look who's in it!" cried Bob.
<P>
"Who?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Noddy Nixon. If that's his car, we haven't any show."
<P>
"Humph! I'm afraid not," answered Jerry rather ruefully. "Still, I'm not
going to give up now. He's got a new car, but maybe we can beat him. He's
a poor driver."
<P>
Several other autos soon appeared on the track to have a "tryout," and, though
none of them seemed as speedy as Noddy's new machine, there was no talk of
dropping out on the part of those who had entered. That gave the boys more
courage, and they decided to stick, even though their chances were not good.
<P>
Noddy did not speak to them, though he passed them several times. Nor did
he appear very popular with the other autoists. He had several young men
with him, and they made things rather lively about the hotel, occasionally
giving what seemed to be college yells.
<P>
"They're regular 'rah-rah' boys," said Bob, in contempt.
<P>
Early that afternoon just before the race Bob, Jerry and Ned spent an hour
in going over their car, making some adjustments, and seeing that the tires
were in good shape. Almost at the last minute Jerry decided to put the
non-skidding chains on the rear wheels.
<P>
"Those turns, which are not banked much, are dangerous," he said, "I'm not
going to take any chances. We don't want to turn turtle."
<P>
There was much activity about the hotel as the hour for the contest arrived.
Noddy's car seemed the finest of the six that lined up at the starting tape.
The motor boys had drawn a position next to the bully and his cronies.
<P>
Noddy glanced contemptuously at them.
<P>
"You must think it's winter, putting chains on," he remarked to Jerry, who
had been chosen to steer.
<P>
"It may be a cold day for somebody before we get through," was all Jerry
replied.
<P>
"You haven't the ghost of a show," called one of Noddy's companions. "You'll
think you're standing still when we start."
<P>
The others laughed at this joke, and Noddy seemed pleased. There was a short
consultation among the judges and other officials, and, a moment later, a
white puff of smoke was seen hovering above the uplifted revolver of the
starter. Then came a sharp crack, and the panting machines, the engines of
which had been put in motion some time previous, started off together, as
the drivers threw in the high speed gears.
<P>
The race, which was truly a dangerous contest, was on, and, with eager eyes
the motor boys looked ahead on the course.
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4>NEWS FROM THE WEST</h4>
<P>
THE track was a half-mile one, and, as the length of the race was five miles
it would be necessary to make ten laps or circuits. The course was in the
shape of an ellipse, with rather sharp turns at either end, where the
contestants, if they did not want a spill, or a bad skid, must slacken their
pace. It was on the two straight stretches that speed could be made.
<P>
At the report of the pistol Noddy's car shot off as an arrow from a bow,
the explosions of the cylinders sounding like a small battery of quick-firing
guns in action. But the others were after him, the five cars bunched together,
that of the motor boys a little behind the other four.
<P>
"We've got to catch him, Jerry," whispered Bob.
<P>
"Easier said than done," replied Jerry, as he shoved the gasolene lever over
a trifle, and advanced the spark, thereby increasing the speed of the car.
"Noddy's got a powerful machine."
<P>
"They should have had a handicap on this race," said Tom Jennings, the young
man whom the hotel clerk had asked to be a fourth passenger in the motor
boys' car, so that the conditions of the contest would be met. "It's not
fair to have a high power auto race one of two cylinders."
<P>
"Ours has four," spoke Ned. "Of course its not as up-to-date as Noddy's is,
but&mdash;"
<P>
"We'll beat him!" exclaimed Bob. "We've done it before and we can do it again."
<P>
"I'm afraid not," went on Tom. "That big green car of his will go ahead of
anything on this track."
<P>
And so it seemed, for Noddy was spinning around the course at fearful speed,
his car looking like a green streak.
<P>
"Let's see how he takes the turn," suggested Bob. "He'll have to slow up
if he doesn't want a spill."
<P>
Noddy was wise enough to do this, though even at the reduced speed at which
he went around the bank, his rear wheels skidded rather alarmingly.
<P>
But Jerry was not idle during this time. As he found his car responding to
the increase of gasolene and the advanced spark, he shoved the levers still
further over. The auto shot forward, distancing the yellow car immediately
in front of it, passing one with an aluminum body and closely approaching
a purple auto which was behind Noddy.
<P>
Suddenly a loud explosion sounded back of the motor boys.
<P>
"There goes a tire!" exclaimed Bob.
<P>
"Hope it isn't one of yours," said Tom.
<P>
"If it was you'd be sliding along the track on your face instead of sitting
here," responded Bob. "No, it's one on the aluminum car. She's out of the
race," he added as he gave a quick glance back. A few minutes later there
was another noise&mdash;a crashing sound&mdash;and the motor boys, by a quick glance,
saw that the rearmost car in the race had, by injudicious steering, been
sent through a frail fence which surrounded the track. The radiator was broken
and, though no one was hurt the car was put out of business. That left but
four cars&mdash;Noddy's green one, the yellow, the red one of the motor boys',
and a purple affair. They were speeding along in that order, and, a few seconds
later something went wrong with one of the cylinders of the purple machine,
leaving but three contestants. Then the yellow car shot ahead of the red
one containing the motor boys.
<P>
By this time one circuit of the track had been completed, and a start made
on the second lap.
<P>
"Think we're catching up?" asked Bob, as Jerry cautiously fed the engine
a little more gasolene.
<P>
"Well, we're holding our own," was the answer of the steersman, "and I think
we're catching up to the yellow car again. If we pass that I'm not so sure
but what we can come in a close second to Noddy."
<P>
"I don't want to come in second," spoke up Ned. "I want to beat him."
<P>
"So do I," replied Jerry, "but it's not going to be so easy. Our car's doing
well, but we can't expect wonders of it."
<P>
"The race isn't over until you're at the finish tape," said Tom Jennings.
"Keep on, boys, I'd like to see that Nixon chap beaten. He thinks he owns
the earth."
<P>
For two miles there was no change in the position of the cars. Then slowly,
very slowly, Jerry saw that his red machine was overtaking the yellow car.
Inch by inch it crept up, the steersman of the rival car doing his best but
failing to get more speed out of the engine.
<P>
"Too bad we have to pass you!" cried Jerry, as he careened past the yellow
machine.
<P>
"That's all right," sung out the steersman good-naturedly. "Beat that other
one, if you can."
<P>
"We're going to try!" yelled Ned, above the noise of the exploding cylinders.
<P>
They were on a straight stretch then and, as Noddy looked back and saw the
red car closer to him than it had been before, he put on more speed. His
green auto shot forward but Jerry still had something in reserve, and he
let his machine out another notch.
<P>
"He's got to slow up for the turn!" cried Ned. "Maybe we can pass him!"
<P>
"Yes, but we've got to slacken up too, if we don't want a spill," replied
Bob.
<P>
"That's so," admitted Ned.
<P>
Noddy did slow up, but not much, and his car skidded worse than at any time
yet. It looked as if it was going over, and a cry from the spectators showed
that they, too, anticipated this disaster. But, with a sharp wrench of the
steering wheel, Noddy brought the car back toward the center of the track.
<P>
Jerry swung around the turn at reduced speed, and, because of the chains,
his machine did not skid more than a few inches.
<P>
"Good thing you have those chains on," commented Tom. "They may come in handy
at the finish."
<P>
"That's what I put them there for," answered Jerry.
<P>
For another mile there was little change in the relative position of the
cars of Noddy and the motor boys. Jerry thought he had cut the bully's lead
somewhat, but he still felt that he was far from having a good chance to
win the race. Still, he was not going to give up.
<P>
"Two laps more and it's all over," said Bob, as they began on the final mile.
"Can't you hit it up a bit more, Jerry?"
<P>
"I'll try."
<P>
Just a degree faster came the explosions of the cylinders of the red car.
But also, still faster, came the reports from Noddy's auto. He was not going
to be beaten if he could help it.
<P>
Around the two machines swung, the yellow car having given up and dropped
out. There was a confused shouting from the spectators, and Bob could distinguish
cheers for the red auto.
<P>
"We've just got to win!" he cried. "Win, Jerry! Win!"
<P>
Try as he did, by "nursing" the engine, Jerry could not gain an inch on Noddy's
car. The red machine was fifty feet behind the green one, both going at top
speed. Only an accident, it seemed, could make the motor boys win.
<P>
As they swung into the last lap Ned cried:
<P>
"Noddy isn't going to slow down for the turn!"
<P>
"Neither are we!" cried Jerry fiercely. "Quick boys! All of you get out on
the inside step! Crouch down! That will help hold us as we go around the
bank, or, otherwise, we'll go over."
<P>
They all knew what he meant. By hanging out on the runboard or step, nearest
the inside of the track, more weight would be added to that side of the car.
It was what automobilists call "shifting the center of gravity," and aids
in preventing spills.
<P>
Giving one glance to see that the boys were in their places, Jerry grasped
the steering wheel firmly, and sent the car at the dangerous turn at full
speed. Noddy was doing the same, but he had not thought of having any of
his passengers hang out on the step.
<P>
"Look out now, boys!" called Jerry, as they took the turn.
<P>
"Swing out as far as you can, boys, but hang down low!" called Tom Jennings,
who had been in races before.
<P>
Even with this precaution, and aided as they were by the chains on the rear
wheels, the red car skidded or slewed so that Jerry thought it was going
over. But it did not. By the narrowest margin it kept on the bank.
<P>
Not so, however, with Noddy's green dragon. As soon as his car struck the
turn it began to skid. He would not shut off his power, but kept on the high
gear, and with the engine going at top speed.
<P>
There was a cry of alarm, and then the green car left the track, mounted
the bank, slid over the top, and came to a halt in a pool of mud and water
on the other side of the field. It went fifty yards before Noddy could stop
it.
<P>
"Go on! Go on!" yelled Ned. "We win! We win!"
<P>
Jerry had all he could do to hold the steering wheel of his slewing car,
but, by gripping it desperately, he swung it into place, and the red machine
started up the home stretch, crossing the tape a winner, for it was the only
car left on the track.
<P>
A burst of cheers greeted it, and men crowded up to shake hands with the
plucky boys.
<P>
"Glad you beat the 'mud lark,'" said the owner of the yellow machine, thus
giving Noddy's car a name that stuck to it for some time. "That Nixon chap
thought he was going to walk over every one. You taught him a much-needed
lesson."
<P>
Nothing was talked of in the hotel that night but the race, and the motor
boys were the heroes of the occasion. Noddy did not appear, and it was learned
that he had to hire men and teams to get his car out of the mud.
<P>
The motor boys started for home the next day, and thought they were going
to make it in good time, but they had a tire accident on the road, when about
twenty-five miles away, and decided to stay in the nearest village over night,
as they had no spare shoe for the wheel.
<P>
As they left their car by the roadside, and tramped into the town, to send
word to the nearest garage, they saw a cloud of dust approaching.
<P>
"Here comes a car," said Bob. "Maybe we can get help."
<P>
As the machine drew nearer they saw that it was painted green, and, a moment
later, Noddy Nixon had brought his auto to a stop, and was grinning at them.
<P>
"Had a break-down, eh?" he asked. "That's a fine car you have, ain't it?"
<P>
"We can beat you!" exclaimed Ned.
<P>
"Yes you can! Not in a thousand years if I hadn't gone off the track! Want
any help? Well, you'll not get it, see? Bye-bye! I'll tell 'em you're coming,"
and, with an ugly leer, the bully started off.
<P>
"I wouldn't take help from him if I had to walk ten miles without my supper,"
said Bob firmly, and that was a strong saying for the stout youth.
<P>
The motor boys found a good hotel in the village, and the next day, when
their car had been repaired, they resumed their journey, arriving at home
about noon.
<P>
"There's some mail for you, Jerry," said Mrs. Hopkins, as her son came in,
after putting the auto in the barn. "It's from California. I didn't know
you knew any one out there."
<P>
"Neither did I, mother. We'll see who it's from."
<P>
He tore open the letter, read it hurriedly, and gave a cry of mingled delight
and surprise.
<P>
"It's from Nellie Seabury!" he said. "She says they are in lower California,
traveling about, looking for a good place to stay at for a few months for
their father's health. When they locate she wants&mdash;that is Mr. Seabury&mdash;wants
us to come out and see them. Oh, I wish I could go&mdash;I wish we could all
go!"
<P>
"Perhaps you can," suggested his mother with a smile. "California is not
so far away. But I suppose you'll have to wait until next vacation."
<P>
"Yes, I suppose so," admitted Jerry. "And that's a long ways off&mdash;a long
ways."
<P>
"The time will soon pass," said his mother. "But tell me about your auto
trip. Did you have a good time?"
<P>
"Fine, and we beat Noddy Nixon in a great race."
<P>
"I wish you wouldn't have anything to do with that young man," said Mrs.
Hopkins. "You have nothing but trouble when you do."
<P>
"I guess he'll not want much more to do with us," returned Jerry. "We manage
to beat him every time. But I must go find the boys. This will be great news
for them&mdash;this letter from the Seabury family."
<P>
"I thought it was from&mdash;Nelly."
<P>
"So it is&mdash;but it's all the same," answered Jerry with a blush.
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4>MORE LETTERS</h4>
<P>
JERRY found Ned, his nearest chum, at home, and told him of the news from
the west.
<P>
"That's fine!" cried Ned. "Come on and tell Bob."
<P>
"Don't have to," said Jerry. "Here he comes now."
<P>
The stout youth was, at that moment, walking along the street toward Ned's
house.
<P>
"Come on in!" cried Ned, as he opened the door while his chum was still on
the steps.
<P>
"That's what I was going to do," responded Chunky. "Did you think I was going
to sit out here? Of course I'm coming in. What's the matter?" for he saw
by Ned's face that something unusual had occurred.
<P>
"Jerry's got a letter from Nellie Seabury&mdash;they're in lower California&mdash;we're
going&mdash;I mean they want us to come and pay them a visit&mdash;I mean&mdash;"
<P>
"Say, for mercy sakes stop!" cried Bob, holding both hands over his ears.
<P>
"I guess Ned's a little excited," suggested Jerry.
<P>
"You guess so&mdash;well, I know so," responded Bob. "Are you all done?" and he
cautiously removed his hands from his ears.
<P>
"Tell him about it, Jerry," said Ned, and Jerry told the news.
<P>
"It would be fine to go out there," said Bob, reflectively. "But there's
school. We can't get out of that."
<P>
They all agreed they could not, and decided the only thing to do was to wait
until the following summer.
<P>
"Too bad," remarked Bob with a sigh. "Winter is the best time of the year
out there, too."
<P>
In spite of the fact that they knew, under the present circumstances, they
could not go for several months, the boys spent an hour or more discussing
what they would do if they could go to California.
<P>
"Oh, what's the use!" exclaimed Ned, when Jerry had spoken of how fine it
would be to hire a motor boat and cruise along the Pacific coast. "Don't
get us all worked up that way, Jerry. Have some regard for our feelings!"
<P>
"Well, let's talk about school. It opens Monday."
<P>
"Don't mention it!" cried Ned. "I say&mdash;hello, there's the postman's whistle.
He's coming here."
<P>
He went to the door, and returned carrying a letter, the envelope of which
he was closely examining.
<P>
"You can find out from who it is by opening it," suggested Jerry.
<P>
"Here's a funny thing," spoke Ned. "This letter is addressed to my father,
but, down in one corner it says, 'May be opened by Ned, in case of necessity.'"
<P>
"Well, then, open it," suggested Bob. "This is a case of necessity. Where's
it from?"
<P>
"Boston, but I don't recognize the writing."
<P>
"Open it," called Jerry.
<P>
Ned did so, and, as he read, he uttered a cry of astonishment.
<P>
"Well if this isn't a queer thing," he said. "Did you ever see such a
coincidence? This letter is from Professor Uriah Snodgrass, and listen to
what he says: 'Dear Mr. Slade, or Ned. I write thus as I want one of you
to read it in a hurry, and one of you may be away from home. You remember
the last I saw of you and your chums (this part is for Ned) was in Florida.
There I secured the rare butterfly I was looking for, and, through that success
I was able to obtain a position with a Boston museum, to travel all over
the world for them, collecting valuable specimens. I have been here for only
a few weeks, but I already have a commission. I am soon to start for California,
in search of a Cornu batrachian.'"
<P>
"A 'Cornu batrachian'!" exclaimed Bob. "For the love of tripe, what's that?"
<P>
"California!" murmured Jerry. "I guess the fates want to pile it up on us."
<P>
"Say, is that 'Cornu batrachian' anything like a mountain lion?" asked Bob.
<P>
"Wait," counseled Ned. "He explains. 'The Cornu batrachian,' he says, 'is
what is commonly called a horned toad. I must get several fine specimens,
and I thought you boys might be making another trip, and could go with me.
I would be very glad of your company. Please let me hear from you. My regards
to Mrs. Slade.'"
<P>
"Well, wouldn't that tickle your teeth!" exclaimed Bob, more forcibly than
elegantly. "And we can't go!" he added with a groan.
<P>
"Think of the fun we'll miss by not being with Professor Snodgrass," went
on Ned.
<P>
"And with the Seabury family," chimed in Jerry.
<P>
"It's tough!" exclaimed Ned. "And school opens Monday!"
<P>
At that moment there was a whistle out in the street and a ring at the door
bell.
<P>
"The postman again," said Ned. "I wonder what he wants?"
<P>
He went to the door.
<P>
"Here's a letter I forgot to give you," said the mailcarrier. "It got out
of place in my bundle, and I didn't discover it until I was quite a way up
the street."
<P>
"That's all right," answered Ned good-naturedly. "From the Board of Education,"
he murmured, as he looked at the printing in the upper left hand corner.
"I wonder what they are writing to me about?"
<P>
He opened it and drew out a printed circular. As he re-entered the room where
his chums were he gave a cry of delight.
<P>
"Listen to this!" he called, and he read:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  "'To the pupils of the Cresville Academy. It has been discovered, at the
  last moment, that a new heating boiler will be needed in the school. The
  tubes of the old one are broken. It has been decided to replace it at once,
  and, as it will be necessary to do considerable work about the building,
  thereby interfering with the proper conducting of studies, the school will
  not open for another month, or six weeks, depending on the length of time
  required to install a new boiler.
  <P>
  "'Therefore pupils will kindly not report on Monday morning, as originally
  intended, but will hold themselves in readiness to begin their school work
  shortly after the receipt of another circular, which will be sent out as
  soon as the building is in proper shape. The faculty earnestly recommends
  that all pupils apply themselves diligently to their studies during this
  unlooked-for, unfortunate, but wholly necessary lengthening of the vacation
  season. By applying to their respective teachers pupils will learn what studies
  to continue.'"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"Whoop!" yelled Bob.
<P>
"O-la-la!" cried Ned after the fashion of some Eastern dervish.
<P>
"Say! That's great!" exclaimed Jerry. "A month more of vacation!"
<P>
"Now we can go to California with Professor Snodgrass, and help him catch
horned toads!" added Ned.
<P>
"And visit the Seabury family," supplemented Jerry. "Oh, boys, this is simply
immense! Things are coming our way after all!"
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4>PROFESSOR URIAH SNODGRASS</h4>
<P>
THE sudden and unexpected news that they need not begin their school studies
on Monday morning fairly startled the boys, at first. They read the circular
over again, to make sure they were not mistaken.
<P>
"Why didn't I get one?" asked Bob, rather suspiciously.
<P>
"Probably it's at your home now," suggested Ned.
<P>
"And I ought to have one, too," said Jerry.
<P>
"You came away before the letter carrier arrived," went on Ned. "Maybe you'd
better go see. It might&mdash;it might be a mistake&mdash;or a joke."
<P>
"Don't say that!" exclaimed Bob. "I'm going to see if I have a letter like
yours."
<P>
"So am I," decided Jerry. "It might, as you say, Ned, be a joke, though it
looks genuine."
<P>
To make sure, Jerry and Bob hurried to their homes. There they found awaiting
them circulars, similar to the one Ned had. To further convince them, as
Jerry and Bob were returning to Ned's house, they met Andy Rush, a small
chap, but as full of life as an electric battery.
<P>
"Hello!" he exclaimed&mdash;"Great news&mdash;no school&mdash;boiler busted&mdash;thousands
of teachers killed&mdash;great calamity&mdash;fine&mdash;horrible&mdash;terrible&mdash;don't have
to study&mdash;longer vacation&mdash;steam pipes blown out&mdash;clouds of steam&mdash;no
heat&mdash;freeze up&mdash;burn to death&mdash;great&mdash;Whoope-e-e!"
<P>
"Did you ever take anything for that?" asked Jerry calmly, when Andy had
finished.
<P>
"Dasn't! if I did I'd blow up! But say&mdash;it's great, isn't it? Did you get
a circular too?" and Andy showed one. "It's fearful&mdash;terrible&mdash;no school&mdash;"
<P>
"Come on," urged Jerry to Bob. "He'll give us nervous prostration if we listen
to him any longer," but they need not have hurried, for Andy, so full of
news that he could not keep still, had rushed off down the street, hopping,
skipping and jumping, to spread the tidings, which nearly every Academy pupil
in Cresville knew by that time.
<P>
Now the motor boys could discuss a Californian trip in earnest, for they
knew their parents would let them go, especially after Mr. Seabury's invitation,
and the letter from Professor Snodgrass. In the course of a few days Jerry
received another missive from Nellie Seabury.
<P>
This letter informed Jerry, and, incidentally, his two chums, that she, with
her sisters and father, had settled in a small town near the coast, not far
from Santa Barbara, and on a little ocean bay, which, Nellie said, was a
much nicer place than any they had visited in Florida.
<P>
"Father likes it very much here," she wrote, "and he declares he feels better
already, though we have been here only a week. He says he knows it would
do him good to see you boys, and he wishes&mdash;in fact we all wish&mdash;you three
chums could come out here for a long visit, though I suppose you cannot on
account of school opening. But, perhaps, we shall see you during the next
vacation."
<P>
"She's going to see us sooner than that," announced Bob, when Jerry had read
the letter to him and Ned.
<P>
"Did you write and tell her we were coming?" asked Ned, his two friends having
called at his house to talk over their prospective trip.
<P>
"No, I thought we'd wait and see what Professor Snodgrass had planned. Perhaps
he isn't going to that part of California."
<P>
"That's so," admitted Bob. "Guess we'll have to wait and find out. I wish
he'd call or write. Have you heard anything more about damages for our smashed
boat, Jerry?"
<P>
"No, I saw Mr. Hitter the other day, and he advised me to wait a while before
writing again. Something queer happened while I was in his office, too."
<P>
"What was it'?"
<P>
"Well, you remember the man who got off the Boston express that day, and
acted so strange about his boxes of stuff he wanted shipped to the Pacific
coast?"
<P>
"Sure," replied Ned and Bob at once.
<P>
"Well, through some mistake one of the boxes was left behind. Mr. Hitter,
had it in his office, intending to ship it back to the man, for it wasn't
worth while to send one box away out west, but it fell and burst partly open.
The box was in one corner of the room, and, while I was there Mr. Hitter's
dog went up to it and began sniffing at it. All at once the dog fell over,
just as if he'd been shot. He stiffened out, and we thought he was dead,
from having eaten something poisoned he found on the floor."
<P>
"Was he?"
<P>
"No, after a while he seemed to come to, and was all right, but he looked
sick. Mr. Hitter said there must be something queer in that box, to make
the dog act that way, and he and I smelled of it, taking care not to get
too close."
<P>
"What was in it?" asked Ned.
<P>
"I don't know. It was something that smelled rather sweet, and somewhat sickish.
Mr. Hitter said it might be some queer kind of poison that acted on animals,
but not on human beings, and he put the box up on a high shelf where his
dog couldn't get at it. But I thought it was rather queer stuff for a man
to be sending away out to the coast."
<P>
"It certainly was," agreed Bob. "That man acted in a strange manner, too,
as if he was afraid some one would see him. I wonder if there is any mystery
connected with him?"
<P>
There came a time when the boys had good reason to remember this incident
of the box filled with a strange substance, for they were in great danger
from it.
<P>
"Well, I don't know that it concerns us," mused Ned. "I guess we'll not get
any damages from the railroad company in time to use the money on our California
trip, so we might as well take some cash out of our saving fund. I do wish
we'd hear from the professor. It's several days since I wrote to him, saying
we would go with him."
<P>
"I suppose he is so busy catching a new kind of flea, or a rare specimen
of mud turtle, that he has forgotten all about writing," suggested Bob. "If
he doesn't&mdash;"
<P>
What Bob intended saying was interrupted by a commotion at the front door.
The bell had rung a few seconds before, and the servant maid had answered
it. Now the boys heard her voice raised in protest:
<P>
"Stop! Stop!" she cried. "Don't do that! You are a crazy man! I'll call the
police!"
<P>
And, in reply came these words:
<P>
"Calm yourself, calm yourself, my dear young lady. All I desire is to capture
that spider crawling on your left arm. It is a very valuable variety of the
red spotted species, and I must have it for my collection. Now just stand
still a moment&mdash;"
<P>
"Professor Snodgrass has arrived!" cried Ned, as he made a rush for the door.
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h4>A STRANGE CONVERSATION</h4>
<P>
WHAT the boys saw made them stop short in amazement, and they had hard work
not to burst into laughter at the sight of the professor, but they knew he
would be offended if they made fun of him.
<P>
Professor Uriah Snodgrass had dropped his valise on the doorstep, and the
impact had caused it to open, thereby liberating a number of toads and lizards
which were crawling about the steps. In his hand the scientist held a large
magnifying glass, through which he was staring at something on the arm of
the servant. She had her sleeves rolled up to her elbows, for she had been
busy sweeping when she answered the door bell.
<P>
"Let me go!" cried the young woman. "You are crazy! I'll call the police!"
<P>
"One moment! One moment!" pleaded the professor eagerly. "I must have that
spider. There!" and with a sudden motion he captured the small insect and
transferred it to a tiny glass box. "I have it! Oh, this is a most fortunate
day for me. The museum will be very glad to get this. It is a perfect specimen,"
and he peered at it through his magnifying glass, as it crawled around, a
captive in the box.
<P>
"Hello, Professor!" greeted Ned. "Glad to see you."
<P>
"Oh, Ned, how are you?" asked the scientist, without glancing up from his
inspection of the spider. "Luck seems to be with me as soon as I arrive at
your house. I have a spider&mdash;"
<P>
"Yes, but you'll not have any of those other specimens long, if you don't
get busy," put in Bob. "They're all hopping or crawling away!"
<P>
"Oh, my goodness!" cried Professor Snodgrass, as he glanced down at the liberated
toads and lizards. "Oh, my goodness! That is too bad. I brought them with
me to compare with the horned toads and web-footed lizards I hope to secure.
Now they are getting away. Please, my dear young lady, help me to save them!"
<P>
But the servant maid had fled into the house as soon as the scientist released
her arm. She was convinced that she had just escaped the clutches of a madman.
<P>
"Come on, boys!" called Ned. "Help the professor!"
<P>
"Here are some small butterfly nets," the scientist said, producing them
from his pocket. "Don't injure the toads or lizards."
<P>
The boys were glad enough of these aids in catching the professor's specimens,
that were rapidly seeking hiding places about the stoop and sidewalk. Though
they had acquired a certain familiarity with strange insects and reptiles,
from seeing the museum collector handle them, they did not fancy picking
up a toad or lizard bare-handed. With the nets, however, they managed, with
the assistance of the scientist, to capture most of the specimens, returning
them to their cases in the valise.
<P>
"There!" exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, when, after a close scrutiny of the porch
he could see no more of the creatures, "I think we have them all. Now boys,
permit me to ask how you are. I am sorry my visit was attended with such
excitement, but I could not miss the chance of getting that spider. That
young woman may consider herself in the light of having advanced science
several degrees. There are very few persons a red spider of that variety
will get on."
<P>
"For which we ought all to be very thankful," announced Jerry. "I beg to
be excused from helping the cause of science in that way. But, Professor,
we're glad to see you. Are you all ready for your trip to California?"
<P>
"I could start to-night," was the answer. "I suppose you have matters all
arranged?"
<P>
"Nearly so," returned Ned. "We thought of starting at the end of this week,"
and he explained how they hoped the destination of the scientist would be
such that they might visit the Seaburys.
<P>
"That locality suits me all right," declared Mr. Snodgrass. "I am not particular
where I go, as long as I can get a specimen of a horned toad, and some web-footed
lizards. I understand there are some to be had in the southern part of
California, and so I will go there. I see no reason why you boys can not
go with me, and also visit your friends. Only I should like to start as soon
as possible. The toads may disappear."
<P>
"Hope not," said Bob, "for your sake. I haven't any use for them, myself."
<P>
"Oh, my dear young friend!" exclaimed the professor. "Some day you will see
the real beauty of a horned toad. It is a most wonderful creature!"
<P>
"I'll take your word for it," murmured Bob. "But now come in and let's see
about our arrangements."
<P>
The professor, who had been invited to be a guest at Ned's house, pending
the start for the west, entered, placing his valise of specimens in a safe
place in the hall. Then he and the boys discussed matters. Mr. Slade came
in, soon after the arrival of the scientist, and announced that he had, in
accordance with a previous arrangement, purchased the boys' tickets.
<P>
"All you've got to do is to pack up and start," said Mr. Slade. "I'm not
going to give you any advice, for you ought to be able to take care of yourselves
by this time. I know you will be safe as long as you are with the professor."
<P>
"Thank you," said the scientist with a bow.
<P>
The professor's arrangements for the western trip were complete and it did
not take the boys long to get ready. By the end of the week the last valise
had been packed, trunks were checked on ahead and, one morning, the boys
started.
<P>
They were to proceed to Los Angeles, and from there were to go down the coast
by land to the small town of San Felicity, where Mr. Seabury and his daughters
had rented a bungalow.
<P>
"Now for a good time!" exclaimed Ned, as the train pulled out of the Cresville
depot. "I've always wanted to visit California, and now I'm going to."
<P>
"We certainly ought to enjoy ourselves," agreed Jerry.
<P>
The travelers made good time to Chicago, little of incident occurring on
the trip. When they got to the Windy City, they found they would have to
wait several hours for a connecting train, and they put in the time seeing
the sights.
<P>
When they returned to the depot they found the professor busy over some
scientific book, sitting as undisturbed in the station, filled as it was
with shifting crowds, as if he was in his quiet study at the museum.
<P>
"The train will be here in about fifteen minutes," he informed the boys.
"Better sit down and wait."
<P>
The three chums were rather tired, and were glad enough to take their places
on the comfortable benches.
<P>
"Chicago is a great place," announced Bob. "That restaurant, where we had
dinner&mdash;"
<P>
"Can't you say something that hasn't got any eating in it?" asked Ned. "You're
the limit, you are."
<P>
"Well," said Bob, "they certainly had fine pie in that place. I wish&mdash;"
<P>
He stopped suddenly, as Jerry help up his hand to indicate silence.
<P>
"What's the matter?" asked Ned in a whisper, as he leaned forward. "See some
new kind of a bug for the professor?"
<P>
"I overheard that man back of us speaking," replied Jerry in a low tone,
nodding his head to indicate where he meant. The benches were arranged so
that travelers occupying them sat back to back. "His voice sounded like one
I've heard before, but I can't place it. I thought maybe you'd remember.
We may have met him on our travels. I can't see his face until he turns around."
<P>
As he finished speaking, the man to whom he referred said something to his
companion beside him. There came a momentary lull in the noises of the depot,
and the boys heard him remark in low, but clear tones:
<P>
"We can make everything look regular. Derelicts are not uncommon, and I think
we'll be able to fool him so that the cargo&mdash;"
<P>
"Hush!" cautioned the other man. "Not so loud!"
<P>
The noise in the station again drowned what the two men were saying, but
the boys had heard enough. All three of them knew at once that the man who
had spoken was the stranger who had acted so queerly in the Cresville freight
office. If they had any doubts of it they were dispelled a moment later when
the doorman called out:
<P>
"All aboard for the western express!"
<P>
As the man and his companion arose, the boys saw he was the same individual
who had been so particular about the boxes of stuff he shipped to San Francisco.
<P>
Before the three chums could make any comment the man and his companion were
lost in the crowd that thronged to the door.
<P>
"Come, boys," said the professor, closing his book. "That's our train."
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h4>A BAD BREAK</h4>
<P>
"THAT was queer, wasn't it?" said Jerry to his chums when they were seated
in the train, moving swiftly toward the great west. "I wonder what he meant,
and what he was doing out here?"
<P>
"And I guess you can keep on wondering, for all the good it will do," commented
Bob. "I couldn't make anything out of what they said, except that some ship
might be lost. That's common enough."
<P>
"I wonder what that stuff was that he shipped from the freight office?" mused
Jerry.
<P>
"Rat poison, maybe," replied Ned with a laugh. "I've heard there are lots
of rats on ships, and maybe he has a patent stuff for getting rid of 'em."
<P>
"It might be," agreed Jerry. "Well, as Bob says, there's no use wondering.
Say, but this is pretty nice scenery," and he pointed to the view from the
window, as they were passing along the shores of a lake.
<P>
"Fine!" exclaimed Ned. "It ought to have some mountains around it, and it
would look just like Lost Lake, where we found the hermit, that time."
<P>
"Seems as if that was a good while ago," commented Bob, "but it wasn't so
very."
<P>
For several hours the boys discussed their past adventures, some of which
were brought to their minds by views of the western country through which
they were passing. Professor Snodgrass took no interest in anything except
a big book which he was studying carefully, at times making notes on slips
of paper, which had a tendency to drop into the aisle, or under the seat
when he was not looking. In consequence the car, in the vicinity of where
the professor sat, looked as though a theatrical snow-storm had taken place.
<P>
One morning the boys awakened to find the train making fast time over a level
stretch of country, with rolling hills here and there, covered with tall
grass. Occasionally glimpses could be had of herds of cattle.
<P>
"We're on the prairies!" exclaimed Bob, as he went to the lavatory to get
ready for breakfast. "Say, now we're in the wild and woolly west, all right."
<P>
"Well, it's not the first time," replied Jerry. "Still it does look good
to see it again. It's a little different, traveling this way, than it was
scooting along in our auto."
<P>
"Yes, and I think I prefer the auto to this," spoke up Ned, yawning and
stretching. "This is too lazy a way of journeying. I'd like to rough it a
bit."
<P>
"Rough it!" exclaimed Bob. "Wait until we get out in California, and we can
sleep out doors, while the folks back home are tending the furnace fire."
<P>
The three boys were just about to enter the lavatory when the train gave
a sudden lurch, and then it began bumping along over the ties, swaying from
side to side. Every window in the car rattled as if it would break, and the
boys were so shaken up, that, to steady themselves, they had to grasp whatever
was nearest.
<P>
"We're off the track!" cried Ned.
<P>
"This&mdash;is&mdash;roughing&mdash;it&mdash;all right!" said Jerry, the words coming out in
jerks. "There's&mdash;been&mdash;an&mdash;accident!"
<P>
"A&mdash;whole&mdash;lot&mdash;of&mdash;'em&mdash;by&mdash;the&mdash;way&mdash;it&mdash;feels to&mdash;me," declared Jerry.
"I&mdash;wonder&mdash;"
<P>
Just then the train came to a stop, the car the boys were in being tilted
at quite an angle.
<P>
"Let's see what happened," suggested Bob, going to the door. His companions
followed him, and, from various berths the passengers began emerging, in
different stages of undress. They looked frightened.
<P>
"Well, at any rate, none of us are killed," said Professor Snodgrass, as
he came down the aisle, fully dressed, for he had arisen early to continue
his reading about horned toads. "What is the matter, boys?"
<P>
"We're just going to find out," said Jerry, as he went down the steps and
walked along the track toward the engine, about which a crowd of passengers
and train men were gathered.
<P>
"What's the trouble?" asked Bob of a brakeman who was running toward the
rear end of the train with a red flag.
<P>
"I don't know exactly. Something wrong with the engine; I guess. I heard
the conductor say it was a bad break."
<P>
"Come on," said Jerry to his chums. "There doesn't seem to be anybody hurt,
but it looks as if we were in for a long wait," and he pointed to several
cars that were off the track, the wheels resting on the wooden ties.
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>HEMMED IN</h4>
<P>
THE boys found a group of worried trainmen gathered about the engine, and
it needed but a glance to show what the trouble was. The piston rod had broken
while the ponderous engine was going at full speed, and the driving rods,
which had broken off from where they were fastened to the wheels, had been
driven deep into the ground. This had served to fairly lift the engine from
the rails, and, in its mad journey it had pulled several cars with it.
<P>
The piston rod, threshing about with nothing to hold it, had broken several
parts of the engine, and some pieces of the driving rods had been hurled
up into the cab, narrowly missing the engineer.
<P>
"It sure is a bad break," said the fireman as he got down from the cab, after
opening the door of the fire box, so that the engine would cool down. "Never
saw a worse."
<P>
"Me either," fairly growled the conductor.
<P>
"Why couldn't it have held off a couple of hours more and we'd been near
some place where we could telegraph for help."
<P>
"You don't mean to say we are away out on the prairies not near a telegraph
station, do you?" asked an excited man.
<P>
"That's just what I do mean to say," replied the conductor. "I've got to
send a brakeman on foot eight miles to wire the news of this accident."
<P>
"You ought to have a telegraph instrument on the train," said the excited
man. "This delay is a bad thing for me. If I don't arrive on time I'll sue
the road. Why don't you have a telegraph instrument on the train?"
<P>
"I don't know," replied the conductor wearily, for he realized he was now
in for a cross-fire of all sorts of questions.
<P>
"How long will we have to wait here?" asked another man.
<P>
"It's hard to say. The brakeman will go as fast as he can, but it will take
some time to get the wrecking crew here with a new engine, and then it will
take some time to get all the cars back on the track."
<P>
"Railroads oughtn't to have such accidents!" declared the excitable man.
"I'll sue 'em, that's what I'll do. What made the piston rod break, conductor?"
<P>
"Oh&mdash;I guess it got tired of going in and out of the cylinder," retorted
the conductor, starting towards the baggage car.
<P>
"Humph! I'll report you for impertinence!" declared the now angry passenger,
taking out his notebook and making a memorandum lest he forget the conductor's
retort. "It's a disgrace the way this road is managed," he went on to the
crowd of passengers that had gathered. "I'm going to write to the newspapers
about it. They're always having accidents. Why, only last week, they run
over a steer, somewhere in this locality, the engine was derailed, two cars
smashed, the road bed torn up, baggage and express stuff scattered all over,
everything upside down, topsy-turvy and&mdash;"
<P>
"Was the steer killed?" asked a little boy, who was listening with opened
mouth and eyes to the story the excited passenger was telling.
<P>
"What!" fairly roared the man, and then, as he saw who had asked the question,
he turned away, and there was a general laugh.
<P>
"Do you think we'll be here long?" asked Bob of the colored porter of the
sleeping car they had occupied.
<P>
"Oh, yes, indeedy!" exclaimed the attendant, "If we gits on de move befo'
night we'll be mighty lucky."
<P>
"Then we've got to stay out here on the prairie all day," exclaimed Jerry.
<P>
"Dat's what," spoke the negro as cheerfully as though that was the regular
program.
<P>
The other passengers were returning to their berths to finish dressing, and
soon the excitement that followed the accident had almost disappeared. Breakfast
was served, and there was nothing to do but to wait for the arrival of the
wrecking crew.
<P>
"What's the matter with taking a stroll across the prairie?" suggested Jerry,
when the boys and the professor had finished their morning meal. "There's
no fun sitting here in the car all day."
<P>
"Good idea!" exclaimed Ned. "I'm with you. Maybe Chunky will be afraid to
come, for fear train robbers will carry off the dining car while he's gone."
<P>
"Oh, you let up!" retorted Bob. "You like to eat as much as I do."
<P>
"Not quite as much, Chunky, but I admit I like my three square meals a day."
<P>
"Where are you going, boys?" asked the professor, looking up from his book,
as he saw the three chums leaving the car.
<P>
"Out for a walk across the prairie," replied Ned.
<P>
"Wait, and I'll go with you. I might get some new specimens. I must never
waste an opportunity," and, placing in his pockets several small boxes to
hold any possible captives he might get in his butterfly net, the scientist
was ready.
<P>
It was pleasant on the vast plain that stretched away in every direction
from the derailed train. The sun was shining brightly, but not too warm,
and there was a gentle breeze.
<P>
"This is fine!" exclaimed Jerry.
<P>
The boys and the professor strolled on for several miles, the three chums
enjoying the walk very much, while Mr. Snodgrass was continually finding
some new insect, or a flower, until his specimen boxes were full.
<P>
"Well, we've come quite a distance," said Ned, as they got on top of a small
hill and looked about. "We can't see the train anywhere. I guess we'd better
be thinking of starting back."
<P>
"Maybe we had," agreed Jerry. "But what's that dark line out there?" and
he pointed to the horizon.
<P>
"A cloud isn't it?" asked Bob.
<P>
"It's too low, and it doesn't move like a cloud," objected Jerry.
<P>
They watched it for some time, as it got larger and larger.
<P>
"Why it's all around us!" suddenly exclaimed Bob.
<P>
And so it was. The travelers were hemmed in by a peculiar, moving ring, that
seemed to get smaller and smaller.
<P>
"What do you think it is, Professor?" asked Ned.
<P>
"That? Why&mdash;er that is&mdash;um&mdash;curious, I can't just say what it is," replied
Mr. Snodgrass.
<P>
"I have a small telescope," said Ned, producing it from his pocket, "We'll
take a look through it," and he adjusted it, focusing it on the dark ring,
that was, every moment, growing closer and closer to the little group on
the hill.
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4>A LUCKY ESCAPE</h4>
<P>
"WHAT do you make it to be?" asked Jerry, as Ned was staring through the
glass.
<P>
"Cattle!"
<P>
"Cattle?"
<P>
"Yes, steers. Thousands of 'em. And they seem to be headed this way."
<P>
"Let me take a look," said Jerry. "You're right," he added, after an inspection.
"They seem to be coming on rather fast, too. I guess we'd better get out
of here. Cattle on the prairies don't like to see persons who are not on
horseback. They are not used to a man unless he's mounted, and I've read
that a man on foot may cause a stampede."
<P>
"I hope they don't run in this direction," remarked Bob. "It's going to be
unpleasant for us if they do."
<P>
"We'd better get out of here," advised Ned. "Come on, fellows."
<P>
"That's easier said than done," retorted Jerry.
<P>
"The cattle are all around us. I don't see how we're going to get through
them. If we go too close we may stampede 'em at once, whereas, if we stay
here, they may pass by us, or change their direction."
<P>
"What's the matter with the cowboys?" asked Rob. "Why don't they head the
animals the other way when they see we're right in the path?"
<P>
"Probably the cattlemen are on the outer edges of the herd," said Jerry.
"The cowboys can't see us, and they're simply driving the steers on."
<P>
"But what makes them go in a circle?" asked Bob.
<P>
"Probably the men are driving them all in to a central point to take account
of stock, or something like that," was Jerry's answer. "But, instead of standing
here talking of it we'd better be doing something. What do you advise,
Professor?"
<P>
Uriah Snodgrass, who had discovered some queer kind of a jumping bug in the
grass, had lost all interest in the approaching steers, but, at this question,
he looked up.
<P>
"What did you ask?" he said, making a grab for the bug, and catching it.
<P>
"What do you think we'd better do?" asked Ned. "This is getting serious."
<P>
"What is? Oh, the steers. Why, they are getting a little too close, aren't
they?"
<P>
They were, for a fact, and the animals in the foremost ranks, catching sight
of the little party on the hill, broke into awkward gallop. As far as the
boys could see, they beheld nothing but waving tails, heaving heads, armed
with long sharp horns, and the movement of brown bodies, as the thousands
of steers came on with a rush.
<P>
"We'd better&mdash;" began the professor, who was walking slowly along, his eyes
fixed on the ground, in search for another of the queer bugs. "Look out!"
he suddenly cried. "Stand back boys!"
<P>
Hardly had he spoken than there sounded, high and shrill above the dull rumble
of the oncoming cattle, a queer, buzzing noise.
<P>
"Rattlesna    " exclaimed Ned.
<P>
"Yes, a whole nest of them, in a prairie dog's hole," added the professor.
"I nearly stepped into them. There must be thirty or forty."
<P>
The boys looked to where he pointed. There, in a sort of depression, near
a little hollow, on the edge of what is called a prairie dog village, they
saw an ugly wiggling mass, which, as their eyes became more used to the
colorings, was seen to be a number of the deadly rattlesnakes.
<P>
Several were coiled to strike, and had, in accordance with their habit, sounded
their rattles. This had aroused the whole den, many snakes appearing from
under ground, or crawling from beneath stones.
<P>
"Come on! They'll chase us!" cried Bob.
<P>
"Nonsense," replied the professor. "Rattlesnakes never attack man unless
they are first disturbed. It wouldn't be advisable to go too close, but,
as long as we don't molest them, we have nothing to fear from the snakes.
I'd like to get a few specimens if I had the proper appliances for extracting
their fangs. But I never saw so many in one place, before. It is quite
interesting to watch&mdash;"
<P>
The professor broke off suddenly, for the thunderous noise of the approaching
steers was now louder.
<P>
"They're coming right at us!" exclaimed Jerry.
<P>
"Yes, and they've stampeded!" cried Ned. "We're in for it now!"
<P>
The situation of the boys and the professor was extremely perilous. They
were right in the path of the now frightened steers. The circle had been
broken, by many animals, which had been approaching from the rear of the
travelers, joining the beasts on either side, so that now a compact, dark
mass of cattle, nearly a quarter of a mile wide, was surging ahead with great
speed.
<P>
"Run!" called Ned. "There's an opening at our backs now!"
<P>
"You couldn't go a hundred feet before they'd overtake you!" shouted Jerry.
"Let's see if we can't frighten 'em. Take off your hats, jump up and down,
and yell like mad. If we can force 'em to separate and go on either side
of us, we'll be all right!"
<P>
He started to swing his hat in the air, and prepared to let out a series
of yells in imitation of an Indian war-whoop.
<P>
"Don't!" cried the professor quickly.
<P>
"Why not?" asked Jerry. "It's the only way to stop 'em."
<P>
"I know a better, and a surer way," replied the scientist. "Get the rattlesnakes
between ourselves and the cattle! Those steers will never go near a rattlesnake
den, no matter how frightened they are, nor how badly stampeded! Quick! Here
they come!"
<P>
The cattle were scarcely two hundred feet away, and were maddened by the
sight of unmounted persons, something to which they were unaccustomed, and
which thoroughly frightened them. The ground was trembling with their hoof-beats,
and the rattle of the horns, as they clashed together, was like the murmur
of cannibal tom-toms.
<P>
The professor grabbed Bob, who was nearest him, and swung the boy around,
so as to get the nest of rattlesnakes between them and the steers. Ned and
Jerry followed. The snakes, now all aroused, were rattling away like half
a hundred electric batteries working at once.
<P>
Would the professor's ruse succeed? Would the steers be afraid to come over
the deadly reptiles, to trample down the little group, which the animals
probably took for some new species of enemy? These were questions which the
boys waited anxiously to have answered. Nor did they have to wait long.
<P>
The foremost of the steers came within a few feet of the rattlers. Then something
seemed to stiffen the cattle. They tried to stop short, but the press of
the beasts behind them would not permit of this. For a few seconds it looked
as if the impetus of the cattle in the rear would shove the others on, in
spite of their desire to stop.
<P>
But now more of the foremost steers became aware of the den of snakes. Their
instinct, their sense of smell, and, above all, hearing the rattling, told
them the terrible danger that was in their path. More of the animals braced
their forelegs to bring themselves to a stop, and all bellowed in terror.
Then, almost as though an order had been given by some one in command, the
ranks of steers parted, right at the point where the snakes were reared ready
to strike.
<P>
To right and left the cattle passed, increasing their speed as they became
aware of the danger they were escaping. The boys and the professor stood
on the little eminence of land, as if they were on an island in a sea of
cattle. The angry snakes hissed and rattled, but did not glide away, or what
had proved a source of safety for the travelers, might have been instrumental
in their death.
<P>
Right past them rushed the cattle, raising a dust that was choking. The four
were enveloped in a yellow haze, as they stood huddled together. Then, the
last of the steers galloped past, with a band of excited cowboys in the rear,
vainly endeavoring to understand the cause of the stampede, and halt it.
As they rode on like the wind, they waved their hands to the boys and Mr.
Snodgrass.
<P>
"Well, I guess we can move on now," said Jerry, as the last of the steers
and cowboys was lost in a cloud of dust that accompanied them. "I've seen
all the beef I want to for a long time."
<P>
"That's the first time I ever knew rattlesnakes were good for anything,"
remarked Ned, as he backed away, with his eyes on the den of reptiles, as
if afraid they would spring at him.
<P>
"They are more feared by animals than any other snake in this country, I
believe," said the professor. "Luck was certainly with us to-day."
<P>
The professor successfully resisted a desire to capture some of the snakes
for specimens, and soon, with the three boys, he was on his way back to the
stalled train, though he did not make very fast progress for he was continually
stopping to gather in some strange insect.
<P>
It was long past dinner-time when the travelers got back, but they found
they were not the only ones in this predicament, for a number of the passengers
had beguiled the tediousness of the wait by going off across the prairie.
<P>
"Let's get the porter to get us some sandwiches, and then we'll watch 'em
get the train back on the track," suggested Jerry.
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<h4>AT THE SEABURYS'</h4>
<P>
THE wrecking crew had arrived shortly before the boys and the professor got
back, and there was a big crowd of passengers and train men around the laborers.
<P>
"Never mind eating," called Ned. "Come on, watch 'em. We can get a bite
afterward."
<P>
"Not for mine," sung out Bob, as he made a dive for the dining car. "I'll
be with you pretty soon."
<P>
"There he goes again," remarked Ned with a sigh. "I couldn't eat when there's
any excitement going on. I want to see how they get the cars on the track."
<P>
"So do I." said Jerry.
<P>
They pressed on to where, by means of powerful hydraulic jacks, men were
busy raising up the engine, which, because of its weight, had sunk quite
deeply into the ground. The jacks were small, but one man worked the handle,
which pumped water from one part of it to another, and elevated a piston,
that, in turn was forced up with terrible pressure, thus raising one end
of the ponderous locomotive.
<P>
When the wheels were clear of the earth other men slipped under them some
peculiar shaped pieces of iron, so arranged that when the locomotive was
pulled or pushed ahead by another engine, the wheels would slip upon the
rails.
<P>
In turn each of the wheels of the engine and tender were so fixed. Then word
was given the engineer of the relief train to back down and haul the derailed
locomotive back on to the track.
<P>
"All ready?" called the foreman of the wrecking crew.
<P>
"All ready," replied the engineer.
<P>
Jerry and Ned, in common with scores of others, were straining forward to
watch every detail of the task. They wanted to see whether the locomotive
would take to the rails, or slip off the inclined irons, and again settle
down upon the ground.
<P>
"Let her go, Bill," called the foreman to the engineer of the wrecking crew.
<P>
There was a warning whistle, a straining of heavy chains, creakings and groanings
from the derailed engine as if it objected to being pulled and hauled about,
then the ponderous driving wheels began to turn slowly.
<P>
"Stand clear, everybody!" cried the foreman.
<P>
At that moment Bob came running up, using the back of his hand as a napkin
for his lips.
<P>
"There she goes!" was the loud cry.
<P>
As the crowd looked, they saw the derailed and helpless engine give a sort
of shudder and shake, mount the inclined pieces of iron, and then slide upon
the rails, settling down where it belonged.
<P>
"Hurrah!" cried the passengers, in recognition of a hard task well accomplished.
<P>
"Well, I'm glad that's over," announced the foreman. "Now boys, hustle, and
we'll get the cars on, and the line will be clear."
<P>
It did not take long to get the cars on the rails, as they were lighter.
The damaged engine was switched off to one side, some rails, which had been
displaced when the train bumped off, were spiked down, and the wreck was
a thing of the past.
<P>
"All aboard!" called the conductor. "All aboard! Step lively now!"
<P>
The relief engine was not a fast one, being built more for power than speed,
and the train had to proceed along rather slowly. But the boys did not mind
this, as they had plenty to talk about, and they were interested in the country
through which they were traveling.
<P>
They arrived at Los Angeles somewhat behind their schedule, and did not leave
there as soon as they expected to, as Professor Snodgrass wanted to call
on a scientific friend, to learn something about the best place to hunt for
horned toads.
<P>
"It's all right, boys," he announced, when he returned to the Los Angeles
hotel, where the three chums had put up. "My friend says the vicinity of
San Felicity, where you are going to call on the Seaburys, is a grand place
for horned toads. Come, we will start at once."
<P>
They found, however, that they would have to wait until the next day for
a train. They started early the following morning, traveling through a stretch
of country where it seemed as if it was always summer. Back home there had
already been evidences of fall, before they left, but here there seemed to
be no hint of approaching winter.
<P>
"Oh, isn't this fine!" exclaimed Ned, breathing in the sweetly-scented air,
as he stuck his head from the car window. "It's like reading about some fairy
story!"
<P>
"It's better than reading it," said Jerry. "It's the real thing."
<P>
They arrived at San Felicity, shortly before noon. It was a very hot day,
though the morning had been cool, and the boys began to appreciate the fact
that they had come to a southern climate. There seemed to be no one at the
little railroad station, at which they were the only passengers to leave
the train. The train baggage man piled their trunks and valises in a heap
on the platform, the engine gave a farewell toot, and the travelers were
thus left alone, in what appeared a deserted locality.
<P>
"There doesn't seem to be much doing," observed Jerry. "Let's see now, Nellie
wrote that we were to take a stage to get to their house, but I don't see
any stage. Wonder where the station agent is?"
<P>
"Hark!" said the professor, raising his hand for silence. "What noise is
that? It sounds as if it might be a horned toad grunting. They make a noise
just like that."
<P>
"I would say it sounded more like some one snoring," ventured Ned.
<P>
"It is!" exclaimed Bob. "Here's the station agent asleep in the ticket office,"
and he looked in an open window, on the shady side of the platform. From
the interior came the sounds which indicated a person in deep slumber.
<P>
"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the professor. "I took him for a horned toad!
I hope he didn't hear me."
<P>
"No danger," remarked Jerry. "He's sound asleep. Even the train didn't wake
him up."
<P>
The four gazed in on the slumbering agent. Perhaps there was some mysterious
influence in the four pairs of eyes, for the man suddenly awakened with a
start, stared for a moment at the travelers gazing in on him, and then sat
up.
<P>
"Good day, se&ntilde;ors!" he exclaimed, and they saw that he was a Mexican.
"Do you wish tickets? If you do, I regret to inform you that the only train
for the day has gone. There will be none until to-morrow," and he prepared
to go to sleep again.
<P>
"Here!" cried Jerry. "We don't want any, tickets! We want to find the way
to Mr. Nathan Seabury's house, and to learn if there's a stage which goes
there."
<P>
"There is, se&ntilde;or," replied the agent, yawning, "but I doubt if the
driver is here. He seldom comes to meet the train, as there are very few
travelers. Will it not do to go to Se&ntilde;or Seabury's to-morrow, or next
day, or the day after?"
<P>
"Hardly," replied Jerry, who, as did the other boys, began to appreciate
the Mexican habit of saying "mananna" which means "to-morrow," for the Mexicans
have a lazy habit of putting off until to-morrow whatever they have to do
to-day. "We want to go to-day, right away, at once, now!"
<P>
"Ah, the se&ntilde;ors are Americanos&mdash;always in a hurry," answered the agent,
but in no unfriendly manner. "Very well, I will see if Hop Sing has his stage
here."
<P>
"Hop Sing?" questioned Ned.
<P>
"Yes, se&ntilde;or, he is a Chinaman. You will find him a very slow and careful
driver."
<P>
"Slow? I guess everything's slow down here," said Ned in a low voice.
<P>
The agent came leisurely from his office, walked to the end of the platform,
and, pointing toward a low shed, remarked:
<P>
"That is where the stage is kept. I will call, and see if Hop Sing is there."
<P>
Then he called, but in such a low tone, as if he was afraid he might strain
his voice, that it did not seem as if he could be heard ten feet away. Jerry
stood it as long as he could and then said:
<P>
"I guess Hop Sing must be taking his noon nap. I'll go over and wake him
up."
<P>
"Ah, the se&ntilde;or is in a hurry," and the Mexican agent smiled as though
that was a strange thing. "If he would wait an hour, or perhaps two, Hop
Sing might awaken. Besides, to-morrow&mdash;"
<P>
"Not for ours," said Ned. "We've got to go to-day."
<P>
The agent shrugged his shoulders, and went back into his little office to
resume his nap. Jerry walked over to the shed.
<P>
"Hey! Hop Sing!" he called, as he approached. "Where's the stage?"
<P>
"Want stage? Take lide? All lite! Me come! Chop-chop! Give number one, top-slide
lide!" exclaimed a voice, and a small Chinaman jumped down from the stage
seat, where, under the shade of the shed he had been sleeping, and began
to untie the halters of the mules that were attached to the ram-shackle old
vehicle.
<P>
"Be lite out!" Hop Sing went on. "Me glive you click lide. Me go fast! You
see! Chop-chop!"
<P>
"All right, if the old shebang doesn't fall apart on the way," said Jerry
with a laugh, as he saw the stage which the Celestial backed out of the shed.
Certainly it looked as if it could not go many miles.
<P>
"Come on!" called Jerry to Ned, Bob and the professor, who had remained on
the platform. "I guess it's safe. The mules don't look as if they would run
away."
<P>
They piled into the aged vehicle, and Hop Sing, with a quickness that was
in surprising contrast to the indolence of the Mexican agent, put their trunks
and valises on top.
<P>
"Now we glow click, you sabe?" he said, smiling from ear to ear. "Me know
Mlister Seablury. Him number one man, top-slide," which was Hop Sing's way
of saying that anything was the very best possible.
<P>
The boys soon found that while Hop Sing might be a slow and careful driver,
it was due more to the characters of the mules, than to anything else. The
Chinese yelled at them in a queer mixture of his own language, Mexican and
American. He belabored them with a whip, and yanked on the reins, but the
animals only ambled slowly along the sunny road, as if they had a certain
time schedule, and were determined to stick to it.
<P>
"Can't they go any faster?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Flaster?" asked Hop, innocently. "They Mlexican mules. No go flast. Me go
flast, mules not," and he began jumping up and down in his seat, as if that
would help matters any. He redoubled his yells and shouts, and made the whip
crack like a pistol, but the mules only wagged their ears and crawled along.
<P>
"I guess you'll have to let matters take their course while you're here,"
suggested the professor. "You can't change the habits of the people, or the
animals."
<P>
They did manage, after strenuous efforts on Hop's part, to get to the Seabury
bungalow. It was in the midst of a beautiful garden, and a long walk led
up to the house, around which was an adobe wall, with a red gate. Over the
gate was a roof, making a pleasant shade, and there were seats, where one
might rest.
<P>
In fact some one was resting there as the stage drove up. He was a colored
man, stretched out on his back, sound asleep.
<P>
"Well, I wonder if they do anything else in this country but sleep?" asked
Jerry.
<P>
"Why&mdash;that's Ponto, Mr. Seabury's negro helper," said Ned. "Hello, Ponto.
All aboard the <I>Wanderer!"</I>
<P>
"What's dat? Who done call me?" and the colored man sat up suddenly, rubbing
his eyes. "Who says <I>Wanderer? </I> Why dat boat&mdash;"
<P>
Then he caught sight of the travelers.
<P>
"Why, I 'clar' t' gracious!" he exclaimed. "Ef it ain't dem motor boys an'
Perfesser Snowgrass!"
<P>
"How are you, Ponto?" sang out Bob.
<P>
"Fine, sah! Dat's what I is! Fine. I 'clar' t' gracious I'se glad t' see
yo'! Git down offen dat stage! It'll fall apart in anoder minute! Go long
outer heah, yo' yellow trash!" and Ponto shook his fist at Hop Sing. "Wha'
fo' yo' stan' 'round heah, listen' t' what yo' betters sayin'."
<P>
"I guess I'd better pay him," said Jerry, and settled with the Celestial,
who drove slowly off.
<P>
"Now come right in!" exclaimed Ponto. "I were&mdash;I were jest thinkin' out dar
on dat bench&mdash;yais, sah, I were thinkin', an' fust thing I knowed I was 'sleep.
It's a turrible sleepy country, dat's what 'tis, fer a fact. I'se gittin'
in turrible lazy habits sence I come heah. But come on in. Massa Seabury,
he'll be powerful glad t' see yo'. So'll th' young ladies. Dey was sayin'
only las' night, dat it seemed laik dem boys nevah goin' t' come. But heah
yo' be! Yais, sah, I were jest thinkin' out on dat bench&mdash;"
<P>
But Panto's rambling talk was suddenly interrupted by a glad cry from the
shrubbery. Then there came a rush of skirts, and the boys saw three girls
running toward them.
<P>
"Here they are, dad!" called Nellie. "Here are the boys and Professor Snodgrass!
Oh, we're so glad you came! Welcome to 'The Next Day'! That's what we've
christened our bungalow, in honor of this lazy country. Come on in," and
she ran up to Jerry, holding out her hands.
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<h4>AFTER HORNED TOADS</h4>
<P>
OLIVIA and Rose, as had Nellie, warmly welcomed the boys and Professor Snodgrass,
and, Mr. Seabury coming up a moment later, from his usual stroll about the
garden, added his greetings.
<P>
"We're very glad to see you," said the gentleman. "Come right in and make
yourselves comfortable. We have more room than we had on the houseboat
<I>Wanderer. </I> I'll have your baggage&mdash;where is that black rascal,
Ponto?&mdash;Ponto!"
<P>
"Yais, sah, I'se coming," called a voice, and Ponto who had gone back to
the gate appeared, rubbing his eyes.
<P>
"Ponto, take these&mdash;why, you&mdash;you've been asleep again, I do believe&mdash;Ponto&mdash;"
<P>
"I&mdash;I done gone an' jest dozed off fo' a minute, Massa Seabury," said Ponto.
"I 'clar' t' goodness, dis am de most sleepiest climate I eber see. Peers
laik I cain't do nuffin, but shet mah eyes an'&mdash;"
<P>
"Well if you don't do something mighty quick with this baggage I'll find
some way of keeping you awake," spoke Mr. Seabury, but he was laughing in
spite of himself.
<P>
"Yais, sah, I'se goin' t' take keer of it immejeet, sah," and the colored
man went off in search of a wheelbarrow, on which to bring the trunks and
valises up to the house from where they had been put off the stage.
<P>
"I never saw such a chap," said Mr. Seabury. "Before we came down here he
was as spry as I could wish, but now he does just as the Mexicans do. He
sleeps every chance he gets. But come on in. I know you must be tired and
hungry."
<P>
"Bob is," said Jerry. "I heard him say a while ago&mdash;"
<P>
"No, you didn't hear me say anything," exclaimed Bob quickly, fearful lest
he might be put to shame before the girls. "I'm not a bit hungry."
<P>
"Fibber!" whispered Ned, though not so low but what they all heard, and the
girls burst into laughter.
<P>
"Never mind," spoke Olivia. "Come on, Bob. I'll take care of you. The cook
and I are great friends," and the girl and Bob walked on ahead.
<P>
"I suppose you came out here to study some new kind of plant or flowers,
didn't you?" asked Mr. Seabury, of the professor.
<P>
"Not exactly," replied the scientist, "though I shall examine them with much
interest. What I came down for was to secure some specimens of horned toads
for the museum. I&mdash;"
<P>
"Horned toads!" exclaimed Nellie, who was walking with Jerry, while Rose
had volunteered to show Ned the beauties of the Mexican garden. "Horned toads!
Ugh! The horrible things. I hope you don't bring them around where I am,
Professor. Horned toads! Why don't you search after something beautiful,
like the wonderful butterfly you found in Florida?"
<P>
"A horned toad is just as beautiful as a butterfly," said Mr. Snodgrass gravely.
"The only difference is, people don't appreciate the toad. I do, and, some
day, I hope to write a history of that creature. I have my notes ready for
the first volume, which will be a sort of introduction."
<P>
"How many volumes do you expect to write?" asked Mr. Seabury, curiously.
<P>
"Twelve," replied the scientist calmly. "Even then I will have to omit much
that is of interest. But I hope, in twelve, large books, to be able to convey
some idea of horned toads, as well as some information about the other species."
<P>
"Twelve volumes! I should hope so!" murmured Mr. Seabury.
<P>
By this time the travelers were at the bungalow. It was a well-arranged affair,
quite large, and set in the midst of a beautiful garden, with rambling paths,
and shady bowers, while the whole place was enclosed by a mud or adobe wall.
All around the bungalow was a wide veranda, and in the center courtyard was
a small fountain, with a jet of water spurting up from the middle of a large
shell.
<P>
"Isn't this fine!" exclaimed Jerry, and the other boys agreed it was.
<P>
"Yes, we like 'The Next Day' very much," said Nellie. "It was my idea to
call it that. From the very moment we arrived, and wanted something done,
about the only answer we could get was 'to-morrow,' 'Mananna' or 'the next
day,' so I decided that would be a good name for the bungalow."
<P>
"Indeed it is," declared the professor. "But you have a most delightful place,
and I should like to spend many 'next days' here. I hope your health is better,
Mr. Seabury?"
<P>
"Considerably so, sir. I find the air here agrees with my nerves and rheumatism
much better than in Florida. I have hopes of entirely recovering. But let
us go inside, I think luncheon is ready."
<P>
It was and, in the cool dining-room, within sound of the tinkling fountain,
they ate a hearty meal, Bob demonstrating in his usual fashion that he was
quite hungry.
<P>
The girls took turns in explaining their experiences since coming to California.
The bungalow, which they rented, was on the outskirts of the village of San
Felicity, which was part of what had once been an old Mexican town. It was
located on the shores of a secluded bay, and the bungalow was about ten minutes'
walk from the water.
<P>
"Do you think there are any horned toads around here?" asked the professor,
when the meal was finished, and they had gone out on the veranda.
<P>
"I don't know, I'm sure," replied Mr. Seabury. "I'll ask Ponto, he knows
everything there is to be known about this place. Ponto! I say, Ponto!"
<P>
"Yais, sah, I'se comin' sah!" and from somewhere in the depths of the garden
the voice sounded. A moment later the colored man appeared, trying to hide
a broad yawn.
<P>
"Ponto, do you know&mdash;well, I declare, if you haven't been asleep again!"
<P>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I jest was weedin' de garden, Massa Seabury, an' I done felt so
warm dat I jest closed mah eyes, jest fo' a second, not a minute longer,
no sah, not a minute. Guess I knows better dan t' go t' sleep when yo' got
company sah!" and Ponto looked very much hurt at the accusation.
<P>
"Well, Ponto, I suppose you can't help it. Do you happen to know where there
are any horned toads?"
<P>
"Horned toads! Good lan', Massa Seabury! No sah! I ain't got none!"
<P>
"I didn't suppose you had. Do you know whether there are any around here?"
<P>
"Well, I doan know ef dey has horns or not, but de oder day, when I were
comin' home from goin' t' ole Mexican Pete's shanty after some red peppers,
I seen some horrible kind of thing hoppin' along ober de sand. I&mdash;I didn't
stop t' look an' see ef he had horns, but I s'pects he had, cause he were
kind of diggin' in de sand."
<P>
"That's the toad all right!" exclaimed the professor, joyfully. "Where is
the place? Take me out there right away, Ponto."
<P>
"Take you out dere, Perfesser?"
<P>
"Yes, right away."
<P>
"I&mdash;I s'pects I'd better go back an' 'tend t' mah weedin'!" exclaimed Ponto,
looking as pale as a colored man can. look. "Weeds grow powerful fast in
dis climate. Dey'll choke de flowers in about an hour. I'se got t' 'tend
t' 'em immejeet, sah. I ain't got no time t' go huntin' horned toads. I hopes
you'll 'scuse me, sah," and with that Ponto was gone, walking faster than
he had at any time since the travelers arrived.
<P>
"He's afraid," said Rose, with a laugh. "I'm not. Come on, Professor, I'll
show you where Ponto means, and maybe we can find some horned toads."
<P>
"Let's all go," proposed Jerry.
<P>
"I will, if you'll promise not to let the horrible things come near me,"
said Nellie, and Jerry promised.
<P>
Mr. Seabury declared he would rather rest on the veranda than hunt horned
toads, so the three boys and the trio of girls, with the professor, who armed
himself with specimen boxes and a small net, set off after the curious reptiles.
<P>
A short distance from the bungalow there was a sort of sandy stretch, where
little grew in the way of vegetation, and there, Rose explained, was probably
where Ponto had seen the toads. They headed toward it, the scientist eagerly
looking on the ground, for a first sight of the specimens he had come so
far to seek.
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4>A STRANGE MEETING</h4>
<P>
"I GUESS Ponto must have been asleep when he was walking along here, and
dreamed he saw those toads," commented Ned, after the party had covered a
considerable part of the sandy stretch without getting a glimpse of the ugly
reptiles.
<P>
"That's too bad!" exclaimed the professor. "I had hopes of finding one here."
<P>
"Oh!" suddenly screamed Rose. "There's one!"
<P>
"Where?" asked the scientist eagerly.
<P>
"Right there, by that stone. I saw it jump. Oh, girls, I'm going to run!"
<P>
"And she said she wasn't afraid of them!" cried Nellie.
<P>
The professor cautiously approached with his net outstretched. With a long
stick he turned the boulder over, and made a quick movement with his net,
imprisoning something beneath it.
<P>
"I've got it!" he cried. "I have the horned toad!"
<P>
Holding his captive down beneath the net, he leaned forward on his knees,
to get a better view. Over his face came a look of disappointment.
<P>
"It's only a harmless lizard," he said, "and not one of the web-footed variety,
either. That's too bad. I thought I had my toad."
<P>
"I'm glad, Professor," said Rose. "Oh, no," she added quickly, "I'm sorry
for you, but I'm glad it wasn't a horned toad so close to me."
<P>
The professor raised the net and the lizard scurried away, probably very
much frightened, and wondering what all the excitement was about.
<P>
"Let's go over this way," suggested Ned.
<P>
"That looks as if it might be a good place for toads," and he pointed to
where there was a clump of trees.
<P>
"Can you tell where horned toads like to stay?" asked Olivia.
<P>
"No," replied Ned, in a low voice, "but it's shady over there, and this sun,
beating down on the sand, is very hot. I wanted to get where it's cool, and,
anyhow, there's just as liable to be horned toads there as anywhere. If he
doesn't find a toad he'll find something else that will make him nearly as
happy, so it's all the same."
<P>
"Isn't he a queer man," said Olivia, as they followed along behind Mr. Snodgrass,
who was walking ahead, closely scanning the ground.
<P>
"He is, but he's a good friend of ours," replied Ned. "He is very much in
earnest over his collection of insects and reptiles, and, though he acts
queerly at times, he is one of the best men in the world."
<P>
"I'm sure he must be," agreed Olivia. "I like him very much. I hope he stays
a long time, and I hope you boys do also. It's quite lonesome here, with
nothing but Mexicans and Chinese for the main part of the population."
<P>
"We'll stay as long as you let us," said Ned.
<P>
"We can have fine times," went on the girl. "We can go boating on the little
bay, and take trips off into the country. We, ourselves, haven't seen much
of it yet, as papa was not feeling well when we first came, and we had to
stay home and care for him. But he is better now, and we can go on little
excursions.
<P>
Ned's harmless trick to get the party to a shady spot was successful. The
professor headed for the little clump of trees looking, the while, for a
horned toad, but he saw none of the queer creatures.
<P>
"My, but it's hot!" exclaimed Bob, as he sat down on the ground.
<P>
"Oh, it will be worse than this, some days," said Rose. "We are getting used
to it. But suppose we go down to the seashore? It's not far, and there is
a very pretty view."
<P>
"Perhaps I can get a horned toad there," put in the professor hopefully.
<P>
After a short rest in the shade the little party headed for the beach. As
they came in sight of it from a small hill, the boys uttered exclamations
of delight, for a beautiful expanse of water was stretched out before them,&mdash;the
Pacific ocean sparkling blue in the sun.
<P>
"Oh, for our motor boat!" exclaimed Jerry. "Oh, for the <I>Dartaway! </I>
Couldn't we have fine sport in her, out on that bay!"
<P>
"Don't speak of it!" said Ned with a groan.
<P>
"What, is the <I>Dartaway</I> lost?" asked Rose.
<P>
"Gone! Busted! Smashed!" exclaimed Bob, and the boys all tried to talk at
once, telling of the disaster that had befallen their craft.
<P>
"It's too bad," declared Olivia. "But never mind. We have a couple of rowboats,
and maybe you can hire a little sailing skiff."
<P>
"It wouldn't be the <I>Dartaway,"</I> answered Bob, with a sigh. "That boat
had the nicest little kitchen in it&mdash;"
<P>
"So, that's all you cared about her for&mdash;the kitchen&mdash;where you could cook
something to eat!" exclaimed Jerry. "Chunky, I'm ashamed of you; that's what
I am!"
<P>
"Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;" began Bob. "Oh, come on," he continued, and led the way
down to the beach, where there were some bathing pavilions and several houses.
The professor was walking along behind, in the vain hope of yet discovering
a horned toad, perhaps on its way to get a dip in the surf or drink some
salt water.
<P>
"I think you'll like some chocolate," said Nellie, as the boys were in front
of a little refreshment booth. "It is made by a Mexican&mdash;"
<P>
She stopped, for she saw that the boys were not listening to her. Their attention
was drawn to a man who was just coming from the place they were going in.
The boys could not help staring at him, for he was the man who had acted
so strangely in the freight depot at Cresville.
<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<h4>A QUEER STORY</h4>
<P>
FOR several seconds the boys and the man stared at one another. The stranger
did not seem to be the least bit embarrassed but, on the contrary, was smiling
in a genial manner.
<P>
"Is he a friend of yours?" asked Nellie, of Jerry.
<P>
"Well, not exactly what you could call a friend," was the answer. "We don't
even know his name," and he spoke in a low voice. "We saw him back in Cresville,
just before we started out west, and he was acting in a strange manner. We
thought&mdash;"
<P>
"Excuse me," suddenly interrupted the strange man, advancing toward the group
of boys and girls, "but haven't I seen you lads before? Your faces are very
familiar."
<P>
"We saw you in the Cresville freight office," declared Ned boldly.
<P>
"Exactly! I knew it was somewhere. I remember now. I was there attending
to some goods that had to be shipped in a hurry. I'm glad you remembered
me. To think that I should meet you away out here! It's a small world, isn't
it?" and he smiled, but there was something in his smile, in his looks and
in his manner that the boys did not like. Neither did the girls, for, as
Nellie said afterward, he acted as though he wanted to make friends so you
would not be suspicious of him.
<P>
"Shake hands, won't you?" asked the man, advancing closer to the boys. "My
name is Carson Blowitz, and though it sounds foreign I was born in this country.
I travel around so much I can't give you any particular place as my residence."
<P>
There was no way without being rude of avoiding shaking hands with the man,
and, though there was something in his manner that caused the boys to feel
a distrust of him, they were not going to be impolite on mere suspicion.
<P>
They shook hands with Mr. Blowitz, and Jerry introduced himself, his chums,
the young ladies and Professor Snodgrass, and told, briefly, the object of
their trip.
<P>
"Well isn't that nice, now," said Mr. Blowitz, when Jerry had finished. "The
professor comes out here to hunt horned toads, and you lads come to hunt
adventures, Mr. Seabury comes out here in search of health and I&mdash;well, I'm
out here on a sort of hunt myself."
<P>
"Are you interested in science?" asked Mr. Snodgrass eagerly. "Perhaps you
and I might go off together after horned toads and web-footed lizards. Or,
if you care for snakes, or insects, I think I can show you where there are
plenty."
<P>
"No, no," said Mr. Blowitz, with a laugh, which he tried to make sound hearty
by the mere noise of it. "No, I'm on a different sort of a search. In fact
it's quite a queer story&mdash;perhaps you would like to hear it. In fact, I'm
hunting for a lost ship."
<P>
"A lost ship!" exclaimed Bob.
<P>
"Well, one that was abandoned just before she sank, and that's about the
same thing. It was abandoned quite a way out, but off this part of the coast.
There is a current setting in towards shore, at this point, I'm told, and
I thought I might get some news of her, or find some of the wreckage floating
in on the beach. That's why you find me here."
<P>
"What ship is it?" asked Ned, interested in spite of the aversion he and
the others felt toward Mr. Blowitz.
<P>
"It is a brig, <I>Rockhaven</I> by name. But suppose we go inside'? It is
rather warm out here in the sun, and I'm not quite used to this climate yet.
Won't you come in and have some chocolate with me? They have a very nice
drink in here, and I&mdash;"
<P>
"It's my treat," interrupted Bob.
<P>
"No; if I may be so bold as to insist, you must be my guests this time,"
went on Mr. Blowitz. "It is not often that I see lads away off east and meet
them a little later, in California, so I must have the pleasure of their
company for a little while. The young ladies too&mdash;I'm very fond of young
ladies," and Mr. Blowitz smiled in a manner that Rose characterized later
as "ugly," though just why she thought so she couldn't explain.
<P>
There was no way of getting gracefully out of the invitation, and so the
crowd of young people and the professor accompanied Mr. Blowitz into the
refreshment booth.
<P>
They went out into the shaded courtyard, where a fountain of splashing water
at least gave the effect of coolness, if it did not really make it so. They
sat at small tables, and were served with cold chocolate and sweet cakes,
by a pretty Mexican girl. Bob wanted to pay for the treat but Mr. Blowitz
would not hear of it. In fact he played the host in such a genial way, and
seemed so anxious to make every one have a good time, that the boys were
rather ashamed of their first opinion of him.
<P>
Even Rose whispered to Bob that "he was not so bad, when you got acquainted
with him."
<P>
"Now I suppose you would like to hear the story of the abandoning of the
brig <I>Rockhaven,"</I> said Mr. Blowitz, and the boys nodded.
<P>
"I hope no one was drowned," exclaimed Olivia.
<P>
"Not as far as we know," replied Mr. Blowitz. "The whole affair is rather
mysterious, and I am seeking information about the fate of the ship as much
as anything else."
<P>
"I would like to ask you one question," said Professor Snodgrass, who had
been more interested in the antics of a small bug, walking on the table,
than he was in his chocolate.
<P>
"What is it?" inquired Mr. Blowitz.
<P>
"Did you, or any of your men notice whether, just before the ship sank, that
all the rats on board deserted it?" asked the scientist. "I have often heard
that rats will desert a sinking ship, and I would like to know whether it
is true. If you made any observations to that effect I wish you would tell
me about them, and I can put them into a book I am writing about rats and
mice."
<P>
"I thought you were writing about horned toads," said Bob.
<P>
"So I am, but this is another book. This will be in seventeen volumes, with
colored plates. I want to get all the information I can, about rats."
<P>
"I'm sorry that I can't help you," replied Mr. Blowitz. "In fact I know little
about the abandoning of the brig, except what I heard. I was not aboard,
and I don't know whether the rats left it or not. All I know is that the
vessel is lost, and with a fortune aboard."
<P>
"A fortune aboard?" inquired Ned.
<P>
"Yes, worth about a quarter of a million."
<P>
"Is it gold or diamonds?" asked Rose, who was very fond of jewelry and precious
stones.
<P>
"Neither one, my dear young lady," said Mr. Blowitz, with as happy a smile
as he could assume. "It is valuable merchandise. Of course there was some
money, and some valuable papers, but the main part of the cargo was costly
merchandise. I'll tell you how it happened. But first, let us have some more
chocolate," and he called to the Mexican girl waiter.
<P>
When the cups had been filled Mr. Blowitz resumed his story.
<P>
"I am interested in many enterprises," he said, "and I and some other men
went into a venture to ship some valuable goods to the Santa Barbara islands,
which are not far off this coast. I was the principal owner, having bought
out my partner, and it looked as if I would make a large sum.
<P>
"The vessel sailed from San Francisco, and as the weather was fine, we looked
for a quick trip. I was attending to some of my other business affairs, having
just arrived on this coast from Boston, when I received a telegram from the
captain of the brig, telling me that she had been abandoned with everything
on board. Of course there must have been an accident. Probably there was
a collision, or fire on board, so that the brig was in a sinking condition.
At any rate the captain, and, I suppose the crew, also, left her. That's
why I can't tell whether they were all saved, though I assume so, as nothing
was said about any one being lost.
<P>
"The captain, it appears, was picked up By another vessel, and landed at
a small coast town. He sent me the telegram from there, and I forwarded him
money to come to San Francisco, to meet me. But, for some reason, he did
not arrive, and so I decided to come down here, and see if I could get any
news of the ship and the valuable cargo. Of course, if the ship sank at once
that is the end of her, but, if she broke up, there is a chance of some parts
of her, and perhaps some of the cargo, being washed ashore. At any rate I
would like to get some news of her, that I might collect the insurance, if
nothing else.
<P>
"So that's why I'm here. I arrived yesterday, but, so far, I have been unable
to obtain any news of the brig. I left word for the captain to join me here,
and he may arrive at any time. I am glad to have met you, for it will not
be so lonesome now."
<P>
"I hope you have good luck," said Nellie, as she arose to leave the place.
"I think we must be going now," she added to her sisters. "Papa might worry
about us."
<P>
"Give Mr. Seabury my regards," said Carson Blowitz, "and tell him I shall
do myself the honor of calling on him soon, to pay my respects. As for you
young people, I shall see you again, I hope. I am going to hire a boat and
cruise about in search of my brig&mdash;if I don't get some news soon&mdash;and perhaps
you might like to go along."
<P>
"Perhaps," replied Jerry, as he and his chums followed the girls out of the
place.
<P>
Mr. Blowitz remained in the courtyard, drinking chocolate, and, as the little
party was leaving Ned looked back. He saw their recent host pull a bundle
of papers from his pocket, and, spreading them on the table in front of him,
closely scan them.
<P>
"I don't like that man," declared Nellie, when they were out of hearing.
She was very frank in her statements.
<P>
"Neither do I," said Jerry, "though he was nice enough to us."
<P>
"He has a strange manner," commented Olivia.
<P>
"And that was a queer story he told of the abandoning of the brig," went
on Bob. "I wonder if he made it up, or if it's true? It seems strange that
the captain would leave his ship, and not give a reason for it."
<P>
"There's some mystery back of it, I think," was the opinion of Rose. "The
less we have to do with Mr. Carson Blowitz, the better it will be, I think."
<P>
"Well, we're not likely to see much of him." said Jerry. But in this opinion
he was mistaken. They were to see and hear much of him, as later events proved.
<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<h4>IN A MOTOR BOAT</h4>
<P>
SEVERAL days after this, during which time the boys had, under the escort
of the three girls, visited many places of interest, Rose suggested they
make a trip on the bay.
<P>
"But what can we go in?" asked Bob. "We haven't any boat."
<P>
"We have several rowing skiffs," said Nellie. "I know they are not as fine
as your <I>Dartaway, </I> but you can have a nice time. The fishing is good,
and it is very pleasant on the water."
<P>
"It would be pleasant wherever you girls were," said Ned, with an attempt
at gallantry.
<P>
"Thank you!" exclaimed Nellie, making a low, bow.
<P>
"You're improving, Ned," remarked Jeer, critically. "In time you'll be able
to go out in polite society."
<P>
"Oh, is that so'?" remarked Ned, sarcastically, "Thank you."
<P>
"You're welcome," retorted Jerry, bowing low.
<P>
"Oh, stow that away for use at some future time," advised Bob. "Come on,
if we're going out in a boat."
<P>
There was a little wharf, at which the Seaburys kept a couple of rowboats,
and, as six were too many to go into one craft, Nellie and Jerry occupied
the smaller, while Bob and Ned, Olivia and Rose, got into the other.
<P>
"Where shall we go?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Oh, row around anywhere," replied Jerry. "We'll have to get used to oars,
we haven't handled 'em in quite a while."
<P>
The boys soon found that the skill with which they had formerly used the
ashen blades, before the era of their motor boat, was coming back to them,
and they sent the skiffs around the bay at fairly good speed, the two crafts
keeping close together.
<P>
"This is something like work," announced Jerry, as he rested on his oars,
and let the boat drift with the tide, which was running in.
<P>
"That's what it is," declared Ned. "I wish&mdash;"
<P>
"Thank you!" exclaimed Olivia. "I'm sure we're very sorry that we have given
you so much work. We didn't know we were so heavy; did we girls?"
<P>
"No, indeed!" chimed in Rose. "If you will kindly row us back to shore, we'll
get out and you boys can go where you please. Work! The idea!"
<P>
"Oh, I say now!" cried Ned, alarmed at the effect of his words. "I didn't
mean&mdash;Jerry didn't mean&mdash;we&mdash;"
<P>
"Of course not!" added Jerry. "I only said&mdash;"
<P>
"You said it was hard work to row us around," declared Nellie in rather icy
tones.
<P>
"Well I meant&mdash;you see since we had a motor boat&mdash;that is I&mdash;we&mdash;it's rather&mdash;"
<P>
"Now don't try to get out of it and make it worse," advised Olivia. "We know
what you said, and what you meant."
<P>
"I didn't say anything," put in Bob, with an air of virtue.
<P>
"Good reason," declared Jerry. "You're so busy eating that cocoanut candy
that you didn't have time to speak. Besides you're not rowing."
<P>
"Oh, has he got cocoanut candy!" cried Nellie. "Give me some and we'll forgive
you for the rude way you and Ned spoke, Jerry. Won't we girls?"
<P>
"Of course," chorused Olivia and Rose.
<P>
"I&mdash;I didn't know you cared for cocoanut candy," declared Bob, rather ashamed
that he had not, before this, offered the girls some.
<P>
"Oh, don't we though!" exclaimed Nellie. "Just you pass some over and you'll
see, Bob," for the two boats had drifted close together.
<P>
Bob, who had purchased a big bag full of the confection, before they had
started for the row, passed it over, and the girls helped themselves generously.
<P>
"Take it all," advised Ned, who, perhaps, felt a little vindictive at Bob,
because of that youth's lucky escape from displeasing the girls by unfortunate
remarks.
<P>
"No, thank you, we don't want to rob him," said Olivia.
<P>
At that moment a shrill whistle sounded just behind the rowboats and the
girls turned around to see what it was. Ned and Jerry, from the position
in which they sat to handle the oars had seen a motor boat approaching, and
they had stopped using the blades to watch its approach.
<P>
"Oh, that's the <I>Ripper!"</I> exclaimed Rose. "And Charlie Farson is all
alone in her. Maybe he'll give us a ride."
<P>
"Who is Charlie Farson?" asked Jerry of Nellie.
<P>
"He's a friend of Rose. He lives in San Francisco, but he is staying with
his uncle at a bungalow about two miles from where we are. He owns that motor
boat, and it's the biggest and fastest on this part of the coast. Sometimes
he takes us out with him. I hope he does so now. He's headed right this way."
<P>
"Um," grunted Jerry, not altogether pleased that a young fellow with a motor
boat should come along, and claim the girls who, of course, would naturally
prefer a power craft to one propelled by oars.
<P>
Rose waved her handkerchief and, in answer the captain of the <I>Ripper</I>
sent out three shrill blasts as a salute.
<P>
"Oh, isn't that fine! He's coming over here!" exclaimed Rose. "I'll introduce
you boys to him."
<P>
Neither Ned nor Bob looked very pleased at the prospect of meeting a youth
who might be a rival in entertaining the girls, but there was no help for
it.
<P>
On came the <I>Ripper, </I> and, as she approached, the motor boys could
not help admiring her. The craft was powerful and swift, much more so than
the <I>Dartaway</I> had been. It was considerably larger, too, and had an
enclosed cabin.
<P>
"That's a dandy!" exclaimed Jerry in spite of himself.
<P>
"It's a peach!" was Ned's half-spoken comment.
<P>
"All to the mustard!" came Bob's characteristic comment.
<P>
"Want a ride, or a tow?" called Charlie Farson, when he got within hailing
distance, and he slowed down his craft.
<P>
"I guess we'll ride, if you'll tow our boats," replied Rose, for she knew
the young fellow fairly well.
<P>
"All right, come aboard."
<P>
By this time the <I>Ripper</I> was quite close, and, in another moment it
had come alongside of the boat containing Rose, Olivia, Ned and Bob.
<P>
"These are some friends of ours from the east," said Rose, introducing Ned
and Bob, "There's another one, in that boat with Nellie," she went on, telling
Jerry's name.
<P>
"I'm sure I'm glad to meet you all," said Charlie Farson, with such good
nature, that the boys could feel no resentment toward him. "Come aboard,
and we'll go for a spin. I guess it will be best to anchor your two boats
here and you can pick them up when we come back. We can make better time
then."
<P>
"Oh, your boat always makes good time," complimented Nellie, as she made
her way to the cabin of the <I>Ripper. </I> "That's the only objection I
have. You run her so fast that if you ever hit anything it would sink your
boat before you had time to jump overboard."
<P>
"But I'm not going to hit anything," declared Charlie.
<P>
He tied the two rowboats together, the other boys helping him, and then anchored
them with a small, spare kedge he carried on his craft.
<P>
"All ready?" he asked, looking to see that his passengers were comfortably
seated.
<P>
"Already, Captain Charlie," answered Rose.
<P>
"Here we go then," and Charlie threw in the dutch of the engine, that had
not ceased working,
<P>
The <I>Ripper</I> fairly flew away, so suddenly that Bob, who was near the
stern, nearly toppled overboard.
<P>
"Look out!" cried Charlie.
<P>
"Oh, I'm looking out now," said Bob. "Say, but she can go!"
<P>
"Yes, she has some speed," modestly admitted Charlie.
<P>
He turned on more gasolene and advanced the spark still further, so that
the boat increased her rate, piling up waves of white foam on either side.
<P>
They had a fine trip about the bay, the girls and boys thoroughly enjoying
themselves, the latter being particularly interested in the engine part of
the craft. The motor boys told the other lad of the <I>Dartaway</I> and how
the craft had been destroyed.
<P>
"My, but I certainly would like to run this boat," announced Jerry with a
sigh. "She's a dandy!"
<P>
"Maybe you'll get the chance," said Charlie.
<P>
"The chance? How? What do you mean?" asked Jerry, while his two chums eagerly
waited for Charlie's answer.
<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<h4>CAUGHT IN THE FOG</h4>
<P>
"WELL," replied Charlie as he sent the <I>Ripper</I> around in a big circle,
"you see it's this way. I came down here expecting to stay with my uncle
until Spring. I was going to learn how to raise oranges. I received word
this morning that I would have to go back to my home in San Francisco. My
father needs me there, because of a change in his business, and I've got
to go."
<P>
"That's too bad!" exclaimed Rose.
<P>
"I guess you are thinking more of his motor boat than you are of Charlie,"
said Nellie, with a laugh at her sister.
<P>
"I was not!" declared Rose, indignantly.
<P>
"Well, I've got to leave my boat here," went on Charlie.
<P>
"Leave it here!" repeated Olivia.
<P>
"Yes, and I'm looking for some one to take charge of it while I'm gone."
<P>
"Take charge of it!" exclaimed Ned and Bob at once, while a joyous look came
into Jerry's eyes.
<P>
"What I mean," said Charlie, "is that I would hire it out. I think that would
be a better plan than merely to loan it to some one, for there is a chance
that it might be damaged, and would have to be repaired, and, if I got a
reasonable rent for it that would cover such a mishap."
<P>
"Would you hire it to us?" asked Jerry anxiously.
<P>
"I was thinking of that," answered the owner of the <I>Ripper. </I> "I heard
from my friend, Rose," and he looked at the girl, "that you boys had had
some experience with motor boats. I had rather hire mine out to some one
who knew about machinery, than to persons who would have to learn. So, if
we can make some deal, you may have a chance to run this boat. I've got to
go to San Francisco in about a week."
<P>
"We'll take the boat," said Jerry quickly, "that is&mdash;"
<P>
"Oh, you needn't be afraid I'll ask too much money for her," interposed Charlie.
"All I want is enough to pay for any possible damages, and for reasonable
wear and tear. We'll talk it over later."
<P>
"Say, isn't that glorious!" whispered Ned to Bob. "Think of having a motor
boat, and cruising on the Pacific! We're getting to be like Sinbad the sailor,
making voyages all over."
<P>
"Yes, but maybe he'll want a small fortune for the hire of the
<I>Ripper,"</I> objected Bob. "We haven't any too much money, for this trip
was rather costly."
<P>
"If we could get damages for the <I>Dartaway, </I> we&mdash;"
<P>
"Yes, but 'if' is a big word, even though it only has two letters," replied
Bob quickly. "However, we'll do our best to get the <I>Ripper</I> during
our stay here, and we'll take the girls out for some nice rides."
<P>
"That's what we will."
<P>
Charlie speeded his boat about the bay for some time longer, and then; as
the girls said they thought they had better go home, he put back, picked
up the anchored boats, and the motor boys and their hosts were soon rowing
to shore.
<P>
"Come over any evening, Charlie," called Rose.
<P>
"Yes, come to-night," urged Jerry. "We can talk over the boat proposition
then."
<P>
"I'll be there," replied the <I>Ripper's</I> skipper, as he put about and
went whizzing over the blue waters of the bay.
<P>
When the young people entered the gateway they saw Ponto stretched out on
the bench in the shade, fast asleep.
<P>
"Wait a minute," said Rose. "I'll play a trick on him."
<P>
She stole softly up, and, with a long piece of grass tickled the old colored
servant on the ear. He put up his hand and sat up with a start.
<P>
"I 'clar' t' goodness!" he said, "I were jest waitin' fo' yo', an' I close
mah eyes, jest fo' one little second, but dis atmosphere am so slumberous
dat, 'fore I knows it, I'm sort of noddin'."
<P>
"I guess you were more than nodding," said Olivia. "But why were you waiting
for us, Ponto?"
<P>
"'Deed an' I didn't no mo' dan nod, Miss Olivia, dat's what I didn't. But
I'se been waitin' heah a pow'ful long time, an' I jest natcherly done gone
an' fell t' noddin'."
<P>
"But what were you waiting for?" persisted Olivia.
<P>
"Dis letter," replied the colored man. "Massa Seabury done tole me t' give
it t' one ob de young gentlemen what had de motor boat. He say it come from
Cresville, an' it might be important, so I done set heah waitin', but I done
forgot which young gentlemen he tole me t' gib it to."
<P>
"Let me see it," said Rose, and she looked at the envelope.
<P>
"It's for you, Jerry," she declared, "and it's from some railroad company.
It's been sent on here from Cresville."
<P>
"Maybe it's about damages to our boat," said Bob.
<P>
And so it proved. The letter announced that an investigation had been made
of the wreck in which the <I>Dartaway</I> was smashed, that the claim department
of the Florida Coast Railway Company admitted their liability, and were prepared
to pay damages. They enclosed in the letter a check for the value of the
boat, as declared by Jerry at the time of the shipment.
<P>
"Hurrah!" cried Ned. "That's the stuff!"
<P>
"Well, it's the end of the <I>Dartaway,"</I> observed Jerry. "Poor old boat!
I suppose we had better accept this sum, and not sue, eh?" and he looked
at his chums.
<P>
"Sure," replied Bob. "If we sued it would take a good while to collect, and
if we got a larger sum we'd have to pay the lawyers. Let's take this money
and hire the <I>Ripper."</I>
<P>
"I don't believe you'll need all that," interposed Rose. "That's quite a
sum, and Charlie will surely not ask as much as that for the hire of his
boat."
<P>
"Well, if he does we'll pay it," decided Jerry. "I want to cruise on the
Pacific, and this seems to be the only way we can do it. We'll have a motor
boat trip, even of the <I>Dartaway</I> is out of commission."
<P>
Charlie came over to "The Next Day" bungalow that night and in a short time
he and the motor boys had arrived at a business arrangement regarding the
hiring of the <I>Ripper.</I> Charlie only asked a small sum as rental, much
less than the amount of damages received, so that the travelers had plenty
left for other purposes.
<P>
"And now the boat is yours, as long as you stay here," said Charlie, when
the final details had been arranged. "I know you will take good care of her."
<P>
"Of course we will," answered Jerry, "and, if you find, after you get to
San Francisco, that you have a chance to come back, we'll give her up to
you."
<P>
"There's no such good luck as my coming back this season," said Charlie.
<P>
Early the next morning he brought the craft to the Seabury dock, where it
was run in the small boathouse. Then, having explained to the boys some minor
details of the engine, which was different and more powerful than the one
they were used to, Charlie took his departure, having had another letter
from his father asking him to hurry to San Francisco.
<P>
"I hope you will have a good time," said the <I>Ripper's</I> owner, as he
bade the boys and girls good-bye. "Don't get into any dangerous adventures,
especially with the girls on board."
<P>
"We'll not," promised Jerry, but he did not know how soon Charlie's warning
was to be fulfilled.
<P>
"Well, what do you girls say to a ride?" asked Jerry when Charlie had gone,
and they stood looking at the powerful boat.
<P>
"Do you think you boys can run her?" asked Nellie.
<P>
"Run her? Well, I guess we can," declared Ned.
<P>
"Didn't we tackle the Atlantic in the <I>Dartaway, </I> a smaller boat than
this?" asked Bob, "and isn't the Atlantic worse than the Pacific?"
<P>
"I don't believe it is, a bit," said Olivia. "Everyone thinks the Pacific
ocean is very peaceful, because the name indicates that. But old fishermen
here have told me there are terrible storms, which come up quite unexpectedly,
and that at times there are dreadful fogs."
<P>
"Well, we're not afraid," boasted Bob. "Are we fellows?"
<P>
"Oh, I guess we can manage to run the boat," replied Jerry, who was critically
examining the machinery. "If you girls want to go for a spin, I think I can
guarantee to get you safely back."
<P>
"Oh, we're not afraid on a day like this," replied Nellie. "There's no sign
of a storm. Come on girls."
<P>
She and her sisters got in, followed by Ned and Bob. Jerry was already in
the small cabin, set aside for the engineer. He was testing various wheels
and levers, seeing that the oil feed cups worked well, and looking to the
sparking system.
<P>
"All ready?" he asked.
<P>
"Let her go, Captain Jerry," called Bob, as he cast off the lines, and the
<I>Ripper,</I> with her new commander and crew, started off.
<P>
Jerry found he could manage the engine about as well as the one that had
been in the <I>Dartaway. </I> He soon had the motor going almost at full
speed, and the way the boat cut through the water was a revelation to the
boys. They had never ridden so fast in a motor boat before. Straight out
to sea Jerry headed the craft, and the weather was so pleasant, the water
so calm, and the sense of swift motion so enthralling, that, before they
knew it, they had gone several miles.
<P>
"Oh!" suddenly exclaimed Rose, as she came from the small cabin, and glanced
back toward the shore, "I can't see anything."
<P>
"It is a bit hazy," admitted Ned.
<P>
"Must have blown up a little fog," spoke Jerry. "I guess we'll put back.
It didn't look as it was going to be thick weather when we started."
<P>
He swung the boat around and headed for what he supposed was the shore. As
the boat speeded on the mist became thicker, until they could scarcely see
two hundred feet ahead of them.
<P>
"Better slow down; hadn't you?" suggested Bob. "We might hit something."
<P>
"Yes, for goodness, sake, don't have a collision," begged Nellie.
<P>
"We ought to be pretty near shore," remarked Jerry. "I'll keep on a little
longer, and we'll come pretty near the dock, I think."
<P>
He tried to peer ahead into the fog, but it slowly settled down in lazy,
curling wreaths, that made it as hard to see through as though a white blanket
had been hung in front of him.
<P>
"Hark! What's that'?" asked Olivia, holding up her hand.
<P>
Out of the mist there came the dismal clang of a bell.
<P>
"Dong! Ding! Dong!"
<P>
"A vessel!" cried Bob. "Look out, Jerry, or we'll be run down."
<P>
"That isn't a vessel," said Rose, with a worried look on her face. "That's
the bell of the shoal buoy. We are quite a way out to sea!"
<P>
"And lost in the fog," added Nellie.
<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<h4>ON THE ROCKS</h4>
<P>
WITH a quick motion Jerry shut off the power, and the <I>Ripper</I> drifted
through the mist, slowly losing headway. The sound of the bell became more
distinct, and in a little while something dark loomed up before the anxious
eyes of the boys and girls.
<P>
"Lookout! She's going to hit!" cried Ned.
<P>
"That's the buoy," declared Nellie.
<P>
"What's its location?" asked Jerry. "Can't we get our bearings from it?"
<P>
"Well, it's about eight miles off shore, I've heard the fishermen say," replied
Nellie, "and it's about four miles down the coast from San Felicity."
<P>
"It doesn't seem as if we came as far as that," said Bob.
<P>
"This is a very fast boat," commented Rose.
<P>
"Is the buoy anchored to rocks?" asked Ned.
<P>
"No, it's on a dangerous shoal," answered Olivia "But there is no harm from
that source to be feared to this boat, as it doesn't draw much water."
<P>
"It ought to be easy enough to start in the right direction for San Felicity,
with this buoy to guide us," suggested Bob. "Can't you, Jerry."
<P>
"I guess so, if you think it will be safe to travel in the fog."
<P>
"No, don't," urged Nellie. "I'm afraid we might have a collision. I don't
know much about this bay, and there are dangerous places in it, I've heard
the fishermen say. We had better stay here until the fog lifts."
<P>
"That's what I think," agreed Rose and Olivia.
<P>
Bob and Ned, however, were for going on, but Jerry rather sided with the
girls.
<P>
"Well," he finally said, in answer to the urging of his two chums, "Which
way would you say the dock was, Ned?"
<P>
"Off there," and Ned pointed over the port rail.
<P>
"No, you're wrong," declared Bob. "It's there," and he indicated the opposite
direction.
<P>
"There, you see," remarked Jerry. "It can't be both ways. The fog has you
puzzled, just as it has me. We should have looked at the compass when we
started out. Maybe the girls can advise us."
<P>
But they, too, were equally at loss regarding in what direction San Felicity
lay.
<P>
"We'll have to drift around a bit," decided Jerry. "It's not very pleasant,
but it's better than running any chances."
<P>
In spite of their dismal situation the boys and girls managed to extract
a good deal of fun out of their experience. They laughed, joked, told stories
and sang songs.
<P>
"Well, well!" exclaimed Jerry, looking at his watch. "Here it is noon, and
we're not home for dinner."
<P>
"No, and not likely to be," added Ned rather gloomily. "I'll admit I'm as
bad as Bob this time. I want something to eat."
<P>
"Do you?" asked the stout youth.
<P>
"Sure, Chunky."
<P>
"Then, maybe you'll quit making fun of me," was Bob's answer, as, from one
of the lockers he drew out a bulky package.
<P>
"What is it?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"Sandwiches and cake. I bought 'em in the little booth where we had chocolate
with Mr. Blowitz the other day. I thought we might be hungry, so I got 'em
while you were tinkering with the engine. Now, maybe you wish I hadn't."
<P>
"Not a bit of it, Chunky," declared Jerry heartily. "You're all right!"
<P>
"It was very thoughtful to provide for us," said Rose.
<P>
There was fresh water in a cooler, and the young people made a merry meal.
They ate everything to the last crumbs, and, as Bob said, they could probably
have gotten away with more, for the salt air gave them good appetites.
<P>
"The fog's lifting!" exclaimed Ned suddenly. "Now we can start for home.
I can just make out the coast."
<P>
True enough, right ahead of them was a low, dark line.
<P>
"Well, if that isn't queer," remarked Bob. "I would have said the shore was
off there," and he pointed in the opposite direction.
<P>
"I guess we must have turned around when we drifted," said Jerry. "We're
quite a way from the buoy now."
<P>
Once it began to lift, the fog dispersed rapidly, and Jerry soon had the
engine going, and the boat headed for the shore. He speeded the motor up
to as high a pitch as was safe, in unfamiliar waters, and soon the town of
San Felicity came into view.
<P>
"Get near the shore," advised Ned, "then, if the fog shuts down on us again,
we'll know where we are."
<P>
Jerry decided this was good advice, and steered the <I>Ripper</I> straight
in, intending to run up along the coast to San Felicity. It was well that
he did so, for the lifting of the fog was only temporary. When they were
about a quarter of a mile from the shore the white mist closed in again,
worse than before. But Jerry had his sense of direction now, and decided
it would be safe to continue on at half speed, as there did not appear to
be any other craft in sight, when he took a rapid survey of the bay just
as the fog settled down.
<P>
Peering through the almost impenetrable white mass of vapor ahead of him,
Jerry sent the <I>Ripper</I> slowly on her way.
<P>
"You'll have to be careful," cautioned Rose. "The tide is running out, and
there's not much water along here at the ebb. I hope we don't go aground."
<P>
"So do I," answered Jerry.
<P>
Just then there was a shock, and the boat quivered, hesitated for an instant,
and then resumed her course.
<P>
"We struck bottom that time," said Ned. "Luckily it seemed to be mud."
<P>
"There are rocks along here," declared Nellie. "Go slow, Jerry."
<P>
The steersman, who could manage the boat from the engine cockpit, as well
as from the bow, further slowed down the motor, until the <I>Ripper</I> was
barely moving through the water.
<P>
Suddenly there was a grinding sound, the boat heeled over to one side, and
came to a stop.
<P>
"The rocks!" cried Rose. "We're on the rocks!"
<P>
"Reverse!" yelled Ned, and Jerry did so, as quick as a flash, but it was
too late.
<P>
"We're aground," he announced grimly.
<P>
"Will we sink?" asked Olivia in alarm.
<P>
"I guess there's no danger of that," announced Jerry, as he went forward,
"but I hope we haven't stove a hole in her," he added, peering anxiously
over the side.
<P>
"How about it?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Well, it might be worse," answered Jerry. "We have run right on the cleft
of a rock, and we're held there. Can't get off until high tide, I suppose.
Say, we seem to be up against it on our first trip."
<P>
"Oh, as long as we're not sinking we're all right," said Olivia. "We can
wade ashore. It's not far."
<P>
"Yes, it's quite a way, and I don't want to spoil my shoes," objected Nellie.
"We should have brought our bathing suits. Oh, dear! Isn't it unfortunate?
I'm afraid father will be worried about us."
<P>
"One of us will wade or swim ashore, and tell him," said Ned. "We can easily
do it."
<P>
"Boat ahoy!" suddenly called a voice out of the mist. "Who are you?"
<P>
"The <I>Ripper,"</I> answered Jerry. "Who are you?"
<P>
A moment later a rowboat appeared from behind the white curtain of fog, and
the boys and girls saw. that Mr. Carson Blowitz was in the craft.
<P>
"Well! Well!" he exclaimed. "You're in trouble, aren't you?&mdash;and I'm just
in time to effect a rescue," and he smiled at the boat load of boys and girls.
<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<h4>NEWS OF THE BRIG</h4>
<P>
"OH!" exclaimed Rose, rather excitedly, "take us off please! Our boat is
sinking!"
<P>
"No, it isn't," declared Jerry. "We're all right only we're aground. Can't
get off until high tide I suppose."
<P>
"Then perhaps I had better take the young ladies ashore," proposed Mr. Blowitz.
"I have a large boat here, and they will be more comfortable than sitting
there waiting for the tide to rise. Besides, you'll heel over quite a bit,
I should judge by the way you're listing now."
<P>
There was no doubt of this, as the <I>Ripper</I> was, even now, far from
being on an even keel. The boys did not relish having this man, whom they
disliked, take off the girls, but there was no help for it.
<P>
"Say, we ought to go to some kindergarten and learn to run a motor boat,"
grumbled Ned in a low voice, as the girls were getting into Mr. Blowitz's
craft. "We're peaches, we are!"
<P>
"It was my fault," admitted Jerry, rather embarrassed over the accident.
<P>
"Not in particular," remarked Bob. "Any one of us would have done the same
thing. Lucky the boat isn't damaged any, but I hate to be under obligations
to him," and he nodded toward Mr. Blowitz, who was helping Nellie into his
boat. "I don't like him," he went on in a low voice. "There's something queer
about him."
<P>
"We oughtn't to feel that way," said Jerry. "He's doing us a favor."
<P>
"Of course," admitted Bob. "I know it, and I suppose I shouldn't feel that
way, but I do, and I can't help it. I don't want any favors from him. He's
the kind, who, if he does something for you, will want you to do twice as
much for him in return."
<P>
"Well, I'll be more careful next time I run this motor boat," said Jerry.
"It's too bad."
<P>
"Might be worse," said Ned as cheerfully as he could.
<P>
"Don't you want to go ashore, boys?" called Mr. Blowitz.
<P>
"I guess we'd better," murmured Bob. "The water is quite deep except for
the place where the <I>Ripper</I> went on the rocks."
<P>
"The motor boat will stay there all right until high tide," the man went
on. "Better anchor her well, however, it might come on to blow."
<P>
Jerry attended to this, throwing over a strong anchor which was aboard. Then
the three boys joined the others in the rowboat.
<P>
"Can you find your way to shore, through this fog?" asked Rose.
<P>
"Oh, yes, we're not far from the beach," replied Mr. Blowitz. "I've been
out to see an old fisherman, on business, and I was slowly coming back through
the fog, when I saw your boat. I didn't know you owned that."
<P>
"We don't," replied Jerry shortly, for he did not want to get too friendly
with Mr. Blowitz, even if that man did show a desire to do so. "We hired
it."
<P>
"I thought I'd seen it in the bay before," went on the man. "It's a fine
boat. I suppose you could go out quite a way to sea in her."
<P>
"You could," said Bob. "It's big enough to weather quite a gale, and you
could carry provisions enough for two weeks."
<P>
"It certainly is a fine craft," went on Mr. Blowitz, as if he was thinking
of something. "A fine craft."
<P>
"Did you ever hear anything more of your brig, the <I>Rockhaven?"</I> asked
Nellie.
<P>
"Yes, I did," was the unexpected answer. "In fact that was why I went out
rowing to-day. I had a telegram from the captain of the brig last night.
It seems she did not sink as at first supposed, but is a derelict, drifting
about somewhere off this coast."
<P>
"Has any one seen her?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Yes, the captain of a fishing smack. He was the man I went to interview
to-day. He says as he was cruising along, day before yesterday, he sighted
what he took to be a small boat. When he got closer he saw it was an abandoned
brig. From his description I knew it was the one I was interested in."
<P>
"But if you only got a telegram from the captain of the brig last night,
telling you it had not sunk, how did you know the fishing smack captain had
sighted her, and how did you go out to see him to-day?" asked Jerry, for
he thought there was something queer in the story Mr. Blowitz told, while
the man's manner did not favorably impress him.
<P>
"Oh, that," and Mr. Blowitz glanced sharply at Jerry, and then resumed his
rowing toward shore. The fog had lifted a bit, and the beach could be made
out. "Well, that was rather queer," admitted the man, slowly, as if searching
about for a good answer. "You see I didn't know the fishing captain had seen
the derelict. When I got the telegram, telling me the brig was still afloat,
I thought it might be a good plan to go about among the fishermen, making
inquiries."
<P>
"And you happened to strike the right one?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"I&mdash;that is&mdash;well, I had inquired among several before I met Captain Deckton
of the smack <I>Sea Girl.</I> He saw the derelict. But I'd like to have a
talk with you boys, when you are at liberty," added Mr. Blowitz, quickly.
"I have a proposition to make to you. I think you will be interested."
<P>
"Please put us ashore first, before you talk business," begged Olivia. "It
is long past noon, and I'm afraid my father will be worried about us."
<P>
"We'll land at the dock in ten minutes," said Mr. Blowitz. "I'll talk to
the boys later."
<P>
"I wonder what he wants?" thought Jerry. "Something of a favor, I'll bet.
I know his kind."
<P>
"Let me take the oars and relieve you," proposed Ned, who saw that the man
was having rather hard work with the boatload of young people.
<P>
"Thank you, there's another pair in the stern, if you want to try them,"
said Mr. Blowitz, and Ned got them out. They made better time after that,
and were soon at the dock.
<P>
"We must hurry home," said Rose.
<P>
"Perhaps you boys had rather talk with me later," suggested Mr. Blowitz.
"There is no special hurry. Some time this afternoon will do as well, and
you might like to go home with the young ladies."
<P>
"I guess it would be better," decided Jerry. "Where shall we see you?"
<P>
"If you will call at the refreshment booth here about five o'clock this evening,
I'll be taking my usual afternoon drink of chocolate there, and I'll be pleased
to have you join me."
<P>
"We will be here," promised Jerry, as, with his chums, he followed the girls
along the dock and toward the bungalow.
<P>
"Why didn't you ask him what he wanted?" inquired Ned, when they were beyond
hearing distance.
<P>
"Because, I want a chance to think some matters over," replied Jerry. "I
believe Mr. Blowitz is up to some game, and I want to see if I can't discover
what it is."
<P>
"It seems a mean thing to say," added Rose, "but I don't like that man, in
spite of the fact that he has been kind to us. I'm sure we ought to appreciate
what he did for us to-day, in saving us a wetting, but I can't feel that
he is sincere."
<P>
"I, either," admitted Olivia and Nellie, while the latter added:
<P>
"I hope you boys don't go into any business dealings with him. Perhaps you
had better consult with my father, before you do."
<P>
"I guess it would be a good plan," said Jerry. "I hope Mr. Seabury will not
be angry at us for taking you out and getting fog-bound, as well as involving
you in a shipwreck."
<P>
"Oh, no!" answered Rose with a laugh. "He knows we are all right, for we
have been on the water, more or less, all our lives. He sometimes worries
a little, but, when we get home safe, he's so glad to see us that he never
scolds." Nor did he this time. He inquired about the trip, and expressed
his regrets at the mishap to the <I>Ripper. </I>
<P>
"It will be all right if we don't get a storm before high tide," he said.
"I'll inquire of Ponto what the weather signs are. Ponto! I say Ponto! Where
are you?"
<P>
"Comin' Massa Seabury! I'se comin'," answered a sleepy voice and Ponto came
from the garden to the veranda, where Mr. Seabury, his daughters and the
boys were.
<P>
"Do you think we are going to have a storm?"
<P>
"Storm? No, sah. No storm to-day."
<P>
"How can you tell?"
<P>
"Easy, Massa Seabury. When it's goin' t' storm, I cain't never sleep well,
an' now, I can fall asleep as easy as a baby."
<P>
"I believe you. Well, that's what I wanted to know. He's a very good weather
prophet," he added in a low voice to the boys. "I guess the boat is safe.
Have you seen Professor Snodgrass lately, Ponto?"
<P>
"Yais, sah, I done saw him 'bout half an hour ago. He were huntin' around
de' lower end ob de garden, after some web-footed grasshoppers, I t'ink he
said."
<P>
"Web-footed lizards," corrected Ned.
<P>
"Yais, sah, dat's what it were. Web-footed lizards an' horned toads. Golly,
I hopes he don't cotch none when I'se around!"
<P>
The boys told Mr. Seabury of Mr. Blowitz, and their host advised them to
be careful about entering into any arrangement with the man.
<P>
"I don't know him," he said, "but I have heard from different persons here
that there is something queer about him. However, he may only want some favor
that you can easily do."
<P>
Shortly before five o'clock the three boys started to keep their appointment
with Carson Blowitz. Professor Snodgrass had not succeeded in finding any
horned toads, and announced his intention of making a search near the bed
of a dried-up river that evening, as he had heard there were some there.
The girls were too tired to care for further excursions that afternoon, and
they remained on the shady veranda, as the boys started off.
<P>
"I wonder what Blowitz can want?" mused Ned, as he and his chums neared the
chocolate pavilion.
<P>
"We'll soon know," said Jerry.
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<h4>WHAT MR. BLOWITZ WANTED</h4>
<P>
THE boys found Mr. Carson Blowitz in the little courtyard of the pavilion,
calmly sipping some cold chocolate.
<P>
"Ah, you are right on time, I see," he remarked, as pleasantly as he could.
"That's what I like, boys. It shows your American spirit. Bright, hustling
lads, all of you. Just the kind I have been looking for."
<P>
"Did you want to see us on business?" asked Jerry, for he did not care for
the man's too obvious flattery.
<P>
"Yes, I did, but first let me order some chocolate for you. It is a hot day
and you'll feel better after it. I never talk business unless I am eating,
or drinking something like chocolate or lemonade. It calms the nerves."
<P>
Jerry was about to refuse, as he wanted to get the interview over with as
soon as possible, but he looked at Bob, and that youth showed an evident
desire to have some refreshment.
<P>
"Well, we'll take a little," Jerry said.
<P>
"I thought so. Here!" and he clapped his hands to summon the waitress, who
soon returned with some cups of cold chocolate.
<P>
"Now to business," went on Mr. Blowitz, after a pause. "Did I understand
you to say you had hired that large motor boat?"
<P>
"We have; for several weeks," answered Jerry, who, by consent of Ned and
Bob, had been elected spokesman.
<P>
"And do you think it could go to sea&mdash;say for a couple of weeks?"
<P>
"Yes, I think so. But did you think of hiring her from us? Because if you
did I don't believe we can consider it, as we have no authority to let any
one but ourselves run it."
<P>
"Oh, no, I was not thinking of running it," declared Mr. Blowitz. "I wouldn't
know how if I wanted to. But I was thinking I might engage the motor boat
and you with it, as a crew, to go on a cruise for me."
<P>
"A cruise?"
<P>
"Yes, out on the Pacific, but not too far from shore, say not more than twenty
miles."
<P>
"What for?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"To search for that derelict&mdash;the brig <I>Rockhaven!"</I>
<P>
"The <I>Rockhaven!"</I> exclaimed Ned and Bob together.
<P>
"Yes, as I told you it has a valuable cargo aboard, and, in addition a supply
of gold, in money, and some important papers."
<P>
"Do you think we could find her?" asked Ned.
<P>
"I think so," answered Mr. Blowitz. "I made some particular inquiries of
the captain of the fishing smack, whom I saw to-day, and I got her longitude
and latitude, as near as he could give it to me. Of course it would be a
rather hard search, and might consume considerable time, but I would be willing
to pay for that. What I want to know is, if you boys would care to go out
in that boat, the <I>Ripper, </I> and search for the derelict? If you find
her I will pay you prize money."
<P>
"If we found her, and she was quite a way out to sea, how would we get her
in?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"You could tow her, unless there was a bad storm. That motor boat is very
powerful."
<P>
"Then there isn't anyone on board now?" asked Bob.
<P>
"Not a living soul," answered the man. "It's queer how they came to desert
her, but I guess the captain and crew got scared and went off in a hurry,
without making a proper investigation. The brig is a small one, and if she
hit on a rock, or was in a collision, it would not take much to knock her
out.
<P>
"Now here is my proposition. You are to take the <I>Ripper, </I> get her
in good shape for the cruise, and start out. The sooner the better. I will
pay all expenses, such as for provisions and supplies. If you return with
the brig I will pay you two thousand dollars. If you don't succeed in finding
her, after say a two weeks' search, you are to return, and I will pay you
five hundred dollars, and all expenses. What do you say?"
<P>
"That sounds good to me," replied Bob.
<P>
"Suppose we got the vessel, made fast to her, and started to tow her in and
had to abandon her because of a storm?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"Well, of course that might happen, though it's not likely, for we seldom
have bad storms an this coast this time of year. Still if you couldn't bring
the derelict in, you couldn't that's all. But if you found her, you could
get the papers and gold, and if you had to abandon her, you could go back
after the storm was over. I think you boys could do what I want, and, as
I say, I'm willing to pay well. I'd go with you, of course. What do you say?"
<P>
Mr. Blowitz seemed quite anxious. In fact he was so anxious that Jerry was
suspicious.
<P>
"I wonder why he doesn't hire some larger boat, or a small steam tug to go
for that derelict?" thought Jerry. "He could get men, who are regularly engaged
in the business of saving vessels, to go out for that price. Why should he
prefer us, when we have had no experience in that line, and hardly know him?
There is something back of all this, that he is not telling us. I wonder
what we had better do?"
<P>
"Well?" asked Mr. Blowitz, as none of the boys spoke. Ned and Bob were waiting
for Jerry to reply and the latter was turning it over in his mind, seeking
to find a reason for the strange request.
<P>
"When would we have to start?" asked Jerry, at. last.
<P>
"I'd like you to go to-morrow, or the day after, at the farthest. It would
not take long to provision the boat for the cruise."
<P>
"Will you put your offer in writing?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"In writing&mdash;why, isn't my word good? Well, of course&mdash;Oh, I see&mdash;you think
I am a stranger here and might&mdash;Oh, well, I have no objection to drawing
up an agreement. Perhaps that will be the best way."
<P>
Mr. Blowitz looked a little annoyed that Jerry should have suggested such
a thing, but he quickly covered his confusion by speaking rapidly.
<P>
"I'll draw up a paper right away," he said, taking a fountain pen from his
pocket. "I'll have the waitress get me some blanks, and you can have them
witnessed before a notary public, if you wish."
<P>
"There's no hurry," said Jerry. "Suppose you draw up the papers, and we can
meet you here to-morrow to talk things over further. I think we should take
a little time to consider this. It is rather a queer proposition&mdash;"
<P>
"Oh, of course, I don't want to hurry you into it," declared Mr. Blowitz,
in rather a nervous manner. "Of course I could get some other boat and a
regular crew, but I saw you boys, and I took a liking to you. I thought you
might like to earn some money and, if you have good luck, it oughtn't to
be hard work."
<P>
"Oh, we'd like the money all right enough," interposed Bob.
<P>
"We'll think it over," put in Jerry quickly, for he was afraid Ned or Bob
might say something that would commit them. "We'll meet you here to-morrow
at ten o'clock and you can have the papers with you."
<P>
"All right," agreed the man, and Jerry thought he seemed disappointed that
the matter was not settled at once. "Don't forget now," he urged them, as
they left the pavilion, Mr. Blowitz remaining there to drink more chocolate.
<P>
"Why didn't you agree to it, Jerry?" asked Bob, when they were outside. "That
would be a swell cruise. Just the thing! And think of getting two thousand
dollars!"
<P>
"That's just it," replied Jerry. "We want time to think it over, and I guess
we had better tell Mr. Seabury. Boys, I believe there is something wrong
back of all this, and we don't want to run into danger."
<P>
"Danger!" exclaimed Ned. "Do you think there is danger?"
<P>
"I don't know, but I'm going to be on the safe side. I don't like Mr. Blowitz,
but he may be all right. If we find he is, and Mr. Seabury advises it, we'll
go on that cruise, and try to find the derelict. I asked him to make out
the papers so we could have a chance to consider it."
<P>
"Well, maybe you're right," admitted Ned. "But I do hope it's all right.
It would be great, to take a voyage on the Pacific in the <I>Ripper."</I>
<P>
The boys hurried back to the bungalow, intending to tell Mr. Seabury the
result of their talk with Mr. Blowitz before mentioning it to the girls.
<P>
"Father has gone out," said Rose. "He has gone to dine with a friend, and
he'll not be back until late to-night. We'll have supper together, and go
for a trip on the bay. It's going to be a nice moonlight night."
<P>
"The very thing!" exclaimed Ned. "But we must see to the <I>Ripper. </I>
She's on the rocks yet."
<P>
"That's so," exclaimed Jerry. "I nearly forgot about her. Bob and I will
get her and take her to the dock. She must be afloat by now."
<P>
"It's almost supper-time," said Nellie, "hurry back."
<P>
"Oh&mdash;it's near supper-time, is it?" asked Bob, with a woe-begone look on
his face. "I&mdash;er&mdash;"
<P>
"Come on, Ned," called Jerry. "Bob's afraid he'll get left on the eating
proposition. You come with me."
<P>
Ned and Jerry rowed out to the motor boat. They found her floated, and riding
easily, and, after towing her to the dock, they returned to the house. Partaking
of a hasty supper the young folks, leaving Ponto and the servant in the bungalow,
went down to the beach, and started for a moonlight ride in the <I>Ripper.
</I>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<h4>A CRY FOR HELP</h4>
<P>
"ISN'T this perfectly delightful," remarked Nellie, as she reclined on some
cushions in the little cabin. "I just love to be on the water!"
<P>
"Well, it's better than being out in the fog," admitted Jerry, as he adjusted
the oil feed on the engine, and glanced over the moonlit waves.
<P>
"There don't seem to be many boats out tonight," observed Olivia.
<P>
"Maybe the owners are afraid of a storm," suggested Rose. "Sometimes a storm
will follow a fog. I wonder if it's safe for us to go out?"
<P>
"We're not going far, and we'll keep near shore," replied Jerry. "It does
act as if it was going to blow a bit, but I guess it will not amount to much."
<P>
There was quite a swell on as they got further out, and the <I>Ripper</I>
rolled some, but the boys and girls were too good sailors to mind that.
<P>
"I wonder if we'll meet Mr. Blowitz again," came from Nellie, after a period
of silence. "He's always turning up most unexpectedly."
<P>
"I don't believe we'll see him to-night," said Ned. "What do you think he
wanted of us? Shall I tell 'em, Jerry?"
<P>
"Might as well, I'm going to tell Mr. Seabury as soon as I see him."
<P>
Thereupon Ned related the interview with Carson Blowitz, and the latter's
desire to have the boys search for the derelict <I>Rockhaven. </I>
<P>
"I hope you don't go," spoke Nellie.
<P>
"Why not?" asked Bob.
<P>
"Because&mdash;well, because," and she laughed a little uneasily.
<P>
"That's just like a girl," remarked Jerry, good-naturedly. "They don't want
you to do a thing, but they can't tell you why."
<P>
"Well, it's just an uneasy feeling I have toward Mr. Blowitz, that's all,"
went on Nellie. "I can't explain it, but I feel, whenever I am near him,
that he is planning something mean, or that he is up to some trick."
<P>
"Well, it's just how I feel," declared Rose, and Olivia admitted that she,
too, did not trust the man.
<P>
"Well, we haven't decided to go," said Jerry, "and we're going to have a
talk with your father about it. I admit I'd like to make the trip and find
the brig, but, as you say, I don't quite trust Blowitz."
<P>
"Oh!" suddenly exclaimed Rose, as a wave, larger than any that had preceded
it, sent a shower of spray over the boat. "Don't go out any farther, Jerry.
It's getting quite rough."
<P>
"Yes, I guess it is," admitted the steersman, as he put the boat about. "There's
quite a swell on. Wouldn't wonder but we'd have a storm by morning, though
it's bright enough overhead. I don't believe Ponto is a good prophet."
<P>
There were only a few clouds in the sky, and the moon was shining down like
a big silver disk, making objects unusually bright, for the southern moonlight
is wonderful.
<P>
Jerry put the boat over near shore, and steered along the coast, which, at
that point was quite rocky, cliffs rising here and there to a considerable
height above the water.
<P>
"Look out you don't run her on the rocks again," cautioned Ned.
<P>
"I'll be careful," replied Jerry. "Maybe you want to run her a while. I don't
want to be the whole show."
<P>
Ned was glad of the chance to take the wheel, and he and Jerry changed places.
They were proceeding at slow speed, the girls occasionally humming the chorus
of a song, and the boys joining in when they knew the air. The beauty of
the night, the fine boat, and delight of moving along with scarcely a sound,
had them all under a sort of magic spell, and they felt they could thus go
on forever.
<P>
It was when they came opposite a range of low cliffs, close to the water's
edge, that Bob suddenly called out in a low voice:
<P>
"Look at the men on the rocks!"
<P>
"Where?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"Over there," and Bob pointed. Ned steered the boat nearer to where two black
figures, sharply outlined in the moonlight, could be seen in bold relief
on the cliff.
<P>
"They are men, sure enough," replied Jerry, "but you needn't get excited
over it."
<P>
"I'm not," went on Bob. "Only one of them is Mr. Blowitz, that's all."
<P>
"Mr. Blowitz?" queried Jerry sharply.
<P>
"Hush! He'll hear you," cautioned Rose. "Sounds carry very easily over water."
<P>
"It is Mr. Blowitz," admitted Jerry. "I wonder what he's doing out here."
<P>
"Probably getting some more information about the brig <I>Rockhaven,"</I>
suggested Ned. "Maybe that's a seaman who has some news of her."
<P>
By this time the motor boat was quite close to the two men, who, however,
did not seem to notice the <I>Ripper. </I> There was no question about the
identity of Mr. Blowitz. The other man was a stranger to the boys and girls.
The two were apparently talking earnestly, and, occasionally Mr. Blowitz
could be seen to be gesticulating violently.
<P>
"He's mad about something," declared Ned.
<P>
"It does look so," agreed Rose.
<P>
All at once the boys saw Blowitz take a step toward the other man, who retreated,
as if afraid. Blowitz raised his hand as though to give a blow.
<P>
"Look out!" cried Ned involuntarily, as if the man could hear him. "You'll
go over the cliff!"
<P>
With a quick motion he turned the boat, steering toward the foot of the rock,
above which the men stood.
<P>
At that instant a black cloud came over the moon and the scene was plunged
in darkness. It was just as if it had been blotted out, and a murmur of surprise,
at the suddenness of it, came from those in the <I>Ripper. </I>
<P>
At the same instant a cry rang out&mdash;a man's cry&mdash;and it seemed to be one
for help.
<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>
<h4>BLOWITZ IS ANGRY</h4>
<P>
"QUICK!" called Jerry. "Put us over there, Ned!"
<P>
"I will! Something has happened. I wonder&mdash;"
<P>
"Oh, why doesn't the moon come out from behind that cloud," exclaimed Rose,
for she and the other girls were nervously afraid.
<P>
"Maybe they have both toppled over the cliff," suggested Nellie.
<P>
"More likely only one of them did," said Bob. "I only heard one cry. What's
the matter, Ned?"
<P>
"Something's gone wrong with the engine."
<P>
"Here, let me have a look," called Jerry, and he went to the cockpit.
<P>
There was a lantern aboard, and, by the light of it, Jerry saw that one of
the battery wires, leading to a spark plug, had become loosened, breaking
the circuit, and preventing the gas from exploding in the cylinders. He soon
had it fixed and the engine started, sending the boat toward shore.
<P>
By this time the moon was out again, flooding the scene with radiance. Eagerly
the boys and girls looked toward the spot on the cliffs, where the odd scene
had taken place. To their surprise they saw Mr. Blowitz standing there, and
they were close enough to note that he was smoking a cigar.
<P>
"Well!" exclaimed Nellie, for that was all she could say, so great was her
astonishment.
<P>
"Guess nothing happened after all," added Ned. "We have had our fright for
nothing."
<P>
"There certainly was another man there," declared Jerry, "and he's gone now."
<P>
"And I'm certain I heard a cry for help," said Bob.
<P>
"We all heard a cry," admitted Jerry, "but it might have been a call for
a boatman, or something like that. However&mdash;"
<P>
He did not finish what he was going to say for, at that instant, Blowitz
heard the noise of the approaching motor boat. The muffler. was not working
just right, and the usually noiseless engine of the <I>Ripper</I> was making
quite a fuss. Blowitz was in a listening attitude, standing in bold relief
in the moonlight, and, having, apparently, satisfied himself as to where
the boat was, he started to descend the cliff.
<P>
"He's coming down," said Ned.
<P>
"Is that the <I>Ripper?"</I> called Blowitz suddenly.
<P>
"Yes," replied Jerry, wondering how the man knew.
<P>
"I thought I recognized her engine. Are you coming ashore? If you are, I'd
like to speak to you."
<P>
"We're coming," answered Ned.
<P>
"Don't come too close then, for there are dangerous rocks. Make for that
little point up there," and the man pointed so that the boys could see where
he meant. "There's deep water right up to the edge. It's a sort of natural
dock, but go slow. I'll meet you there, I want to tell you something."
<P>
"Shall we ask him about the man?" inquired Bob in a low voice.
<P>
"No, don't," advised Nellie quickly. "It might make trouble. See what he
has to say, and then let's hurry home. I'm afraid of him."
<P>
"What? With we three aboard?" asked Jerry with a little laugh. "We are
complimented."
<P>
"Oh, I don't mean that," Nellie hastened to say. "I mean that Mr. Blowitz
is a dangerous man."
<P>
She spoke low for she did not want him to hear her, and they were quite near
to shore now.
<P>
Ned steered for the little point of land, and found he could send the boat
quite close with no danger of hitting the rocks. Presently Blowitz, who had
momentarily vanished amid the shadows at the foot of the cliff, appeared.
<P>
"Good evening, boys," he said. "I&mdash;" he stopped suddenly, "I didn't know
you had young ladies aboard."
<P>
"Yes, we have been taking a moonlight run," Jerry explained. "We saw you
up there on the cliff, and&mdash;"
<P>
"I was there with a friend of mine," Blowitz spoke quickly. "We were talking
about the derelict brig. I was to meet a sea captain there, but he did not
come. My friend had to leave in a hurry, and just then I heard the noise
made by your boat, so I called to you. Did you hear a call?"
<P>
"We heard some sort of a call," spoke up Bob, "but we thought it was&mdash;"
<P>
"That was me," interrupted Blowitz, "I recognized the <I>Ripper</I> by the
peculiar sound of the exhaust. I have quite a trick of recognizing boats
that way. I was afraid you'd get past, so I called. But I didn't know you
had the young ladies with you, or I would not have bothered you."
<P>
"That's all right," said Jerry. "We were coming ashore anyhow."
<P>
"You were? What for?" and Blowitz looked sharply at the boys. "Oh, I suppose
you saw me and wanted to tell me you would accept my offer&mdash;but excuse me,
perhaps the young ladies&mdash;"
<P>
"Oh, we have told them of it," answered Ned. "You can speak before them."
<P>
"All right then. I was going to say perhaps you came in after seeing me,
to tell me you had accepted my offer and would search for the derelict. Is
that it?"
<P>
"Well, we hadn't quite decided," replied Jerry.
<P>
"What! Not decided!" exclaimed Blowitz. "Why I want you to start at
once&mdash;or&mdash;that is&mdash;to-morrow morning. I have just received news that makes
it important that the search begin at once. I am depending on you. You will
go at once, won't you? Come, I'll increase my offer," he said. "I'll pay
you two thousand dollars for your time and trouble, stand all expenses, and,
if you find the brig, and tow her in, I'll give you three thousand dollars.
That's a fair offer. Now you can start to-morrow morning, can't you, boys?"
<P>
"I don't know," began Jerry, slowly.
<P>
"Isn't that money enough?" and Blowitz seemed much excited.
<P>
"Oh, yes, the offer is a very good one. But I think we should consult with
some one&mdash;We&mdash;"
<P>
"No, there is no need of consulting with any one," interrupted Blowitz. "I
have the papers all made out. We can go before a notary-public to-night,
for it is not late yet, and sign them, and you can start by to-morrow noon.
What do you say? Will you go?"
<P>
It was a hard question to decide. The trip was alluring to the boys, even
had there been no prize money connected with it. But there was something
about Blowitz that made them hesitate. His very eagerness to have them start,
almost at once, made them feel there was something queer back of it all.
Still they had undertaken, before this, more difficult and risky tasks. Why
not this one?
<P>
"Well, I must have your answer soon," said Blowitz, approaching nearer to
the boat.
<P>
"Will you wait just a moment?" asked Jerry. "My chums and I will go in the
cabin and talk it over. We'll let you know right away."
<P>
"I'll wait five minutes," said the man. "Time is precious to me. I have lots
to do. But I know you'll go. I'll raise the offer five hundred dollars. Now,
that's the best I can do. But you must start as soon as possible to-morrow."
<P>
"Come in here," called Jerry to his chums, entering the small cabin, where
the three girls had already gone as they did not wish to seem to listen to
the talk between Blowitz and the boys.
<P>
Jerry closed the sliding doors, and, by the light of a small lantern which
hung from the cabin ceiling, looked at his companions. Outside they could
hear Blowitz pacing up and down on the rocky shore.
<P>
"Well, what do you fellows say?" he asked.
<P>
"I'd like the trip," said Ned, wistfully.
<P>
"The money is a large sum," added Bob.
<P>
"Then you want to go?" asked Jerry. "I'll do just what ever you do. I'll
tell him we'll go."
<P>
"No! Don't!" cried Nellie in a tense whisper. "Jerry&mdash;boys&mdash;don't have anything
to do with this man. He may be all right, but there's something mysterious
about him. Why should he want to hire you when, for the same money, or less,
he could get a company of fishermen, who know these waters well, to make
the search? Take a girl's reason, for once, and don't have anything to do
with him!"
<P>
She had risen to her feet, her eyes were flashing and her cheeks flushed
with the excitement of the moment. The boys looked at her in admiration.
<P>
"I admit there is something queer in his offering to increase the prize money,"
spoke Jerry, after a pause. "He must be very desperate."
<P>
"And why this sudden rush?" inquired Ned. "This afternoon he was in no such
hurry. Something must have occurred in the meanwhile&mdash;I wonder if it was
the man on the cliff&mdash;"
<P>
"Now don't let's go to guessing at too much," cautioned Jerry. "The question
to be settled now is: Do you want to go on a search for the derelict brig?
Yes or no? That's what we've got to settle now."
<P>
There was silence for a moment, broken only by the tick of the clock in the
cabin. Involuntarily Nellie glanced at it. The hands pointed to the hour
of nine, and she felt that she and her sisters should be home. Jerry looked
at his two companions.
<P>
"I guess we'd better not go," said Bob slowly.
<P>
"I hate to give it up, but maybe it will be for the best," added Ned. "I'm
suspicious of him. Tell him we'll not go, Jerry."
<P>
"Very well."
<P>
Jerry stepped to the cabin door and slid it back. At the sound Blowitz came
eagerly forward.
<P>
"Well?" he queried. "Are you going? Can you start at once'?"
<P>
"We have decided not to go," replied Jerry, slowly. "I&mdash;that is my chums
and I&mdash;do not feel just right about it. It is not our boat, and&mdash;"
<P>
He hesitated, for he did not want to give the main reasons that had influenced
him and his chums. But Blowitz did not give him a chance to continue.
<P>
"Not go!" the man fairly cried. "Why I'm surprised at you! You led me to
believe, all along, that you would go. Here I've gone and wasted a lot of
time on you, gone to a lot of trouble, made all my arrangements, expecting
you would go, and&mdash;"
<P>
"We never gave you any reason to think we would go," declared Jerry very
positively. "You are wrong, there, Mr. Blowitz. We only said we would consider
it. We have done so, and have concluded not to go. I am sorry&mdash;"
<P>
"Sorry? You'll be sorrier than this before I'm through with you!" threatened
the man. "You'll wish you had gone before very long, let me tell you. You've
spoiled all my plans. I depended&mdash;Oh! I'll get even with you for this!" and
the man, in a fury threw his cigar down on the rocks, whence it bounded up
amid a shower of sparks. "You'll regret this!" he cried in angry tones, as
he turned away and started off up the cliff, muttering to himself.
<P>
"You've made him mad," said Bob.
<P>
"Can't help it," replied Jerry. "I'm glad we are not going to have anything
to do with him. I believe he is a dangerous person. Certainly he had no right
to talk about us as he did."
<P>
"Oh, I'm so glad you're not going!" exclaimed Nellie, as she and her sisters
came out of the cabin. "I was afraid you would give in when he got so angry.
But let's get away from here. Somehow, I don't like this place. Besides we
should have been home some time ago. Papa may have returned, and we always
try to be in before ten o'clock. We'll hardly get home by that time now."
<P>
"Yes, we will," said Ned. "I'll send the <I>Ripper</I> along at a good clip."
<P>
He started the engine, and, as the boat swung out from beside the rock dock,
the form of Blowitz could be seen going up the cliff in the moonlight. In
less than an hour the boat was at San Felicity and the girls were put ashore.
They found Ponto down at the dock to meet them.
<P>
"Massa Seabury done got worried after he got home," said the colored man,
"an' he sent me to see if yo' was heah."
<P>
"Ponto," asked Jerry, "do you think you can take the young ladies safely
home, without falling asleep?"
<P>
"Suttinly I can," Massa Jerry. "Fall asleep! I gess I doan't fall asleep
at night. I'se only sleepy when de sun shines, I is."
<P>
"Then I guess you'll do all right. See that they get home safe."
<P>
"Why, aren't you boys coming too?" asked Nellie, in some surprise.
<P>
"Not now," replied Jerry.
<P>
"Why not?"
<P>
"I think we'll go back to the foot of the cliffs and see if we can't find
the man to whom Blowitz was talking. I don't like the way he acted, for that
certainly was a cry for help, and there may have been foul play!"
<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>
<h4>THE MAN ON THE ROCKS</h4>
<P>
JERRY'S announcement was news to his chums, for he had given them no hint
of his intentions as the <I>Ripper</I> was nearing the boathouse.
<P>
"Do you mean you are going to hunt for that man on the rocks?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Yes, I think he fell; or was pushed over by Blowitz. There was no mistaking
that call for help. Blowitz says it was he who called to us, but I know better.
That was a cry of fear."
<P>
"Oh, don't get into any danger," cautioned Nellie. "Maybe you had better
take Ponto with you. We're not afraid to go home alone. It's nice and bright,
and there is no danger."
<P>
"Deed an' there be, Miss Nellie," interrupted Ponto, who did not relish going
off on a strange hunt with the boys. "Some ob dem horned toads might git
after yo', an' if Ponto wasn't along dey'd bite you. I shorely am gwine home
wid yo'. Massa Seabury, he done 'specially stipulate it, an&mdash;"
<P>
"Yes, I guess Ponto had better go with you," said Jerry. "We can do better
alone. It won't be the first time we've had a midnight hunt, though never
before one just like this. We'll come back as soon as we can, and tell you
all about it. We can make quick time in the boat."
<P>
"And, if you find the man?" asked Rose.
<P>
"If we do, and he needs help, we'll see that he gets it; I think if we do
find him we'll learn more about Mr. Carson Blowitz than we know now."
<P>
"Shall I tell my father?" asked Nellie, as the boys were preparing to make
the return trip. The dock was deserted, save for the young people and Ponto,
but in the chocolate refreshment place, and other booths on shore there was
plenty of life.
<P>
"I think it would be a good plan," agreed Jerry. "You know the whole story,
about the brig and the offer Blowitz made. Tell Mr. Seabury that we would
have consulted him before, only he was out when we got back this afternoon.
Now, Ponto, lookout that no horned toads or web-footed lizards get the young
ladies, and, above all, don't lie down alongside the road and take a nap."
<P>
"Hu! Guess I ain't gwine t' sleep when I's 'scortin my massa's daughters
home," declared the colored man, rather indignant that such a slur should
be cast on him.
<P>
"Don't worry," called Jerry, as the girls walked along the dock to shore.
"We'll be back as soon as we can."
<P>
"Do you really think we'll find anything?" asked Ned of Jerry when they were
some distance out, and speeding along toward where they had seen Blowitz
and the other man on the cliff.
<P>
"I don't know," Jerry frankly admitted. "It looks suspicious, and the way
Blowitz acted made it more so. Maybe the shadows deceived us, and the man
did not fall, for the cloud over the moon made things black. But it will
do no harm to take a look, and then we'll be satisfied."
<P>
"If we find him, what will we do with him?" asked Bob, who had a habit of
looking ahead.
<P>
"Let's find him first," said Jerry. "Maybe it is some man who works for Blowitz,
and who would not do just as his boss wanted him to. Blowitz can get angry
very easily, as was proved by his actions when we refused to make that trip.
Maybe he hit the man in a fit of passion, and the man cried out in surprise,
and ran away."
<P>
The sky was more cloudy now, and the moon was oftener obscured by masses
of dark vapor. Still, there was light enough for the boys to make out landmarks,
and distinguish objects when they came near the low cliff, on which they
had seen Blowitz and the other man.
<P>
"There's the place," called Ned suddenly, from his position near the wheel.
<P>
"That's right," admitted Jerry. "Better put us in near that rock where we
talked to Blowitz. We can fasten the boat there and go ashore. There's no
swell in here."
<P>
In a short time the three boys were on the rocky shore. Jerry carried a lantern
and Ned had a coil of rope, as he thought if the man had fallen over a cliff,
and was unable to help himself, they might need a line to hoist him up.
<P>
"Go easy now," cautioned Jerry, as they moved forward. "We don't want to
send out notice that we have arrived. Blowitz may still be sneaking around."
<P>
As cautiously as possible they advanced. They found there was a rough path
leading from the beach up the cliff, on top of which the two men had stood.
With Jerry, holding the lantern to guide them, Ned and Bob followed. They
paused now and then to listen, but the only sound they heard was caused by
the waves of the Pacific breaking on the rocky shore, the rattle of the pebbles
on the beach, and the soft swish of the seaweed.
<P>
"It was right over there that he seemed to fall," said Ned, pointing to indicate
where he meant.
<P>
"That's where I made it out to be," agreed Jerry.
<P>
It was not easy walking, as the rocks were slippery, and some of them were
thick with weeds, for, at very high water, they, were covered by the ocean.
Several times Bob slipped and nearly fell.
<P>
"Look out," cautioned Jerry. "We don't want two wounded persons to look after."
<P>
They paused a moment to get their breath, after a stiff bit of climbing,
and, as they stood there in the silence of the night, with the moon fitfully
showing through the clouds, they suddenly heard a groan.
<P>
"What's that?" whispered Ned, tensely.
<P>
"It must be the man we're looking for," replied Jerry. "He's hurt. Where
did the sound come from?"
<P>
Ned pointed to a dark spot at the foot of the cliff. The three boys hastened
toward it, Jerry flashing his lantern.
<P>
When they got to the place they saw, lying huddled up on a bed of seaweed,
the form of a man.
<P>
As the light flashed on him they noticed that there was blood on his pale
face, and one arm was doubled up under him in a strange manner.
<P>
"He's dead!" whispered Bob softly,
<P>
"No; he's breathing," answered Jerry, as he bent over the man on the rocks.
"Get me some water in your cap, Ned. I'll try to bring him to."
<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<h4>DE VERE'S STORY</h4>
<P>
NED ran down to the shore, slipping and stumbling over the rocks, and once
falling and bruising himself considerably. But he did not mind this. He wanted
to get the water, for it might save the man's life. It looked as if some
crime had been attempted, and evidence pointed to Blowitz.
<P>
Making as quick progress on the return trip as the carrying of a cap full
of sea water would permit, Ned held it so Jerry could sprinkle some drops
on the man's face. He stirred and seemed to be murmuring something.
<P>
"We ought to have some fresh water for him to drink," said Bob. "I'll get
some from the cooler on the boat."
<P>
Off he hurried, returning presently with a pitcherful of fresh water and
a glass, and with this the man was given a drink, when Jerry held up his
head.
<P>
The water seemed the very thing needed for the sufferer, as they could see
by the light of the lantern, opened his eyes, and gazed wonderingly about
him.
<P>
"What&mdash;where am I?" he asked, in a hoarse whisper.
<P>
"You're at the foot of the rocks&mdash;on the cliff near the ocean," said Jerry.
"You had a fall. Are you badly hurt?"
<P>
The man groaned in reply. Then an angry, light shone in his eyes.
<P>
"No! I didn't fall!" he exclaimed. "I was shoved over the cliff. He wanted
to get me out of the way so he could claim everything! He's a villain!"
<P>
"Who?" asked Ned quickly.
<P>
"Who? Who else but Carson Blowitz! I suppose he thinks I am dead, and he
can have all that is on the ship! But I'll&mdash;"
<P>
The man stopped suddenly, and a spasm of pain passed over his face.
<P>
"What is it?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"My arm&mdash;Oh, I'm afraid it is broken!"
<P>
The boys remembered how the left arm of the man was doubled up under him
in a peculiar manner. He had doubtless fallen on it.
<P>
"Wait a minute and we'll lift you up so that you will rest more comfortably,"
said Jerry, and, with the aid of his chums he made from their coats and some
seaweed a rude sort of bed for the man.
<P>
There was no doubt that the stranger's left arm was broken. It hung limply
down, and the least motion of it produced terrible pain. Fortunately the
man did not again lose his senses, and he directed the boys how to bandage
the arm close to his side, with their handkerchiefs tied together, so that
the injured member would not swing about, and further splinter the broken
bones.
<P>
"Do you think you can walk down to our boat?" asked Jerry. "We can take you
to a doctor, for I think you need one."
<P>
"Need one? I should say I did," replied the man. "It is a wonder I was not
killed by that fall. I'm afraid my ankle is sprained, but, after I rest a
bit, and get over this dizzy feeling, I'll try to walk to the boat. It's
lucky you boys happened to come along, just when you did."
<P>
"We didn't 'happen' to come along," said Jerry. "We were looking for you."
<P>
"Looking for me'?"
<P>
"Yes, we saw you and Blowitz talking on the cliffs in the moonlight, and
then we saw you disappear. We thought it was queer at the time," and Jerry
related the subsequent events.
<P>
"I'm glad you witnessed that," said the man, when Jerry had finished. "This
will be additional evidence against that scoundrel who intends to rob me,
and who tried to get me out of his way. However my time of reckoning will
come. But would you mind telling me your names?"
<P>
Jerry introduced himself and his companions, briefly, telling the reasons
for their presence in California.
<P>
"My name is De Vere," said the man. "Maurice De Vere. I was in partnership
with Blowitz, in several ventures, including the one in which a brig named
the <I>Rockhaven</I> is concerned."
<P>
"Are you interested in that?" asked Jerry eagerly. "Why that is the derelict
Blowitz wanted us to go in search of in the motor boat."
<P>
"He did? Now I understand why he wanted to get me out of the way!" cried
Maurice De Vere, quickly. "He was afraid I would meet you boys."
<P>
"Yes, and that's why he was in such a hurry for us to start," added Ned,
and they told of their dealings with Blowitz, and his anger at their refusal
to take part in his schemes.
<P>
"I can't be thankful enough to you boys," said the wounded man. "I don't
know what would have become of me if you hadn't happened to have seen Blowitz
push me from the cliff. I&mdash;I wish&mdash;"
<P>
Mr. De Vere seemed overcome by a sudden weakness, and fell back on the pile
of coats and seaweed.
<P>
"We had better get him to a doctor," said Ned. "He may be more injured than
we suppose."
<P>
"I&mdash;I'll be all right in a little while&mdash;that is all but my arm," said the
injured man faintly. "It was just a little weakness. If you will give me
some more water&mdash;"
<P>
They gave him some and he seemed to feel better after that. Then he tried
to rise, but he had to fall back again.
<P>
"My ankle&mdash;I think it's sprained," he said.
<P>
"Then let us carry you to the boat," suggested Jerry.
<P>
"I'm afraid you can't."
<P>
"Well, we can try."
<P>
They did, but it was hard work. By dint of carefully picking their steps
over the rocks, however, the three boys finally managed to get Mr. De Vere
into the cabin of the <I>Ripper, </I> where they made him comfortable on
the cushions.
<P>
"Now speed her up for the doctor's," said Jerry to Ned, who had taken charge
of the engine. "That is if you know where to find one."
<P>
"There is a physician whom I know, not far from the main wharf at San Felicity,"
said Maurice De Vere. "If you run the boat there I can get into a carriage
and drive right to his house. Then after he has set my arm, I should like
to tell you my story. That is, if you care to listen."
<P>
"We certainly do," said Jerry. "We will be very glad to help you in any way
that we can."
<P>
"Will you?" asked the man eagerly. "Then, perhaps, I can get ahead of Blowitz
after all."
<P>
Quick time was made to the dock, and, though it was quite late, the boys
found several public hackmen on hand. Mr. De Vere was put in one of the vehicles
and driven to the doctor's office, whither, after they had secured their
boat, the boys followed.
<P>
It took a little time to set the broken arm, and, after some restoratives
had been administered, and the sprained ankle, bandaged (though that hurt
was not as severe as at first supposed) Mr. De Vere received the boys in
his room, which his friend, the physician had provided.
<P>
"I do not want to detain you boys too long," he said, "and it is not necessary
to go into all the details of my story now. I will tell you a little of it,
and then I have a request to make of you. I have been making plans while
the doctor was working over me. It helped me to forget the pain."
<P>
"We'll do anything we can for you," promised Jerry, and the other boys nodded
in assent.
<P>
"Well, Blowitz and I have been associated in many enterprises," said Mr.
De Vere, "but, of late, I have had my suspicions of him. I began to fear
he was trying to get the best of me, so that he would control all the interests.
Now I am sure of it.
<P>
"We went equal shares in loading the brig <I>Rockhaven</I> with valuable
merchandise, for trade among the Santa Barbara Islands. There was also, aboard
the brig, some valuable papers, and a considerable sum in gold, that was
to go to a client of ours. After the ship was loaded I learned that Blowitz
sent some mysterious boxes aboard. They came from Boston, I understand. I&mdash;"
<P>
"Those are the boxes we saw in Cresville!" exclaimed Bob.
<P>
"What's that?" asked Mr. De Vere, and the boys explained the curious actions
of Blowitz in connection with the boxes.
<P>
"Very likely they were the same," said Mr. De Vere. "What they contained
I do not know, but I&mdash;"
<P>
"Excuse me for interrupting you," said Jerry, "but I think at least one of
the boxes contained something poisonous," and he related how the dog, in
the Cresville freight station, had been affected by smelling at the broken
package.
<P>
"That's it!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. De Vere, after a moment's thought. "I
see it all now. I can understand his actions. But I will explain later, for
I want to be very sure of my facts. At any rate, not to burden you with too
many details, after the brig had sailed, Blowitz wanted to purchase my interest
in her. As he offered me a large sum I consented, and I transferred all my
rights to him.
<P>
"As soon as I had done so he left town, and then I learned that he had cheated
me, for he had pretended to give me certain property for my share in the
ship, and this property he gave me was utterly worthless. I then considered
the deal off, and I knew that I still had a right to my half of the ship
and the cargo. But, more than this, I also learned that Blowitz had cheated
me in another way, by taking property and money that belonged to me. I consulted
my lawyers, and they told me I had a right to the entire ship
<I>Rockhaven</I> and all that it contained. I am the sole owner, and Blowitz
has no right to the brig nor anything on it. It is all mine, though he is
trying to get it.
<P>
"This all happened before the brig was abandoned and became a derelict, but
I can't understand how that happened, as she was a very stout vessel, though
small. There has been no collision, as far as I can learn. It is all something
of a mystery, but I am going to solve it. As soon as I learned what a scoundrel
Blowitz was, and of the wrecking of the brig, or, at least, the reported
wrecking of it, I came here for further news.
<P>
"When I met Blowitz I accused him of cheating me, and I claimed the brig,
when she should be found. He wanted to argue with me, and talked of seeing
lawyers, but I knew I was right. Then he asked me to meet him on the clips
to-night, to talk matters over. He said we might get some news of the ship
from the captain of a fishing smack.
<P>
"Rather foolishly I consented to meet him, and talk the thing over. We quarreled,
and he attacked me, with what result you saw. He pushed me over the cliff,
and fled, leaving me, I suppose he thought, for dead.
<P>
"Now what I am going to ask of you boys is this: Will you go with me in your
motor boat and search for the brig? Wait; do not give me an answer now. I
think I can prove to you that I have a right to the abandoned ship, and I
will pay you well for your time and trouble. Better than Blowitz offered
to. But do not decide in a hurry. I must get in a little better shape myself,
and then I have some arrangements to make. But I hope you will decide to
go. Of course, if you don't care to, I can hire some one else, but I would
rather have you boys. Now you can go home and think it over, and let me know
at your leisure."
<P>
The boys did not know what to say. Events had happened so rapidly that they
did not exactly understand all of them. They realized, however, that they
had another chance to go on a cruise on the Pacific, in the <I>Ripper, </I>
and they felt that they ought to take advantage of it, and aid Mr. De Vere.
<P>
"I think I shall have to break up this little party," said the physician,
coming in just then. "I can't have my patient getting a fever. You boys will
excuse me, I know, if I ask you to let him get some rest now."
<P>
"That's all right," spoke Jerry. "We'll see you to-morrow, Mr. De Vere."
<P>
"Very well," was the answer, and the boys left the injured man to the care
of the doctor.
<P>
"Well, what do you think of that?" asked Ned, as he and his chums were on
their way to the Seabury bungalow. "Isn't it simply great?"
<P>
"Great? It's immense!" exclaimed Bob. "We're going, aren't we, Jerry?"
<P>
"If you fellows say so, and outvote me, I suppose you are."
<P>
"But you want to go, don't you, Jerry?"
<P>
"I didn't say I did not. I think we have a different man to deal with, in
this Mr. De Vere, than we had in Blowitz. I think we shall go derelict hunting,
boys."
<P>
"And maybe we'll not have sport!" exclaimed Ned.
<P>
They were soon within sight of the bungalow. The storm clouds had continued
to gather, and the moon only shone at brief intervals. The wind was blowing
considerable, and there was every evidence that it would rain before morning.
<P>
"Guess we got in just in time," said Ned, as they entered the gateway. As
he spoke Ned came to a sudden stop. He was looking at a dark figure which
seemed to be stealing up to the bungalow.
<P>
It appeared to be that of a man, advancing so as to make no noise, and attract
no attention. The fitful gleams of moonlight showed him to be stooping over,
and, now and then, glints of light about him, indicated that he carried a
dark lantern, which he flashed at intervals to enable him to see his way.
<P>
"Look!" whispered Ned, grasping Jerry's arm.
<P>
"I see," was the low answer.
<P>
"It's a burglar," spoke Bob. "Let's creep up on him, and make a capture!"
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<h4>OFF ON A CRUISE</h4>
<P>
CAUTIOUSLY the boys advanced. They did not stop to think what they were going
to do, nor how they would capture the man, who, if he had evil designs, was
probably armed and desperate. With the sole desire of protecting from loss
their friends in the bungalow, they determined to prevent the man from breaking
into the place. That this seemed his intention was almost certain to the
boys, for they saw him approach one of the low windows, stop under it, and
flash his light several times.
<P>
"Now's our chance!" whispered Ned. "Let's creep up and jump on his back.
Then yell like mad and Ponto, and some of the servants will come and help
us."
<P>
With light footsteps, hardly making a sound that was not covered by the noise
of the wind in the trees, the boys advanced until they were within a few
feet of the man. He did not suspect their presence. The three chums were
trembling with nervousness and excitement.
<P>
Suddenly the man flashed a bright beam of light on the ground, and made a
quick motion.
<P>
"Now!" whispered Ned. "Jump boys!" for it looked as if the intruder was about
to open a window, and spring inside.
<P>
The chums leaped together, and fairly bore the man to the earth. Down they
came upon him, as if they were stopping a halfback, with a football, running
around right end on the second down.
<P>
"We've got him!" yelled Bob.
<P>
"Help! Help!" shouted Ned.
<P>
"Murder! Thieves! Robbers! Fire! Police! Help!"
<P>
These were cries coming from the man who was struggling to get rid of the
crushing weight of three healthy, sturdy boys.
<P>
"He's trying to get away!" called Jerry: "Hold him, fellows!"
<P>
"Let me go! Help! Help! I haven't any money!" pleaded the man underneath!"
Fire! Police! Help!"
<P>
"What is it?" cried Mr. Seabury, opening a window just over where the struggle
was going on, and thrusting his head out. "What's the matter?"
<P>
"We've caught a burglar!" cried Bob.
<P>
"A burglar? Hold him until I get my revolver! Ponto! Where are you? There's
a burglar below! Hurry up and help the boys! Where is that black rascal?
I'll bet he's gone to sleep again!"
<P>
"Comin'! I'se comin' Massa Seabury," answered Ponto's voice from the far
distance. "I were jest takin' a nap&mdash;"
<P>
"Do you take me for a burglar?" suddenly asked the wriggling man, as he succeeded
in getting his head from under Bob's stomach where it had practically been
out of sight. "Did you think I was trying to rob the house?"
<P>
"Of course; aren't you&mdash;" began Jerry, when a light flashing from one of
the windows, as Ponto approached, shone full on the prostrate man's face.
Upon the startled view of the boys there burst the vision of the peaceful,
though sadly surprised, face of Professor Snodgrass.
<P>
"Pro-fes-sor Snodgrass!" exclaimed Ned weakly.
<P>
"Pro-fes-sor," stammered Bob, rolling over in his astonishment.
<P>
"Well, if we&mdash;" began Jerry but he could not finish.
<P>
He let go his hold of the scientist's arm, and Ned at the same time loosened
his grip on the supposed burglar's leg. The professor arose, smoothed out
his rumpled clothing, and remarked in a sad tone:
<P>
"I suppose it's got away, now."
<P>
"What?" asked Ned.
<P>
"The horned toad. I was chasing one through the garden by the light of my
portable electric lantern. I cornered him under the window, and I was just
casting the net over him when you jumped on me. The toad got away. It's too
bad, but of course you didn't know it. I must continue my hunt, for at last
I am really on the track."
<P>
"Whar am dat bug'lar man?" suddenly demanded Ponto, opening the side door
a crack, and thrusting a gun out. "Whar am he? Jest hold him up agin this
yeah shootin' iron, young gem'mens, an' Ponto'll make him wish he done gone
stayed home? Whar am he?"
<P>
"Lookout for that gun," cautioned Ned. "It might be loaded. There's no burglar,
Ponto. It's all a mistake. It was Professor Snodgrass, hunting for horned
toads."
<P>
"Yes," added the scientist. "I heard they were always out just before a storm,
and so I went after them. I saw a fine specimen, but he got away. However
I shall catch him."
<P>
"No bug'lar, eh?" mused Ponto, in disappointed tones. "Golly, it shorely
am lucky fo' him dat dere ain't. I shorely would hab plugged him full ob
holes, dat's a fact!"
<P>
By this time Mr. Seabury had dressed and come down, and the girls were calling
in anxious voices to know what all the excitement was about. Matters were
soon explained, and the awakened household prepared to return to its normal
state. That is all but the professor; he decided to continue his toad hunt,
and, probably would have done so, but for the fact that it began to rain
just then, and there was such a down-pour that it was out of the question
to search in the garden.
<P>
"Anyway," the scientist consoled himself, "I don't believe the toads would
be out in the rain. I shall probably find one to-morrow," and, with that
comforting reflection he went to sleep.
<P>
Though it was rather late Mr. Seabury insisted on hearing from the boys the
rest of the adventure, part of which his daughters had told him. He was much
surprised at the disclosure of Blowitz's acts, and congratulated the boys
that they had had nothing to do with him.
<P>
"Do you think it would be safe to go with Mr. De Vere?" asked Ned.
<P>
"I think so," replied Mr. Seabury. "Of course you want to make an investigation,
but, if you find him all right, I see no reason why you should not go off
on a cruise after the derelict."
<P>
"Oh, I wish we could go," spoke Rose wistfully, but she knew it was out of
the question.
<P>
Mr. De Vere was much better the next day. The swelling in his ankle had gone
down, and he could walk around, though he had to carry his arm in a sling.
He sent for his lawyer, who soon proved that what the injured man had said
was true. The boys consulted further with Mr. Seabury during the next two
days, and made up their minds to go on the cruise.
<P>
"Now, when can you start?" asked Mr. De Vere, after this point had been settled.
"Or, rather, when can we start, for I intend to go with you, though I can't
do much with this broken arm
<P>
"We can go whenever you are ready," replied Jerry.
<P>
"Then I'll give orders to have the <I>Ripper</I> provisioned, for I am going
to pay all expenses. By the time we get ready I think this storm will have
blown over," for the wind and rain had continued for three days.
<P>
Under Maurice De Vere's directions preparations for the cruise were soon
completed. On the fourth day the storm blew away and there was the promise
of settled weather, though some old sailors, down at the dock, said there
were liable to be high winds for some time yet.
<P>
The <I>Ripper</I> was overhauled, a plentiful cargo of provisions and supplies
had been stowed aboard, and, having bid good-bye to their friends, the Seaburys,
the boys were ready for their cruise.
<P>
"When will you come back?" asked Rose, as she and her sisters went down to
the dock to see the party off.
<P>
"When we find the derelict," answered Jerry.
<P>
"Good luck!" said Nellie.
<P>
"Don't let a sea serpent catch you," cautioned Olivia, as she waved her hand.
<P>
Jerry threw on the switch, Ned turned the fly wheel over, there was a throbbing
of the cylinders, and the <I>Ripper</I> was off on her long cruise after
the derelict brig.
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<h4>HUNTING THE DERELICT</h4>
<P>
"WELL, now that we're under way," said Jerry, who had assumed charge of the
engine, "in which direction do you propose going, Mr. De Vere? We are under
your orders you know."
<P>
"There are to be no special orders given on this cruise," was the answer.
"I regard you boys as my partners in this enterprise. We will all do our
best to find the brig, and if any of you have any suggestions, I hope you
will not hesitate to offer them. To be frank with you I do not know where
to look for the <I>Rockhaven. </I> She is somewhere in this vicinity, floating
around, but at the mercy of wind, wave and cross currents. All we can do
is to cruise about, hoping to get a sight of her."
<P>
"I thought when you searched for anything on the ocean you had to have the
longitude and latitude," said Rob.
<P>
"So you do usually," replied Mr. De Vere, but, in this case it is impossible
to get those figures. If it were it would be an easy matter to pick up the
brig. But, in the case of a derelict, that is floating about, going in no
particular direction, and making only such speed as the wind or the currents
give it, there is no telling where it will drift to. It might be at one spot
at night, and many miles off the next morning."
<P>
"We are prepared for a long cruise," spoke Ned, "and it doesn't matter which
way we go. How would it do to go about in big circles, taking a new one every
day?"
<P>
"That's a good plan," said the owner of the <I>Rockhaven. </I> "We might
try it, at any rate."
<P>
So this was done. With chart and compass Mr. De Vere, who understood the
science of navigation, worked out a plan of traveling about in big sweeps,
that took in a goodly portion of that part of the Pacific. They had some
strong marine glasses aboard and, with these, they would take an observation,
every now and then, to see if there was any sight of the brig. As they did
not expect to come upon her close to the harbor of San Felicity, this work
was not undertaken until the afternoon of the first day.
<P>
In the meanwhile the <I>Ripper's</I> cabin had been put in ship-shape, bunks
were arranged for sleeping and, at his request Bob was put in charge of the
galley, to prepare the meals and be cook.
<P>
"And mind," cautioned Jerry, "don't eat all the things yourself. Give us
a chance, once in a while."
<P>
"Of course; what do you think I am?" asked Bob indignantly.
<P>
"I don't think&mdash;I know," replied Jerry with a laugh.
<P>
Mr. De Vere could not do much to help the boys as, with his broken arm in
a sling, he had to be careful how he moved about so that he would not be
tossed against the side of the boat and injured. The <I>Ripper</I> was a
large boat, for one of the motor class, but, when it got outside the harbor,
and felt the full force of the Pacific swell, it was not as easy riding as
the boys had imagined. At first they were a little inclined to be seasick,
as it was some time since they had been on such a big stretch of water, but,
after a while, they got used to it.
<P>
The approach of night found them many miles from the harbor, but they had
had no sight of the derelict, nor, did they expect to. If the deserted brig
was anywhere in the vicinity, it must be pretty well out to sea, Mr. De Vere
told them. So when it got dark, and lights were set aglow in the cozy cabin,
it was with light hearts that the boys and their friends gathered around
the supper table, Bob had prepared a good meal, and they enjoyed it very
much.
<P>
They took turns at the night watches, the boat continuing to steam on ahead,
and the person on the lookout taking occasional observations of the dark
horizon through powerful night glasses.
<P>
Morning found them upon a waste of waters, out of sight of land, and with
not a sail in view.
<P>
"Say, but it's lonesome," remarked Bob when he went to the galley to get
breakfast. "What a big place the ocean is."
<P>
"I suppose you expected to find a lot of excursion boats out here," remarked
Jerry.
<P>
"I did not!" exclaimed Bob. "But I thought we might see a ship or two."
<P>
For two days they cruised about, moving in great circles and keeping a sharp
watch for any sight of the derelict. Several times one of the boys, after
peering through the glasses, would call that they had sighted her, and the
motor boat would be rushed in that direction. But, each time, it only resulted
in disappointment for what they saw turned out to be only a bit of wreckage,
a big dead fish, or some floating box or barrel, thrown overboard from some
ship.
<P>
"It looks as if our search was going to be longer than I at first thought,"
said Mr. De Vere on the fifth day. "It is a good thing we are well provisioned
and have plenty of gasolene."
<P>
"Yes, we could stay out for three weeks if necessary," replied Jerry.
<P>
"I hope we don't have to," went on the owner of the brig. "A week ought to
bring us within sight of her, if she still floats. But there is no telling
what that scoundrel Blowitz may have done. He is capable of having some one
of the crew bore holes in the ship before they deserted hEr, so she would
slowly sink, and he could collect the insurance. In fact he may have done
so, and only be pretending that she is a derelict. I wish we would get sight
of her. A great deal, so far as my fortune is concerned, depends on the result
of this search."
<P>
The boys, no less than Maurice De Vere, were anxious to sight the derelict,
not so much for the prize money, but because they wanted to be successful,
and have their cruise result in something.
<P>
Another day went by, and, though they sighted several vessels in the distance,
no water-logged craft or slowly drifting derelict greeted their eyes.
<P>
"We'll hope for better luck to-morrow," said Mr. De Vere as darkness began
to fall, "though from the weather indications, I would say we were in for
a blow."
<P>
"It does look as if getting ready for a storm," admitted Jerry.
<P>
There was a curious stillness to the air, and the ocean had a queer oily
look, the waves heaving restlessly as though they were impatient at their
slow motion, and wanted to break into a wild revel.
<P>
Off to the west there was a murky, yellowish look to the sky, and, now and
then, there came puffs of wind that had in them a hint of great force and
power.
<P>
"We had better make everything as snug as possible," advised Mr. De Vere.
"If it comes on to blow in the night we'll have our hands full to manage
the boat."
<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
<h4>IN A BAD STORM</h4>
<P>
SHORTLY after midnight, Jerry who was to take the last, or dog-watch was
awakened by Ned shaking him in his bunk.
<P>
"What&mdash;what's the matter?" asked Jerry sleepily.
<P>
"You'd better get up I think. The boat is pitching something fierce, and
it's beginning to blow great guns."
<P>
"Um!" exclaimed Jerry, as he got out of his bunk, and was thrown up against
a bulkhead by a roll of the boat. "I should say it was pitching some. Where's
Rob? Where's Mr. De Vere?"
<P>
"I didn't call them. I thought I'd tell you first and see what you thought."
<P>
"Wait until I take a look outside," said Jerry, dressing as best he could
while swaying to and fro with the motion of the <I>Ripper. </I>
<P>
"Here! Quit your fooling!" suddenly exclaimed Bob, as he rolled from his
bunk, and barely saved himself from a bad shock by landing on his hands and
feet in a crouching attitude, as does a cat. "What did you do that for?"
<P>
"You'll have to ask Father Neptune," answered Jerry. "We're not guilty, Chunky."
<P>
"Didn't you pull me from my bunk?" asked the stout youth.
<P>
It needed no answer from his chums to assure him to the contrary. The motor
boat was now pitching and tossing violently, and, as the boys stood in the
cabin, they had hard work to prevent themselves from being thrown from partition
to partition. Had it not been for their forethought in making everything
secure earlier in the night, the boat might have been damaged.
<P>
"What's the matter, boys?" asked Mr. De Vere, looking out from his small
stateroom. "Oh, it's the storm. Arrived strictly on time, I guess, and it's
a hummer too! How's the engine working?"
<P>
"Fine," declared Ned, who had just left the motor cockpit. "Runs like a charm,
and hasn't missed an explosion since I took charge."
<P>
"That's good," commented Mr. De Vere. "We'll need all the power we can get,
to keep her head on to the waves, if this gets any worse."
<P>
As he spoke there was a thundering crash on the deck above them, and a rush
of water told that a big comber had come aboard, nearly burying the small
craft in a swirl of green water.
<P>
"Are the hatches closed," asked Mr. De Vere anxiously, "and the sliding doors
fastened?"
<P>
"Yes," replied Ned. "I saw to that when I noticed the wind was getting worse,
and the waves higher."
<P>
The boat was fitted with a cabin over the full length, but amidships, where
the motor was, were sliding partitions that could be taken down, thus making
that part of the craft open. Ned had put these slides in place, securely
fastening them, and closing the top hatches. The derelict hunters were thus
completely shut up in the <I>Ripper, </I> and could manage the engine, and
run the boat without exposing themselves. Only for this the big wave might
have swamped them.
<P>
Maurice De Vere quickly dressed and, with the boys went to the engine
compartment. The motor was humming and throbbing, and, at Jerry's suggestion,
Ned gave the wheels and cogs an additional dose of oil.
<P>
The storm rapidly increased in fury, and the boat was pitching and tossing
in a manner that made it difficult to get from one part to another. But the
<I>Ripper</I> was a substantial craft and though her nose, many times, was
buried deep under some big sea, she managed to work her way out, staggering
under the shock, but going on, like the gallant boat she was.
<P>
The engine, from which one or another of the boys never took his eyes, worked
to perfection. If it had failed them, and they had gotten into the trough
of the sea, there probably would have been a different story to tell of the
motor boys on the Pacific.
<P>
"This is getting fierce!" exclaimed Bob; after a particularly big wave had
deluged the boat.
<P>
"Getting fierce?" repeated Jerry. "It's been fierce for some time. I hope
it doesn't get any worse."
<P>
But, if it did not increase in violence, the storm showed no signs of ceasing.
The wind fairly howled around the frail boat, as if angry that it could not
overwhelm it, and beat it down under the waves, which were altogether too
big for the safe or comfortable riding of the <I>Ripper. </I>
<P>
There was nothing to do save watch the engine, keep the wheel steady, and
the boat pointed head on to the waves. The three boys took turns at this,
for no one would now venture back to his bunk. Mr. De Vere could do little,
for his broken arm hampered him, and, in order that he might suffer no further
injury, he braced himself in a corner, where he would be comparatively safe
from the pitching and tossing.
<P>
"Wow! That was a bad one!" exclaimed Bob, as another heavy wave thundered
on the deck, and ran hissing along the scuppers.
<P>
"I think you had better get out the life preservers," suggested Mr. De Vere,
when several more tremendous waves followed in quick succession.
<P>
"Do you think we are in danger?" asked Ned.
<P>
"No more than we were some time ago," was the rather grave answer. "But it
is best to be prepared. We seem to be running into the center of the storm,
instead of away from it."
<P>
"I'll get the cork jackets," volunteered Jerry, going to the lockers where
the preservers were kept.
<P>
They were placed where they could be quickly put on in case the boat foundered,
and then, with white, set faces the boys prepared to watch out the remainder
of the night, looking to the engine occasionally, and hoping fervently that
they would weather the storm.
<P>
It was not cold, for they were in the latitude close to perpetual summer,
and there was no rain, only that never-ceasing wind which piled the waves
up in great foam-capped masses. On and on the boat staggered, now scarcely
making any progress at all, and, again, during a lull shooting through the
water at great speed. Sometimes the screw would be "racing," as the stern
lifted clear of the water, and again the powerful motor would be almost at
a standstill, so great was the pressure of the waves on the blades of the
propeller.
<P>
"It doesn't seem to be getting any worse," remarked Bob after a long silence,
broken only by the howl of the wind. "We haven't been boarded by any seas
lately."
<P>
"No, I think we have gone through the most dangerous part of it," agreed
Mr. De Vere. "But we're still far from being out of danger. There is a very
heavy sea on."
<P>
They waited and hoped. The throb of the engine became a monotonous hum and
whir, and the crash of the waves like the boom of some big drum. Rob, looking
through one of the cabin dead-eyes, exclaimed:
<P>
"See!"
<P>
The others looked out.
<P>
"It's getting morning," spoke Jerry, with a sigh of relief. "The night is
almost gone."
<P>
Gradually it became lighter, the pale gray dawn stealing in through the thick
bull's-eyes, and revealing the rather pale faces of the young derelict hunters.
They looked out on a heaving waste of waters, the big waves rising and falling
like some gigantic piece of machinery.
<P>
"The wind is dying down," announced Ned in a low voice. Somehow it seemed
as if they ought to talk in whispers.
<P>
"Yes, I think it will stop when the sun comes up," said Mr. De Vere. "It
looks as if it would be clear."
<P>
In the east there appeared a rosy light. A golden beam shot up to the sky,
tinting the crests of the waves. Then the rim of Old Sol appeared, to cheer
the voyagers.
<P>
"Look there!" suddenly called Jerry, pointing straight at the disk of the
sun, which, every second, was becoming larger.
<P>
They all looked and saw, laboring in the waves, about a mile away, a powerful
tug, that seemed to be following them.
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
<h4>RIVAL SEARCHERS</h4>
<P>
"WHAT boat is that?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Hand me the glasses," requested Mr. De Vere, as he went nearer to the cabin
port. He peered through the binoculars for some time, then announced:
<P>
"It's the steam tug, <I>Monarch, </I> from San Pedro. I wonder what it can
be doing out this way?"
<P>
"Perhaps it was blown out of its course by the storm," suggested Jerry. "I'm
sure we must have been."
<P>
"Very likely," admitted Mr. De Vere. "Still that is a very powerful boat,
and the captain must have some reason to be keeping after us the way he is
doing."
<P>
"Do you think they are following us?" asked Ned.
<P>
"It certainly looks so. We're headed straight out to sea now," he added,
after a glance at the compass. "If the tug was out of it's course it would
be turned about and going the other way. Instead it is coming right after
us."
<P>
This was very evident, for, as the <I>Ripper</I> was laboring through the
waves, the other vessel kept in her wake, and seemed to be overhauling the
motor boat.
<P>
"Well, it's a free country; I suppose they have a right to be here," spoke
Jerry.
<P>
"Yes," said Mr. De Vere, watching the tug through the glasses, "but I don't
like their actions."
<P>
"Why not? Do you think&mdash;" began Jerry.
<P>
"I don't like to say what I think," was the answer. "We will have to wait
and see what develops. But I propose that we have some breakfast, or, at
least, some hot coffee, if Bob can manage to stand in the galley. It has
been a hard night for us."
<P>
Bob soon demonstrated that he could get up a breakfast under rather adverse
circumstances, and the derelict hunters were soon drinking hot coffee, though
they had to hold the partly-filled cups in one hand, and maintain their balance
by clinging with the other to some part of the cabin.
<P>
The day was clear, and, save for the high waves, there were no evidences
of the storm. The big sea, however, was not likely to subside soon, and the
<I>Ripper</I> had to stagger along as best she could, which task she performed
to the great satisfaction of the voyagers.
<P>
Maurice De Vere seemed much worried by the appearance of the tug, which hung
on the wake of the <I>Ripper, </I> maintaining a speed that kept it about
a mile to the rear. The owner of the <I>Rockhaven</I> kept the glasses almost
continually on the steam vessel, and the anxious look did not leave his face.
<P>
"Can you slow down the engine a bit?" he asked of Jerry, who had relieved
Ned at the motor.
<P>
"Yes, if you want me to, Why?"
<P>
"I'd like that other boat to come closer to us. I want to see if I can make
out who is aboard. If we slacken our speed they may approach before they
see the trick, and I can form some opinion of what this strange chase means."
<P>
"What do you think it means?" asked Ned.
<P>
"I'm afraid it indicates that Blowitz is after us," replied Mr. De Vere.
"I think he has heard of our voyage after the brig and has hired this tug
to try and beat me. But slow down, and let us see what happens. The waves
are not so high now, and you can do it with safety."
<P>
Accordingly Jerry reduced the speed of the motor. The <I>Ripper</I> at once
began to lose headway, and Mr. De Vere, watching the oncoming tug through
the binoculars, announced:
<P>
"She'll be closer in a little while, and I can make out the man on deck,
who seems to be directing operations."
<P>
The boys anxiously waited. Their employer kept the glasses to his eyes, though
it was tiresome work, holding them with one hand. Suddenly he exclaimed:
<P>
"I can see him quite plainly, now!"
<P>
"Who is it?" asked Jerry quickly.
<P>
"Carson Blowitz! He, too, is after the derelict! He is going to try and cheat
me again!"
<P>
Nearer and nearer approached the steam tug, for the pilot had, evidently,
not taken into consideration the fact that the <I>Ripper</I> was going ahead
at reduced speed. Soon it was close enough for the boys, without the aid
of the glasses, to make out the figure of Blowitz.
<P>
"I must go outside," announced Mr. De Vere. "Give me a hand, Jerry, so I
won't stumble and hurt my broken arm."
<P>
"What are you going to do?"
<P>
"I'm going to ask Blowitz what he means by following me; and whether he is
trying to find the derelict that belongs to me."
<P>
Jerry assisted Mr. De Vere out on the small deck in front of the cabin. By
this time the <I>Monarch</I> was within hailing distance, those in charge
of her evidently having decided to give up trying to remain in the rear.
<P>
<I>"Ripper</I> ahoy!" called Carson Blowitz, waving his hand at the little
group on deck.
<P>
"What do you want, you scoundrel?" asked Mr. De Vere angrily. "What do you
mean by following me?"
<P>
"Rather strong language, my dear partner," was the taunting answer from Blowitz.
"Besides I don't know that I am following you. The ocean is big enough for
two boats, I guess."
<P>
"Do you deny that you are following me, and seeking to find the derelict
<I>Rockhaven?"</I> demanded Mr. De Vere.
<P>
"I deny nothing&mdash;I admit nothing, my dear partner."
<P>
"I am no longer in partnership with you, since you tried to cheat me," was
the answer. "I consider our relations at an end."
<P>
"Very well. But I am sorry to see that you are hurt. I hope it is nothing
serious."
<P>
"No thanks to you that I was not killed! You meant to end my life when you
pushed me over the cliff, and, as soon as this business is settled I intend
to see that you are punished for your crimes. You have gone too far, Carson
Blowitz."
<P>
"Not as far as I intend to go!" suddenly exclaimed the other, with a change
in his manner. The two boats were now side by side, not twenty feet away.
"You have guessed it," he went on. "I am after the derelict brig, and I intend
to get her. I am going to finish you before I am through. That ship is mine,
and all the cargo on her. If you attempt to touch it I shall have to take
stringent measures to prevent you. I warn you not to interfere with my property!"
<P>
"Your property!" cried Maurice De Vere. "That brig and all on it is mine,
by every legal claim, and I shall maintain my rights to the uttermost."
<P>
"Very well then, it is to be a fight!" answered Blowitz. "We are to be rival
seekers after the derelict. Possession is nine points of the law, and I intend
to take possession."
<P>
"First you'll have to find it."
<P>
"Never fear. I am on the track. Good-bye, my recent partner. Sorry I can't
keep you company."
<P>
Blowitz waved his hand, as though in friendly farewell, but Mr. De Vere turned
aside, refusing to notice him, for the scoundrel had greatly wronged him,
and was now adding insult to injury.
<P>
There was a ringing of bells on the tug, and the powerful vessel forged ahead,
leaving the <I>Ripper</I> astern.
<P>
"Shall we speed up?" asked Jerry. "We can easily beat them, for ours is the
faster boat."
<P>
"No, let him go," replied Mr. De Vere. "He has no more idea, than have I,
where to look for the derelict. He is taking the same chances we are, but
I'll not follow him. As he says, we are rivals now. I hope I win, for my
whole fortune depends on it."
<P>
"We'll do our best to help you," said Bob.
<P>
"That's what we will," added Jerry, and Ned nodded an assent.
<P>
"Bear off to the left," suggested Mr. De Vere, as a cloud of black smoke
from the funnel of the tug showed that the engineer was crowding on steam.
"We'll part company from them."
<P>
Speeding up the engine Jerry steered the <I>Ripper</I> out of the course
of the <I>Monarch. </I> The hunt of the rivals to locate the derelict brig
was now on.
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>
<h4>THE DERELICT</h4>
<P>
"THEY don't seem to be following us now," observed Ned, after they had watched
the tug continuing on her course.
<P>
"No, it looks as if they were taking another tack," said Maurice De Vere.
"I wonder if he can have private information as to the location of the brig?
If he has he may get ahead of me and discover her first."
<P>
"I don't believe he has," was Jerry's opinion. "I think he is on a blind
search, just as we are."
<P>
"I hope so. It means a great deal to me to find that derelict."
<P>
"What had we better do?" asked Bob. "Can't we get ahead of him in some way?"
<P>
"I know of no other way than to cruise about until we find the brig," replied
Mr. De Vere. "It is only a chance, but luck may favor us first. That is all
we can hope for."
<P>
All that day they cruised fruitlessly about, and the next day was equally
barren of result.
<P>
"I'm afraid you'll think we're not very good derelict hunters," remarked
Jerry on the morning of the third day after the storm, when they took an
observation, and saw nothing but a vast extent of water. The weather was
calm, the sun shone brightly and the <I>Ripper</I> was making good time.
<P>
"No," was the answer. "It isn't your fault. This was in the nature of an
experiment, and I do not expect immediate results. I figured on being three
weeks on this search, and we have only spent about a third of that time.
We are yet on the safe side, although I admit it is rather disappointing."
<P>
After breakfast they resumed their observations. It was nearly eight bells
when Ned, who had been stationed in the bow with the powerful glasses, cried
out:
<P>
"I see something."
<P>
"Where?" asked Mr. De Vere eagerly.
<P>
"Off the left."
<P>
Mr. De Vere took the glasses and peered long and anxiously through them at
a small speck which Ned pointed out as it rose and fell on the crest of the
billows.
<P>
"Is it the derelict?" asked Jerry, appearing in the companionway.
<P>
"I don't know," answered Ned. "It looks like some sort of a ship, but I'm
afraid to be positive, because we've had so many false alarms."
<P>
"It's some sort of a ship," remarked Mr. De Vere suddenly as he passed the
glasses to Jerry. "I make it out to be a brig, and, from the way it is jibing
about, it seems to be under no control. See what you think."
<P>
Jerry took a careful look.
<P>
"It's a brig, sure enough," he declared, "and I can't see any sign of life
on her."
<P>
"Put us over that way," requested Mr. De Vere, of Ned, who was steering and
running the engine. "When we get a little nearer I may be able to make out
the name."
<P>
There were anxious hearts beating in the breasts of those aboard the <I>Ripper.
</I> Could it be possible that the ship they saw was the derelict for which
they had been searching? They all hoped so.
<P>
Ned speeded the motor up to the highest notch and the boat fairly flew through
the calm sea. Near and nearer it came to the ship, which could now plainly
be made out. There was not a sail set, and this was peculiar in itself. The
brig idly rose and fell on the long, heaving swells.
<P>
"It's my ship!" suddenly cried Mr. De Vere, after a lengthy observation through
the binoculars. "I can make out her name. It's the <I>Rockhaven! </I> Hurrah,
boys! We have found her at last!"
<P>
"And Blowitz and his tug are nowhere in sight!" cried Ned. "We have beaten
him!"
<P>
"Indeed we have," went on Mr. De Vere. "Now, Ned, see how soon you can put
us alongside."
<P>
"It will not take long," declared the young engineer. "It's only a few miles."
<P>
The <I>Ripper</I> proved worthy of her name, for she fairly "ripped" through
the waves, and, in a short time, was so close to the derelict that they had
to slow up.
<P>
"Put us up under the port quarter," advised Mr. De Vere. "Luckily there is
not much of a swell on, and we can easily get aboard as she sets low in the
water. She must be leaking."
<P>
With skillful hand Ned brought the motor boat alongside. The anchor chains
were hanging low from the hawse holes and as they approached Jerry prepared
to catch hold and swing himself up. He had reached out his hand, and was
just going to grasp the links, when, from the deck of the deserted brig there
came savage growls and barks. Jerry jumped back in alarm and Ned, who had
jammed a boat hook in the side of the brig, to hold the <I>Ripper</I> steady,
looked up.
<P>
"It's dogs!" he cried. "Two of 'em!"
<P>
As he spoke two savage looking creatures thrust their heads up over the low
rail. They were large dogs, of the wolf-hound variety; great shaggy creatures,
and they growled in a menacing manner.
<P>
"They must have left the dogs aboard when they so strangely deserted the
ship," said Mr. De Vere. "I suppose they're glad to see us. They must be
lonesome. Try again, Jerry. I would, if I had the use of my two arms."
<P>
Once more Jerry prepared to ascend by means of the chains, but the dogs almost
leaped over the rail at him, showing their teeth, while the hair on as much
of their backs as could be seen stood up in ridges. Foam dripped from their
jaws.
<P>
"Look out!" cried Bob. "Those dogs are mad! Be careful!"
<P>
Savage growls and barks from the angry beasts emphasized his words. There
was no doubt of it. The dogs were mad from fear and hunger. They disputed
the advance of the voyagers, and would not let them aboard.
<P>
"Try on the other side," suggested Mr. De Vere.
<P>
The boat was worked around to the other side of the bow, but the dogs followed,
and stood on guard there.
<P>
"Maybe we can get up at the stern," said Jerry. "Perhaps the dogs can't make
their way aft."
<P>
But it was the same there. The maddened animals were ready to fly at the
throats of any one who should attempt to board the derelict.
<P>
"What's to be done?" asked Ned. "We didn't count on this. Those are fierce
dogs."
<P>
"Indeed they are," replied Mr. De Vere. "It would not be safe to risk getting
too close to them."
<P>
"But what can we do?" asked Jerry. "If we wait here too long, Blowitz may
appear."
<P>
"We've got to do something," said the boy's employer. "The only thing I can
see to do is to shoot the dogs. I'll get my rifle," and he went into the
cabin, where he had left his weapon, one of several he had brought aboard.
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>
<h4>A MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE</h4>
<P>
"ONE of you boys will have to do the shooting," said Maurice De Vere, as
he came out on the small forward deck with his rifle. "I'm a pretty good
marksman, but I can't do anything when I have this broken arm."
<P>
"Let Jerry try," suggested Ned. "He's the best shot of us three."
<P>
"Oh, I don't know," spoke Jerry modestly, but Mr. De Vere handed him the
rifle.
<P>
"We have no time to lose," he said. "Blowitz may be here at any hour, and,
as he said, possession is nine points of the law. I want to get aboard."
<P>
Jerry looked to the loading of the weapon, and then, at his suggestion the
motor boat was backed off some yards.
<P>
"I want to see to get a good shot, and put the poor things out of their misery
as soon as possible," he said.
<P>
The dogs acted more wild than ever as they saw the motor boat moving about.
They almost leaped overboard, as they raced about the derelict and finally,
they both jumped on the quarter deck, where they stood in bold relief.
<P>
"Now's your chance, Jerry!" cried Ned.
<P>
Jerry took quick aim, steadying himself as best he could against the motion
of the boat. The rifle cracked, and, at the same instant one of the dogs
gave a howl, a convulsive leap, and, a second later was floundering in the
water.
<P>
"There's one of the poor brutes gone," remarked Mr. De Vere. "Now, once more,
Jerry. I hate to kill the dogs, for they are valuable animals, but it is
a question of their lives or ours, and it would not be safe to let them live."
<P>
The remaining dog, startled by the rifle shot, and the disappearance of its
companion stood in mute surprise on the quarter deck. He offered a good shot,
and Jerry fired. The dog howled, and began whirling about in a circle, snapping
its jaws.
<P>
"You've only wounded him!" exclaimed Bob.
<P>
Before any one else could speak Jerry had fired the repeater again. This
time the bullet went true, and the dog fell to the deck, gave a few convulsive
struggles, and was still.
<P>
"That settles him," remarked Mr. De Vere.
<P>
"Now, boys, we'll go aboard, and I'll get what belongs to me. Then we'll
see if we can tow the ship in."
<P>
The <I>Ripper</I> was once more put alongside the brig, cork buffers were
adjusted to prevent damage being done, and, in a few minutes Jerry had scrambled
up on deck.
<P>
"That's a fierce brute," he remarked to Bob who followed him, as they stood
looking at the dead dog. "I'm glad I didn't have to tackle him at close
quarters."
<P>
"Let's heave him overboard," suggested Bob, and they did so, though it took
all their strength to drag the body to the rail.
<P>
"I guess you'll have to lower the accommodation ladder for me, boys," said
Mr. De Vere. "I don't believe I can scramble up by way of the chains, as
you did."
<P>
"Wait until I get up there and I'll give you a hand," called Ned, who had
been left in the motor boat.
<P>
"No, you had better stay here and help fasten the ladder when Bob and Jerry
lower it," answered Mr. De Vere. "I'll need your aid."
<P>
After some little difficulty, for part of the tackle had fouled, Bob and
Jerry succeeded in lowering over the ship's side an accommodation ladder,
somewhat like a short flight of steps. It hung above the <I>Ripper's</I>
deck, and when some ropes had been strung for hand rails, Mr. De Vere was
able to ascend, holding on by one hand, and was soon on the deck of the brig.
<P>
"At last!" he exclaimed. "Here we are! I was afraid we'd never find her,
and, if we did, that Blowitz would be ahead of me. But, thanks to you, boys,
I have beaten him. Now I must see if my papers are safe."
<P>
"Where will you look for them?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"They must be somewhere in the captain's cabin. That is where the gold will
likely be. I suppose we'll have to hunt for it."
<P>
"Shall we help you?"
<P>
"Yes, if you will. Let's go below. Is the motor boat securely made fast?"
<P>
"I'll guarantee she'll not drift away," declared Ned, as he and his companions
followed Mr. De Vere to the main cabin.
<P>
On every side were evidences of a hurried abandonment of the brig. Some of
the sailors had gone off without taking all their clothing, for garments
were scattered here and there. Things were in confusion below decks, and
the captain's cabin showed signs of having been ransacked.
<P>
"There is something queer about this," said Mr. De Vere as he surveyed the
scene. "The ship is not sinking, and I don't believe it has leaked a drop,
though at first I thought so. There was no collision, for there is no sign
of damage. Yet there is every indication that captain and crew deserted the
brig in a hurry. Now what made them do that? Why did not Blowitz give me
some reason for that? What caused the abandonment of the brig?"
<P>
"Perhaps the sailors got superstitious, I've often read that they do," suggested
Jerry.
<P>
"I hardly think so."
<P>
"Maybe they were afraid of the mad dogs," said Bob.
<P>
"I don't believe the dogs went mad until after the sailors left," was Mr.
De Vere's answer. "No, there is some strange secret connected with the brig,
and I'd like to solve it. But I must first find my papers and the gold."
<P>
"Suppose the captain took them with him?" remarked Ned.
<P>
"He did not know about them. That is he did not know of what the valuables
consisted. The gold and papers were put in a safe, and only Blowitz and myself
had the combination. The safe was placed in the captain's cabin, and he was
instructed to deliver it, unopened, to a certain man. When they deserted
the ship in such a hurry I do not believe they took the safe with them. It
must be somewhere on board. We'll search for it."
<P>
The cabin was rather large, and contained a number of lockers and other places
that might serve as a hiding place for the safe. The boys and Mr. De Vere
made a careful hunt. While they were in the midst of it a sudden noise startled
them.
<P>
"What was that?" asked Bob.
<P>
"The cabin door slid shut," answered Jerry, who had seen what happened. "I'll
open it."
<P>
"Here's the safe!" suddenly called Mr. De Vere, as he opened a small locker,
in an out-of-the-way corner. "Help me get it out, boys, and we'll open it."
<P>
The closed door was forgotten, and the three lads, at their employer's
suggestion, fastened a rope about the safe and pulled it out. It rolled on
small wheels.
<P>
"Sorry I can't help you much," spoke Mr. De Vere, "but this arm of mine prevents
me."
<P>
"Oh, we can manage it all right," declared Jerry, and after a while, they
succeeded in wheeling the safe out into the middle of the cabin.
<P>
"There is some other stuff in the locker," announced Bob, as he peered within.
"It looks like those small boxes Mr. Blowitz shipped from Cresville."
<P>
"That's what they are," added Jerry, taking a look. "Now we have a chance
to see what is in them."
<P>
"Wait until we get the safe open," advised Mr. De Vere. "Then we'll see if
we can't get at the secret of the ship."
<P>
He sat down in front of the strong steel box, and began to turn the combination.
It was quite complicated, and took some time.
<P>
"Um-m-m-m-m!" exclaimed Bob, with a lazy stretch. "I'm beginning to feel
sleepy. Guess I'll lie down on this couch and rest."
<P>
He did so, and, somewhat to his companions' surprise, was soon apparently
asleep.
<P>
"He must be pretty well played out," remarked Ned. "Funny, but I feel a little
drowsy myself. We haven't been getting any too much sleep, of late, I suppose."
<P>
Mr. De Vere was working away at the combination of the safe. Something seemed
to have gone wrong with it, and he twirled the knobs and dials, first this
way and that.
<P>
"What a curious ringing sound they make," Jerry was thinking, as he sat in
a chair and looked on. "It's just like bells away off somewhere. I wonder
if it's my ears? I feel as if I had taken quinine for a cold. There seems
to be some sort of a haze in the cabin. I wonder&mdash;"
<P>
But Jerry never knew what he wondered, for the same mysterious influence
that had overpowered Bob had made Jerry succumb. His head fell forward on
his breast, and he was unconscious.
<P>
Ned began to imagine he was in a boiler factory, of which Mr. De Vere was
the foreman. The latter seemed to be hammering on a big steel safe, and soon,
in Ned's ears there echoed the noise of the blows. Then the boy's eyes closed,
and he joined Bob and Jerry in falling under the mysterious spell.
<P>
Seated on the floor in front of the safe Mr. De Vere wondered what made his
fingers move so slowly. With his one good hand he could scarcely turn the
dials of the combination. His head, too, felt very heavy, and once there
was such a mist before his eyes that he could not see the figures on the
shining disk of the safe.
<P>
"This is queer," he murmured. "It is very close in this cabin. I wish the
boys had opened the door. I wish&mdash;I&mdash;"
<P>
Mr. De Vere fell over backward, unconscious, while, around the silent forms
in the cabin wreathed a thin bluish vapor that came from the locker where
the safe had been, and where there were some small boxes&mdash;the same mysterious
boxes that Blowitz had shipped from Cresville.
<P>
In the tightly-closed cabin the derelict hunters were now at the mercy of
the mysterious influence&mdash;an influence they could not see or guard against,
and from which they were in deadly peril.
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
<h4>A COMMAND TO LAY TO</h4>
<P>
STRANGE things happen on the ocean. Sometimes slight occurrences lead to
great results. When the sailors deserted the brig <I>Rockhaven, </I> provisioning
their boats in a hurry, one water cask was left behind. The mate had intended
stowing it away in the captain's gig, but found there was no room for it,
so he allowed it to remain on deck, where he set it.
<P>
In due time, by the motion of the abandoned brig in the storm, the water
cask was overturned and rolled about at every heave of the waves, first to
port, and then to starboard, Now aft, and again forward. As luck would have
it, not long after those in the cabin fell under the deadly influence of
some queer, stupefying fumes, the water cask was rolling about close to the
trunk roof of the cabin, a roof that had side windows in it.
<P>
With one lurch of the ship the water cask nearly crashed against these windows,
but, by the narrowest margin missed. Then the cask rolled toward the scuppers.
Those in the cabin were more than ever under the influence of the fumes.
They were breathing heavily, the veins in their necks began to swell, their
hearts were laboring hard to overcome the stupefying influence of the fumes.
But it was almost too late.
<P>
Suddenly a long roller lifted the brig well up into the air. Then it slid
down the watery incline. The cask started to roll toward the cabin windows.
Straight for them it came, turning over and over.
<P>
With a resounding blow the cask shattered the frame, and sent the glass in
a shower into the cabin below. Through the opening thus Providentially made,
the fresh air rushed. The deadly fumes began to escape. Once more the cask
rolled against the window, breaking another glass, and more fresh air came
in.
<P>
Jerry stirred uneasily. It seemed as if some one had a hammer, hitting him
on the head. That was the blood beginning to circulate again. His veins throbbed
with life. Slowly he opened his eyes. He became aware of a sweet, sickish
smell, that mingled with the sharp tang of the salt air. By a great effort
he roused himself. He could not, for a moment, think where he was, but he
had a dim feeling as if some one had tried to chloroform him. Then, with
a sudden shock his senses came back to him. He became aware of the need of
fresh air, and, hardly knowing what he was doing, he opened the cabin door.
<P>
The inrush of a fresh atmosphere completed the work the water cask had begun.
The poisonous fumes were dispersed, and, with their disappearance, the others
regained their senses. Mr. De Vere was the next to arouse.
<P>
"What&mdash;what happened?" he asked.
<P>
"I don't know," replied Jerry, "unless Blowitz came aboard and chloroformed
us."
<P>
"He couldn't do that&mdash;yet&mdash;the safe is not tampered with&mdash;but this drowsy
feeling&mdash;"
<P>
Mr. De Vere stopped suddenly. His eyes were fixed on the closet or locker,
whence the safe had been wheeled, and where the little boxes were. From the
locker a thin, bluish smoke arose.
<P>
"Quick!" he cried. "I understand it all now! We must get them overboard or
we'll all be killed!"
<P>
Ned and Bob had been aroused by this time, and were sitting staring stupidly
around them. They did not realize what had happened.
<P>
"I'll throw 'em overboard," volunteered Jerry.
<P>
"Don't go near them," cautioned Mr. De Vere. "If you breathe too deeply of
those fumes, you'll be killed. Get a boat hook, poke them out of the locker,
spear them with the sharp point, and thrust them up through the broken cabin
window."
<P>
Jerry hurried to the <I>Ripper, </I> which safely rode alongside the brig.
He got a sharp boat hook, and, with the aid of Bob and Ned, the boxes, with
their deadly contents were soon out on deck, whence they were knocked into
the sea. Then a hunt was made in other parts of the brig and more boxes were
found and cast into the ocean.
<P>
"What was in them?" asked Ned, when the task was finished. "Was that what
made us fall asleep?"
<P>
"It was," replied Mr. De Vere. "What was in them I do not know exactly, but
it was some chemical that Blowitz put there to accomplish his purpose. I
see through his scheme now. After the brig was loaded he sent these boxes
aboard. They were distributed in different parts of the ship, some in the
quarters of the crew, some where the mates slept, and others in the captain's
cabin. They were properly adjusted to give off a vapor at a certain time
and he counted either on the fumes killing the men, or making them unconscious
so they would die of heart failure. Then, very likely, he intended to make
a search for the brig which would have no captain or crew, and claim the
vessel. But his scheme did not work as he intended. The crew and captain
were probably frightened by feeling some mysterious sleepy influence at work,
and they hastily deserted the ship. Probably the commander did not like to
acknowledge the real reason for his seemingly un-called-for act, and he did
not tell Blowitz the cause for the abandonment. The stuff in the boxes remained
on board, ready to render unconscious any persons who came within reach of
the fumes. Maybe it made the dogs mad.
<P>
"The accidental closing of the cabin door deprived us of air. The fumes filled
the cabin, and rendered us all unconscious. I do not yet understand how we
were revived."
<P>
"It must have been the water cask," declared Jerry, who had seen it on deck,
and his theory, which was the correct one, was accepted.
<P>
"Now I will finish working the combination, and open the safe," said Mr.
De Vere, when they had breathed in deep of the fresh air, and felt the last
influences of the fumes vanish. "We must have been unconscious an hour or
more."
<P>
It did not take him long after this to open the strong box. From an inner
compartment he drew forth a bundle of papers, and a small box, that seemed
quite heavy. This he opened.
<P>
"The gold is safe, at any rate," he announced. "Now to look at the papers."
<P>
A hasty examination of these showed that they were all there.
<P>
"This is good news for me, boys," announced Mr. De Vere. "My fortune is safe
now, and that scoundrel Blowitz can not ruin me as he tried to do!"
<P>
"Hark! What was that?" asked Jerry suddenly.
<P>
From somewhere out on the Pacific there sounded a whistle, long drawn out.
<P>
"It's a steamer!" cried Ned. "It has probably sighted the derelict!"
<P>
"A steamer," murmured Mr. De Vere. "If it is not&mdash;"
<P>
He did not finish, but the boys knew what he meant.
<P>
Mr. De Vere hastily thrust the papers into an inner pocket of his coat.
<P>
"Distribute the gold among you," he told the boys. "When we get it aboard
the <I>Ripper</I> we can hide it. There is no telling what might happen.
If that steamer&mdash;"
<P>
"It's the tug <I>Monarch!"</I> cried Jerry, who had hurried up on deck. "It's
coming this way full speed!"
<P>
"Then we must leave at once!" decided Mr. De Vere. "I think our boat can
beat theirs. I did hope to be able to tow the brig into harbor, and save
the cargo, but that is out of the question now. I do not want a fight with
Blowitz. Come, boys, we must escape!"
<P>
The boys hurriedly divided the gold among them. It made their pockets bulge
out, and was quite heavy. Mr. De Vere had his papers safe.
<P>
As the derelict hunters all came out on deck they could see the
<I>Monarch</I> was much nearer. In bold relief stood a figure in the bow.
<P>
"It's Blowitz!" exclaimed Mr. De Vere, "and he's shaking his fist at me.
He's angry because I have beaten him at his own game. But come on, I don't
want a clash with him. I am in no shape for another fight. We'll have to
retreat."
<P>
It was the work of but a few seconds to get into the motor boat. The lines
were cast off, and, with one turn of the wheel Ned started the engine, and
ran her up to full speed after a few revolutions.
<P>
"Now let them have the brig," said Mr. De Vere. "I've gotten the best out
of her."
<P>
But Blowitz and his men seemed to have lost interest in the derelict. Instead
of continuing on their course toward it they were now coming full speed after
the <I>Ripper, </I> the tug being steered to cross her bows. Probably Blowitz
took it for granted that De Vere had the papers and gold.
<P>
"They're after us!" cried Jerry.
<P>
"Yes, but they've got to catch us!" declared Bob.
<P>
An instant later a puff of white smoke spurted out from the side of the
<I>Monarch, </I> something black jumped from wave-crest to wave-crest. Then
came a dull boom.
<P>
"What's that?" asked Bob, in alarm.
<P>
"A shot across our bows. A command to lay to," said Mr. De Vere.
<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>
<h4>THE END OF BLOWITZ&mdash;CONCLUSION</h4>
<P>
"ARE you going to stop?" asked Ned, of Maurice De Vere.
<P>
"Not unless you boys are afraid. I don't believe they can hit us. That's
only a small saluting cannon they have, and it's hard to shoot straight when
there's as much sea on as there is now. Do you want to stop and surrender?"
<P>
"Not much!" cried the three motor boys in a breath.
<P>
"Then may it be a stern chase and a long chase!" exclaimed Mr. De Vere. "Crowd
her all you can, Ned, and we'll beat him."
<P>
Ned needed no urging to make the powerful motor do its best. The machinery
was throbbing and humming, and the <I>Ripper</I> was cutting through the
water "with a bone in her teeth," as the sailors say.
<P>
"Swing her around so as to get the tug in back of us," advised Jerry. "We'll
be in less danger then."
<P>
Ned shifted the wheel, but, as he was doing so there was another shot from
the <I>Monarch, </I> and, this time, the ball from the cannon came uncomfortably
close.
<P>
"Their aim is improving," remarked Mr. De Vere, as he coolly looked at the
pursuing tug through the glasses, "but we are leaving them behind."
<P>
The chase had now become a "stern" one, that is the <I>Monarch</I> was directly
astern of the <I>Ripper, </I> and the varying progresses made by the boats
could not be discerned so well as before. Still it seemed that the motor
boat was maintaining her lead.
<P>
It now settled down to a pursuit, for, stern on as she was, the <I>Ripper</I>
offered so small a mark for the tug, that it was almost useless to fire the
cannon.
<P>
There were anxious hearts aboard the motor boat, as they watched the tug
pursuing them. They knew there would be a fight if Blowitz and Mr. De Vere
met, and, in the latter's crippled condition, it was not hard to imagine
how it would result.
<P>
"How's she running, Ned?" asked Jerry, as he looked at the engine.
<P>
"Never better. She's singing like a bird. This is a dandy boat."
<P>
"I think we'll beat him," declared Mr. De Vere.
<P>
For an hour or more the chase continued, the <I>Monarch</I> seeming to gain
slowly. Mr. De Vere looked anxious, and kept his eyes fixed to the binoculars,
through which he viewed the pursuing vessel. At length, however, a more cheerful
look came into his face.
<P>
"Something has happened!" he exclaimed.
<P>
"Happened? How?" asked Jerry.
<P>
"Why aboard the tug. Blowitz went off the deck in a hurry, and the steersman
has left the pilot house. Maybe something is wrong with the machinery."
<P>
That something of this nature had happened was evident a few minutes later,
for the <I>Monarch</I> had to slow up, and the <I>Ripper</I> was soon so
far in advance that to catch up with her was out of the question.
<P>
"I guess the chase is over," announced Mr. De Vere. "I think they've had
an accident. Still Blowitz will not give up. I must expect a legal battle
over this matter when I get ashore. He will try to ruin me, and claim these
papers and the gold. But I will beat him."
<P>
The <I>Ripper, </I> urged on by her powerful motor, soon lost sight of the
tug, which, from the last observation Mr. De Vere took, seemed to have turned
about, to go back to the brig.
<P>
Two days later, having made quick time, and on a straight course, the voyagers
sighted the harbor of San Felicity a few miles away.
<P>
"Now for home!" cried Ned.
<P>
"And the bungalow 'The Next Day,' Ponto and a good square meal!" added Bob.
<P>
"And the girls," came from Jerry. "I guess they'll be glad to see us."
<P>
"If Blowitz doesn't turn up to make trouble for me," put in Mr. De Vere,
rather dubiously.
<P>
The <I>Ripper</I> docked that afternoon, and, Mr. De Vere, promising to call
on the boys and pay them their prize money as soon as he had seen his lawyer,
and deposited the gold and papers in a safe place, bade them good-bye at
the wharf, and hurried off. He was fearful lest he should be intercepted
by some agent of Blowitz, though there was no sign that the tug had arrived.
<P>
The three boys were warmly welcomed by the girls and Mr. Seabury, when they
got to the bungalow.
<P>
"I congratulate you," said the elderly gentleman. "You deserve great credit
for what you did."
<P>
"Well, we had good luck," admitted Jerry. "But where is the professor?"
<P>
"Out searching for horned toads and web-footed lizards," said Nellie. "He
has enlisted the services of Ponto, and they are continually on the hunt.
I hope he gets what he wants."
<P>
"He generally does," said Bob. "If he doesn't he finds something else nearly
as good."
<P>
Some days later Mr. De Vere called at the bungalow. He had finished up his
business affairs, and brought the boys the prize money, as their reward for
the parts they had played in the finding of the derelict.
<P>
"But this is too much," protested Jerry, when Mr. De Vere had given him and
his comrades nearly half as much again as was originally promised.
<P>
"Not a bit of it," was the reply. "I can well afford it. Those papers were
more valuable than you supposed, and I find I will be able to collect insurance
on the cargo of the abandoned brig. I have heard from the captain of it,
and he tells me, just as I supposed, that he and the crew left her because
of the peculiar fumes, so that my theory was right, after all. They tried
to take the dogs, which belonged to the first mate, but could not."
<P>
"Did you hear anything more of Blowitz?" asked Ned.
<P>
"Yes," replied Mr. De Vere, rather solemnly. "Blowitz was killed shortly
after the tug gave up the chase."
<P>
"How?"
<P>
"The boiler blew up when the tug was trying to tow the derelict in, and he
and several of the crew were burned to death. The survivors floated on the
wreckage until they were picked up. So I have nothing more to fear from Blowitz.
But I called to know if you boys, and the young ladies, Mr. Seabury and Professor
Snodgrass, would not be my guests at a little dinner I am to give at the
hotel. I want to show you that I appreciate what you did for me."
<P>
"I think you have already done so," said Jerry.
<P>
"Perhaps I have, but I would like you to come to my dinner. Will you?"
<P>
The boys promised. So did the girls and Mr. Seabury, whose health was much
improved by the California climate. The professor, with a far away look in
his eyes, said he would be there if he could.
<P>
"What's to prevent you?" asked Bob.
<P>
"Well, I haven't found that horned toad yet, and I'm still searching."
<P>
The dinner came off three nights later. It was a grand affair, served in
the best of style of which the San Felicity hotel chef was capable. The girls
and the boys were there, dressed in their best, and Ponto was taken along
as a sort of chaperon, which gave him great delight. He did not once fall
asleep.
<P>
"But where is Professor Snodgrass?" asked Mr. De Vere, when it was nearly
time to sit down. "Isn't he coming?"
<P>
"He promised to be here," announced Mr. Seabury. "Probably he is on his way
now."
<P>
At that moment a commotion was heard outside the private dining-room which
Mr. De Vere had engaged. A voice was saying:
<P>
"I tell you I will go in! I'm invited! My clothes? What about my clothes?
All mud? Of course they're all mud. I couldn't help it!"
<P>
Then the door flew open and a curious sight was presented. There stood the
professor, his coat split up the back, his trousers torn, and his hat smashed.
Splashes of mud were all over him.
<P>
"What is the matter?" cried Mr. Seabury, in alarm.
<P>
"Nothing," replied the professor calmly. "I have caught two horned toads,
that's all. I saw them as I was on the way here, and I had to go into a mud
puddle to get them. I fell down, but I got the toads," and he held up a small
cage, in which were the ugly creatures.
<P>
"Ugh!" exclaimed Nellie.
<P>
"Good for you, Professor!" cried Jerry. "You got the toads and we got our
prize money!"
<P>
"Yes, but I would rather have these toads than all your prize money," replied
the professor. "They are beauties," he added, fondly.
<P>
The dinner was a joyous affair, and it is a question who was the happiest,
the professor, over the capture of the horned toads, the boys over the successful
outcome of their cruise on the Pacific, or Mr. De Vere, who had recovered
his fortune. At any rate they all had a good time.
<P>
"Well," remarked Bob, when the supper was over, and they were on their way
back to the bungalow, "I suppose we'll soon have to think of getting back
east, and beginning school. They must have the pipes and boiler fixed by
now."
<P>
"Don't think of it," begged Ned. "It's too awful. I'd like to go on another
long cruise in the <I>Ripper."</I>
<P>
"Well, I don't know that we can do that," said Jerry, "but I certainly hope
we have more adventures soon." How his wish was gratified will be told in
another volume of this series, to be entitled, "The Motor Boys in the Clouds;
Or, A Trip for Fame and Fortune." In that book we shall meet many of our
old friends again, and learn something more of a venture in which the motor
boys were already interested.
<P>
"Boys, this has been an interesting trip for me," said Professor Snodgrass.
"I have the two horned toads, seven web-footed lizards, and over fifty other
valuable specimens to take back with me. I would not have missed this trip
for a great deal."
<P>
"So say we all of us!" cried Jerry.
<P>
"Let us go out for another trip in the motor boat to-morrow," said Ned. "I
mean a short trip."
<P>
"Take us along!" pleaded the girls in concert.
<P>
"Sure thing!" answered the boys.
<P>
And they went out&mdash;and had a glorious time&mdash;and here we shall have to say
farewell.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net/pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
