Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple
editions,<br>
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States,
unless a<br>
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep
any<br>
of these books in compliance with any particular paper
edition.<br>
<br>
We are now trying to release all our books one year in
advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better
editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years
after<br>
the official publication date.<br>
<br>
Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final
till<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such
announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is
at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. 
A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion,
comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.<br>

announcement<br>
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this
is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as
the<br>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)<br>
<br>
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. 
The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty
hours<br>
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited,
copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. 
This<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our
value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce
$2<br>
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new
Etext<br>
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of
3000+<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the
total<br>
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's
end.<br>
<br>
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion
Etext<br>
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1
Trillion]<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million
readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer
users.<br>
<br>
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only
one-third<br>
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless
we<br>
manage to get some real funding.<br>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know:
lawyers.<br>
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong
with<br>
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from<br>
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br>
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement<br>
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you
how<br>
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.<br>
<br>
*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT<br>
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br>
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br>
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can
receive<br>
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by<br>
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the
person<br>
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical<br>
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your
request.<br>
<br>
ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etexts,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S.
Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States
copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.<br>
<br>
Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.<br>
<br>
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate
or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.<br>
<br>
LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES<br>
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,<br>
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you
may<br>
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext)
disclaims<br>
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses,
including<br>
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR<br>
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR
CONTRACT,<br>
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE<br>
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of<br>
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br>
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br>
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it<br>
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br>
such person may choose to alternatively give you a
replacement<br>
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may<br>
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br>
receive it electronically.<br>
<br>
THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER<br>
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU
AS<br>
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT<br>
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
<br>
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or<br>
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the<br>
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and
you<br>
may have other legal rights.<br>
<br>
INDEMNITY<br>
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,<br>
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated<br>
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm<br>
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense,

legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the<br>
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this
etext,<br>
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,<br>
or [3] any Defect.<br>
<br>
DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"<br>
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by<br>
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this<br>
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,<br>
or:<br>
<br>
[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this<br>
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the<br>
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may
however,<br>
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable<br>
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,<br>
     including any form resulting from conversion by word<br>
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as<br>

<br>
     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and<br>
          does *not* contain characters other than those<br>
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde<br>

          be used to convey punctuation intended by the<br>
          author, and additional characters may be used to<br>
          indicate hypertext links; OR<br>
<br>
     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at<br>
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent<br>

          OR<br>
<br>
     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at<br>
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the<br>

<br>
[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of
this<br>
     "Small Print!" statement.<br>
<br>
[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of
the<br>
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you<br>
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you<br>
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are<br>
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation"<br>
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were<br>
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent<br>
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to<br>
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.<br>

<p><font size="+1">I am making a much treasured copy of Songs of
the Ridings, F. W. Moorman, Elkin Mathews, Cork Street, London
1918. into etext so that it may enjoy a wider readership.   It is
out of Copyright. This Preface, and all minor changes made by me,
Dave Fawthrop, are hereby placed in the Public Domain.
Enjoy!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The book is a slim volume (70 pages) of 25
Yorkshire Dialect poems.  One of these "A Dalesman's Litany",
with slightly different wording, is much quoted in Yorkshire and
regularly sung in English folk clubs.  It is wrongly considered
as "Traditional" in the folk scene.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The book is rare in paper copies, and of great
interest to Yorkshire people with a bent towards the Yorkshire
Dialect.  As one who was born in Hull and lives in Halifax :-), I
am proud to be a Yorshireman</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In reading this one must remember that these
poems were written about 1900.  Moorman is describing a world
which is long forgotten and totally alien to a modern reader. 
His peasants no longer exist. Modern farmers would consider the
word an insult.  I can think of no acquaintance who would
consider him/her self an artisan.  In the hundred years which
have passed since then the Yorkshire dialect has changed quite
dramatically.  Even the English language has changed so much that
I had to look up several footnotes in the dictionary.   It has
been noted, rightly,  by several people from uk.local.yorkshire
that many words and pronunciations used are now only found in the
Geordie, Cumbrian, or Lowland Scots dialects.  Prof Moorman
clearly used the dialect as he heard it in about 1900,   These
must have been lost in Yorkshire over the last one hundred
years.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It will be archived in the Project Gutenberg 
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">http://www.gutenberg.net/</a>
when it is completed, but it is made available here parts become
available, in response to email requests.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There is a mass of, out of copyright,
Yorkshire Dialect prose and verse.  If you wish to make this
available to a wide audience, why not make some of it into
etext?   A good place to start searching is the Preface to F. W.
Moorman's Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673 -1915).   Just announce
what you are doing on uk.local.yorkshire, to avoid two people
doing the same work.  For more information on etext see
www.gutenberg.net.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Abut two years ago I published a collection of
Yorkshire dialect poems,  chosen from many authors and extending
over a period of two hundred and fifty years(1). The volume was
well received, and there are abundant signs that the interest in
dialect literature is steadily growing in all parts of the county
and beyond its borders. What is most encouraging is to find that
the book has found an entrance into the homes of Yorkshire
peasants and artisans where the works of our great national poets
are unknown. I now essay the more venturesome task of publishing
dialect verses of my own. Most of the poems contained in this
little volume have appeared, anonymously, in the Yorkshire press,
and I have now decided to reissue them in book form and with my
name on the title-page.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A generation ago the minor poet was, in the
eyes of most Englishmen, an object of ridicule. Dickens and
Thackeray had done their worst with him: we knew him--or her--as
Augustus Snodgrass or Blanche Amory--an amiable fool or an
unamiable minx. The twentieth century has already, in its short
course, done much to remove this prejudice, and the minor poet is
no longer expected to be apologetic; his circle of readers,
though small, is sympathetic, and the outside public is learning
to tolerate him and to recognise that it is as natural and
wholesome for him to write and publish his verses as it is for
the minor painter to depict and exhibit in public his
interpretation of the beauty and power which he sees in human
life and in nature. All this is clear gain, and the time may not
be far distant when England will again become what it was in
Elizabethan days - a nest of</font><br>
<font size="+1">singing birds, where te minor poets will be able
to take their share in the chorus of song, leaving the chief
parts in the oratorio to the Shakespeares and Spensers of
tomorrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The twenty-five poems of which this volume
consists are meant to serve a double purpose. Most of them are
character-sketches or dramatic studies, and my wish is to bring
before the notice of my readers the habits of mind of certain
Yorkshire men and women whose acquaintance I have made. For  ten
years I have gone up hill and down dale in the three Ridings,
intent on the study of the sounds, words and idioms of the local
folk-speech. At first my object was purely philological, but soon
I came to realise that men and women were more interesting than
words and phrases, and my attention was attracted from dialect
speech to dialect speakers. Among Yorkshire farmers, farm
labourers, fishermen, miners and mill workers I discovered a
vitality and an outlook upon life of which I, a bourgeois
professor, had no previous knowledge. Not, only had I never met
such men before, but I had not read about them in literature, or
seen their portraits painted on canvas. The wish to give a
literary interpretation of the world into which I had been
privileged to enter grew every day more insistent, and this
volume is the fulfilment of that wish.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Of all forms of literature, whether in Verse
or prose, the dramatic monologue seemed to me the aptest for the
exposition of character and habits of mind. It is the
creation--or recreation--of Robert Browning, the most
illuminating interpreter of the workings of the human mind that
England has produced since Shakespeare died. My first endeavour
was therefore</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">to watch</font><br>
<font size="+1">The Master work, and catch</font><br>
<font size="+1">Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's
true play.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been, I fear, a clumsy botcher in
applying the lessons that Browning was able to teach, but the
dramatic monologues of which this volume is largely composed owe
whatever art they may possess to his example. My dramatic studies
are drawn from life. For example, the local preacher who
expresses his views on the rival merits of Church and Chapel is a
Wharfedale acquaintance, and the farmer in 'Cambodunum' who
declares that "eddication's nowt but muckment" actually expressed
this view to a Chief Inspector of Schools, a member of the West
Riding Education Committee, and myself, when we visited him on
his farm. I do not claim that I have  furnished literal
transcripts of what I heard in my conversations with my heroes
and heroines, but my purpose throughout has been to hold a mirror
up to Nature, to give a faithful interpretation of thought and
character, and to show my readers some of the ply of mind and
habits of life that still prevail among Yorkshiremen whose
individuality has not been blunted by convention and who have the
courage to express their reasoned or instinctive views of life
and society.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But the interpretation of the minds of
Yorkshire peasants and artisans for the benefit of the so-called
general reader is only the secondary object which I have in view.
My primary appeal is not to those who have the full chorus of
English song, from Chaucer to Masefield, at their beck and call,
but to a still larger class of men and women who are not general
readers of literature at all, and for whom most English poetry is
a closed book. In my dialect wanderings through Yorkshire I
discovered that while there was a hunger for poetry in the hearts
of the people, the great masterpieces of our national song made
little or no appeal to them. They were bidden to a feast of
rarest quality and profusion, but it consisted of food that they
could not assimilate. Spenser, Milton, Pope, Keats, Tennyson, all
spoke to them in a language which they could not understand, and
presented to them a world of thought and life in which they had
no inheritance. But the Yorkshire dialect verse which circulated
through the</font><br>
<font size="+1">dales in chap-book or Christmas almanac was
welcomed everywhere. Two memories come before my mind as I write.
One is that of a North Riding farm labourer who knew by heart
many of the dialect poems of the Eskdale poet, John Castillo, and
was in the habit of reciting them to himself as he followed the
plough. The other is that of a blind girl in a West Riding
village who had committed to memory scores of the poems of John
Hartley, and, gathering her neighbours round her kitchen fire of
a winter evening, regaled them with 'Bite Bigger', 'Nelly 'o
Bob's' and other verses of the Halifax poet. My object is to add
something to this chorus of local song. It was the aim of Addison
in his 'Spectator' essays to bring "philosophy out of closets and
libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and
assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffeehouses"; and, in like
manner, it should be the aim of the writer of dialect verse to
bring poetry out of the coteries of the people of leisure and to
make it dwell in artisans' tenements and in cottagers' kitchens.
"Poetry," declared Shelley, "is the record of the best and
happiest moments of the happiest and best minds," and it is time
that the working men and women of England were made partakers in
this inheritance of wealth and joy.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It maybe argued that it should be the aim of
our schools and universities to educate the working classes to
appreciate what is best in standard English poetry. I do not deny
that much maybe done in this way, but let</font><br>
<font size="+1">us not forget that something more will be needed
than a course of instruction in poetic diction and metrical
rhythm. Our great poets depict a world which is only to a very
small extent that of the working man. It is a world of courts and
drawingrooms and General Headquarters, a world of clubs and
academies. The working man or woman finds a place in this charmed
world only if his occupation is that of a shepherd, and even then
he must be a shepherd of the Golden Age and answer to the name of
Corydon. Poets, we are solemnly assured by Pope, must not
describe shepherds as they really are, "but as they may be
conceived to have been when the best of men followed the
employment of shepherd."  Class-consciousness --a word often on
the lips of our democratic leaders of today--has held far too
much sway over the minds of poets from the Elizabethan age
onwards. Spenser writes his 'Faerie Queene' "to fashion a
gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline," and
Milton's audience, fit but few, is composed of scholars whose
ears have been attuned to the harmonies of epic verse from their
first lisping of Virgilian hexameters, or of latter-day Puritans,
like John Bright, who overhear in 'Paradise Lost' the echoes of a
faith that once was stalwart.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But what, it may be asked, of Crabbe, and what
of Wordsworth? The former by his own confession,
paints</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">the cot,</font><br>
<font size="+1">As truth will paint it and as bards will
not;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">but as we listen to his verse tales we can
never forget that it is the Rev. George Crabbe who is instructing
us, or that his pedestal is the topmost story of his three-decker
pulpit at Aldborough. Wordsworth's sympathy with the lives of the
Cumberland peasantry is profound, and the time is surely not
distant when such a poem as 'Michael' will win a place in the
hearts of working men; but it is to be feared that in his own
generation "Mr Wudsworth" served rather--as a warning than an
encouragement to his peasant neighbours. "Many's the time," an
old</font><br>
<font size="+1">Cumberland innkeeper told Canon Rawnsley, "I've
seed him a-takin' his family out in a string, and niver geein'
the deariest bit of notice to 'em; standin' by hissel' an'
stoppin' behind a-gapin', wi' his jaws workin' the whoal time;
but niver no crackin' wi' 'em, nor no pleasure in 'em--a
desolate-minded man, ye kna... It was potry as did
it."(2)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Our English non-dramatic poetry from the
Renaissance onwards is second to none in richness of thought and
beauty of diction, but it lacks the  highest quality of
all--universality of interest and appeal. Our poets have turned a
cold shoulder to the activities and aims of the working man, and
the working man has, in consequence, turned a cold shoulder to
the great English classic poets. The loss on either side has been
great, though it is only now beginning to be realised. "A
literature which leaves large areas of the national activity and
aspiration unexpressed is in danger of becoming narrow, esoteric,
unhealthy. Areas of activity and aspiration unlit by the
cleansing sun of art, untended by the loving consideration of the
poet, will be dungeons for the national spirit, mildewed cellars
in which rats fight, misers hoard their gold, and Guy Fawkes lays
his train to blow the superstructure sky-high."(3)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There was a time when poetry meant much more
to the working men of England. In the later Middle Ages, above
all in that fifteenth century which literary historians are fond
of describing as the darkest period in English literature, the
working man had won for himself what seemed a secure place in
poetry. Narrative, lyric and dramatic poetry had all opened their
portals to him, and made his life and aims their theme. Side by
side with the courtly verse romances, which were read in the
bowers of highborn ladies, were the terse and popular ballads,
which were chanted by minstrels, wandering from town to town and
from village to village. Among the heroes of these ballads we
find that "wight yeoman," Robin Hood, who wages war against
mediaeval capitalism, as embodied in the persons of the
abbot-landholders, and against the class legislation of Norman
game laws which is enforced by the King's sheriff. The lyric
poetry of the century is not the courtly Troubadour song or the
Petrarchian sonnet, but the folk-song that sings from the heart
to the heart of the beauty of Alysoun, "seemliest of all things,"
or, in more convivial mood, accounts good ale of more worth than
a table set with many dishes:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Bring us in no capon's flesh, for that is
often dear,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Nor bring us in no duck's flesh, for they slobber
in the mere,</font><br>
<font size="+1">But bring us in good ale!</font><br>
<font size="+1">Bring us in good ale, and bring us in good
ale;</font><br>
<font size="+1">For our blessed Lady sake bring us in good
ale.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Most remarkable of all is the history of the
drama in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The drama was
clerical and not popular in its origin, and when, in course of
time, it passed out of the hands of the clergy it is natural to
suppose that it would find a new home at the King's court or the
baron's castle. It did nothing of the kind. It passed from the
Church to the people, and it was the artisan craftsmen of the
English towns, organised in their trade-guilds, to whom we owe
the great cycles of our miracle plays. The authors of these plays
were restricted to Bible story for their themes, but the popular
character of their work is everywhere apparent in the manner in
which the material is handled and the characters conceived. The
Noah of the Deluge plays is an English master joiner with a
shrewish wife, and three sons who are his apprentices. When the
divine command to build an ark comes to him, he sets to work with
an energy that drives away "the weariness of five hundred
winters" and, "ligging on his line," measures his planks,
"clenches them with noble new nails", and takes a craftsman's
delight in the finished work:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This work I warant both good and
true.(4)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In like manner, the Shepherds of the Nativity
plays are conceived and  fashioned by men who, fortunate in that
they knew nothing of the seductions of Arcadian pastoralism, have
studied at first hand the habits and thoughts of English
fifteenth-century shepherds, and paint these to the
life.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus, at the close of the Middle Ages,
narrative, lyric and dramatic poetry seemed firmly established
among the people. Not unmindful of romance, it was grounded in
realism and sought to interpret the life of  the peasant and the
artisan of fifteenth-century England. The Renaissance follows,
and a profound change comes over poetry. The popular note grows
fainter and fainter, till at last it becomes inaudible. Poetry
leaves the farmyard and the craftsman's bench for the court. The
folk-song, fashioned in to a thing of wondrous beauty by the
creator of Amiens, Feste and Autolycus, is driven from the stage
by Ben Jonson, and its place is taken by a lyric of classic
extraction. The popular drama, ennobled and made shapely through
contact with Latin drama, passes from the provincial market-place
to Bankside, and the rude mechanicals of the trade-guilds yield
place to the Lord Chamberlain's players. In the dramas of
Shakespeare the popular note is still audible, but only as an
undertone, furnishing comic relief to the romantic amours of
courtly lovers or the tragic fall of Princes; with Beaumont and
Fletcher, and still more with Dryden and the Restoration
dramatists, the popular element in the drama passes away, and the
triumph of the court is complete. The Elizabethan court could
find no use for the popular ballad, but, like other forms of
literature, it was attracted from the country-side to the city.
Forgetful of the greenwood, it now battened on the garbage of
Newgate, and 'Robin Hood and Guy of Gisburn' yields place to 'The
Wofull Lamentation of William Purchas, who for murthering his
Mother at Thaxted, was executed at Chelmsford'.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We are justly proud of the Renaissance and of
the glories of our Elizabethan literature, but let us frankly own
that in the annals of poetry there was loss as well as gain. The
gain was for the courtier and the scholar, and for all those who,
in the centuries that followed the Renaissance, have been able,
by means of education, to enter into the</font><br>
<font size="+1">courtier's and scholar's inheritance. The loss
has been for the people.  The opposition between courtly taste
and popular taste is hard to analyse, but we have only to turn
our eyes from England to Scotland, which lost its</font><br>
<font size="+1">royal court in 1603, in order to appreciate the
reality of the opposition. In Scotland the courtly poetry of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries soon disappeared when James I
exchanged Holyrood for Whitehall, but popular poetry continued to
live and grow. The folk-song gathered power and sweetness all
through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, till it
culminated at last in the lyric of Burns. Popular drama, never
firmly rooted in Scotland, was stamped out by the Reformation,
but the popular ballad outlived the mediaeval minstrel, was kept
alive in the</font><br>
<font size="+1">homes of Lowland farmers and shepherds, and
called into being the great ballad revival of the nineteenth
century.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is idle to speculate what would have been
the progress of poetry in England if the Renaissance had not come
and the Elizabethan courtier had not enriched himself at the
expense of the people. What we have to bear in mind is that all
through the centuries that followed the Renaissance the working
men and women of England looked almost in vain to their poets for
a faithful interpretation of their life and aims. The wonder is
that the instinct for poetry did not perish in their hearts for
lack of sustenance.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There are at the present time clear signs of a
revival of popular poetry and popular drama. The verse tales of
Masefield and Gibson, the lyrics of Patrick MacGill, the peasant
or artisan plays which have been produced at</font><br>
<font size="+1">the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and the Gaiety
Theatre, Manchester, may well be the beginning of a great
democratic literary movement. Democracy, in its striving after a
richer and fuller life for the people of England, is at last
turning its attention to literature and art. It is slowly
realising two great truths. The first is that literature may be
used as a mighty weapon in the furtherance of political justice
and social reform, and that the pied pipers of folk-song have the
power to rouse the nation and charm the ears of even the Mother
of Parliaments. The second is that the working man needs
something more to sustain him than bread and the franchise and a
fair day's wage for a fair day's work. Democracy, having obtained
for the working man a place in the government of the nation, is
now asserting his claim to a place in the temples of poetry. The
Arthurian knight, the Renaissance courtier, the scholar and the
wit must admit the twentieth-century artisan to their circle.
Piers the ploughman must once more become the hero of song, and
Saul Kane, the poacher, must find a place, alongside of Tiresias
and Merlin, among the seers and mystics. Let democracy look to
William Morris, poet, artist and social democrat, for inspiration
and guidance, and take to heart the message of prophecy which he
has left us: "If art, which is now sick, is to live and not die,
it must in the future be of the people, for the people,  by the
people."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In the creation of this poetry "of the people,
by the people" dialect may well be called upon to play a part.
Dialect is of the people, though in a varying degree in the
different parts of the wide areas of the globe where</font><br>
<font size="+1">the English language is spoken; it possesses,
moreover, qualities, and is fraught with associations, which are
of the utmost value to the poet and to which the standard speech
can lay no claim. It may be that for some of the more elaborate
kinds of poetry, such as the formal epic, dialect is useless; let
it be reserved, therefore, for those kinds which appeal most
directly to the hearts of the people. The poetry of the people
includes the ballad and the verse tale, lyric in all its forms,
and some kinds of satire; and for all these dialect is a fitting
instrument. It possesses</font><br>
<font size="+1">in the highest degree directness of utterance and
racy vigour. How much of their force would the "Biglow Papers" of
J. R. Lowell lose if they were transcribed from the Yankee
dialect into standard English!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But the highest quality of dialect speech, and
that which renders it pre-eminently fitted for poetic use, is its
intimate association with all that lies nearest to the heart of
the working man. It is the language of his hearth and home; many
of the most cherished memories of his life are bound up with it;
it is for him the language of freedom, whereas standard English
is that of constraint. In other words, dialect is the working
man's poetic diction--a poetic diction as full of savour as that
of the eighteenth-century poets was flat and insipid.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is sometimes said that the use of dialect
makes the appeal of poetry provincial instead of national or
universal. This is only true when the dialect poet is a pedant
and obscures his meaning by fantastic spellings.  The Lowland
Scots element in 'Auld Lang Syne' has not prevented it from
becoming the song of friendship of the Anglo-Saxon race all the
world over. Moreover, the provincial note in poetry or prose is
far from being a bad thing. In the 'Idylls' of Theocritus it gave
new life to Greek poetry in the third century before Christ, and
it may render the same high service to English poetry to-day or
to-morow. The rise of Provincial schools of literature,
interpreting local life in local idiom, in all parts of the
British Isles and in the Britain beyond the seas, is a goal worth
striving for; such a literature, so far from impeding the
progress of the literature in the standard tongue, would serve
only to enrich it in spirit, substance and form.</font></p>

<font size="+1">Slowly fluttered and fell.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Her heart stood still a moment,</font><br>
<font size="+1">As the last leaf touched the ground;</font><br>
<font size="+1">And her hand went swift to her maiden
breast,</font><br>
<font size="+1">For she heard a far-off sound;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">'Twas the sound of a horseman
spurring</font><br>
<font size="+1">His steed through the woodland glade;</font><br>
<font size="+1">And ever the sound drew nearer,</font><br>
<font size="+1">And the footfalls echoed clearer,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Till before her bower they stayed.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">She strained her eyes to discover,</font><br>
<font size="+1">By the light of a ghostly moon,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Who was the knight had heard and
obeyed</font><br>
<font size="+1">The hest of the mystic rune.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But naught could she see from her
casement,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Save a man on a coal-black steed;</font><br>
<font size="+1">For his mantle was muffled about him,</font><br>
<font size="+1">His blazon she could not read.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">She crossed herself and she
whispered--</font><br>
<font size="+1">Her voice was faint but clear--</font><br>
<font size="+1">"Oh! Who art thou that darest ride,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Through the aspen glade, by the river's
side,</font><br>
<font size="+1">My chamber window near?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Say, art thou the lord of
Bainbridge,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Or Gervase of Bolton Hall,</font><br>
<font size="+1">That comest so late on St Agnes Eve</font><br>
<font size="+1">Within my manor wall?"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"I am not the lord of Bainbridge,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Nor Gervase of Bolton Hall,</font><br>
<font size="+1">But I marked the light in thy
casement,</font><br>
<font size="+1">And I saw the sage-leaves fall,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Flutter awhile and fall."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Camest thou over the moorlands,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Or camest thou through the dale?</font><br>
<font size="+1">Speak no guile to a witless maid,</font><br>
<font size="+1">But tell me a soothfast tale."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"I came not over the moorlands,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Nor along the dale did ride;</font><br>
<font size="+1">But thou seeest thy plighted lover,</font><br>
<font size="+1">That has come to claim his bride."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Say, art thou knight or yeoman,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Of noble or simple birth?</font><br>
<font size="+1">Fain would I know thy lineage,</font><br>
<font size="+1">Thy prowess and thy worth."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Nor knight nor lowly yeoman,</font><br>
<font size="+1">But a mighty king am I;</font><br>
<font size="+1">Bold vassals do my bidding,</font><br>
<font size="+1">And on mine errands hie.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"They come to court and castle,</font><br>
<font size="+1">They climb the palace stairs;</font><br>
<font size="+1">Nor pope nor king may entrance bar</font><br>
<font size="+1">To him my livery wears."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"But why should a king so mighty</font><br>
<font size="+1">Pay court to a simple maid?</font><br>
<font size="+1">My father's a knight of low degree,</font><br>
<font size="+1">No princely realm he holds in fee,</font><br>
<font size="+1">No proud-foot damsels wait on me:</font><br>
<font size="+1">Thy steps have surely strayed."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"No step of mine hath wandered</font><br>
<font size="+1">From the goal of my desires;</font><br>
<font size="+1">'Tis on thee my hopes are centred,</font><br>
<font size="+1">'Tis to thee my heart aspires.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"I love thee for thy beauty,</font><br>
<font size="+1">I love thee for thy grace,</font><br>
<font size="+1">I love thee for the dancing lights</font><br>
<font size="+1">That gleam in thy moon-lit face:</font><br>
<font size="+1">And these I deem a peerless dower</font><br>
<font size="+1">To win a king's embrace."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"One boon, O royal lover,</font><br>
<font size="+1">I ask on St Agnes Day;</font><br>
<font size="+1">I fain would gaze on thy visage fair</font><br>
<font size="+1">Ere with thee I steal away.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"Unmuffle thou the mantle</font><br>
<font size="+1">That hides thee like a pall;</font><br>
<font size="+1">And let the purple trappings</font><br>
<font size="+1">From off thy shoulders fall."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Slowly he loosed the mantle,</font><br>
<font size="+1">And showed his face beneath.</font><br>
<font size="+1">The lights went out in the maiden's
eyes;</font><br>
<font size="+1">One swooning word she breathed to the
skies:</font><br>
<font size="+1">The gaunt hills echoed "Death."</font><br>
