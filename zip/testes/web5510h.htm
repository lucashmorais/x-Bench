<h1>
Paul's Second Letter to Timothy
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus
Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which
is in Christ Jesus,  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> to
Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<p> <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> I thank God, whom I
serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my
memory of you in my petitions, night and day  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> longing to see you, remembering
your tears, that I may be filled with joy;  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> having been reminded of the
unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother
Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> For this cause, I
remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through
the laying on of my hands.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> For God didn't give us a spirit of
fear, but of power, love, and self-control.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Therefore don't be ashamed of the
testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the
Good News according to the power of God,  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> who saved us and called us with a
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose
and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
 <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> but has now been revealed
by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and
brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> For this, I was appointed as a
preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> For this cause I also suffer
these things.
<p>Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
against that day.
<p> <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Hold the pattern of
sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in
Christ Jesus.  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> That good
thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells
in us.
<p> <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> This you know, that
all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and
Hermogenes.  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> May the Lord
grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and
was not ashamed of my chain,  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> but when he was in Rome, he
sought me diligently, and found me  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> (the Lord grant to him to find
the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at
Ephesus, you know very well.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> You therefore, my
child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> The things which you have heard
from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be
able to teach others also.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> You therefore must endure
hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> No soldier on duty entangles
himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as
a soldier.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Also, if anyone
competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the
rules.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The farmers who
labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> Consider what I say, and may the
Lord give you understanding in all things.
<p> <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> Remember Jesus Christ,
risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,
 <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> in which I suffer hardship
to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.
 <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> Therefore I endure all
things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation
which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> This saying is faithful:
<dl>
<dt>&quot;For if we died with him,
<dd>we will also live with him.
<dt> <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> If we endure,
<dd>we will also reign with him.
<dt>If we deny him,
<dd>he also will deny us.
<dt> <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> If we are faithless,
<dd>he remains faithful.
<dd>He can't deny himself.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Remind them of these
things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue
about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.
<p> <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> Give diligence to
present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be
ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.  <a name="C2V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:16</font></a> But shun empty chatter, for they
will proceed further in ungodliness,  <a name="C2V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:17</font></a> and their word will consume like
gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;  <a name="C2V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:18</font></a> men who have erred concerning the
truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the
faith of some.  <a name="C2V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:19</font></a> However
God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, &quot;The Lord knows those
who are his,&quot;<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font> and, &quot;Let every one who names the name
of <a href="#N2">the Lord</a> depart from unrighteousness.&quot;  <a name="C2V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:20</font></a> Now in a large house there are
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some
are for honor, and some for dishonor.  <a name="C2V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:21</font></a> If anyone therefore purges
himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and
suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.
<p> <a name="C2V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:22</font></a> Flee from youthful
lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who
call on the Lord out of a pure heart.  <a name="C2V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:23</font></a> But refuse foolish and ignorant
questionings, knowing that they generate strife.  <a name="C2V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:24</font></a> The Lord's servant must not
quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,  <a name="C2V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:25</font></a> in gentleness correcting those
who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full
knowledge of the truth,  <a name="C2V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:26</font></a> and they may recover themselves
out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> But know this, that in
the last days, grievous times will come.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> For men will be lovers of self,
lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> without natural affection,
unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
 <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> traitors, headstrong,
conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> holding a form of godliness, but
having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> For of these are those who creep
into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led
away by various lusts,  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> always learning, and never able to
come to the knowledge of the truth.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed
Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate
concerning the faith.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> But
they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men,
as theirs also came to be.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> But you did follow my teaching,
conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> persecutions, and sufferings:
those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I
endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Yes, and all who desire to live
godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> But evil men and impostors will
grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> But you remain in the things
which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you
have learned them.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> From
infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you
wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> Every writing <a
href="#N3">inspired by God</a> is profitable for teaching, for reproof,
for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> that the man of God may be
complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> I command you therefore
before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the
dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:  <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> preach the word; be urgent in
season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience
and teaching.  <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> For the time
will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having
itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
 <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> and will turn away their
ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.  <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> But you be sober in all things,
suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
<p> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> For I am already being
offered, and the time of my departure has come.  <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> I have fought the good fight. I
have finished the course. I have kept the faith.  <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> From now on, there is stored up
for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who
have loved his appearing.  <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> Be diligent to come to me soon,
 <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> for Demas left me, having
loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia,
and Titus to Dalmatia.  <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark,
and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.  <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
 <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> Bring the cloak that I
left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the
parchments.  <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> Alexander,
the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to
his works,  <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> of whom you
also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
<p> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> At my first defense,
no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.
 <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> But the Lord stood by me,
and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully
proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out
of the mouth of the lion.  <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> And the Lord will deliver me from
every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be
the glory forever and ever. Amen.
<p> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> Greet Prisca and
Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.  <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Erastus remained at Corinth, but
I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.  <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Be diligent to come before
winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the
brothers.  <a name="C4V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:22</font></a> The Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth<br>
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook<br>
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
