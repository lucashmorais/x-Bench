<h1>Book 08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruth</h1>

<p>08:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wife, and his two sons.</p>

<p>08:001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Moab, and continued there.</p>

<p>08:001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two sons.</p>

<p>08:001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelled there about ten years.</p>

<p>08:001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was left of her two sons and her husband.</p>

<p>08:001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giving them bread.</p>

<p>08:001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return unto the land of Judah.</p>

<p>08:001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have dealt with the dead, and with me.</p>

<p>08:001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their voice, and wept.</p>

<p>08:001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy people.</p>

<p>08:001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your husbands?</p>

<p>08:001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</p>

<p>08:001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone out against me.</p>

<p>08:001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</p>

<p>08:001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law.</p>

<p>08:001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, and thy God my God:</p>

<p>08:001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and me.</p>

<p>08:001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then she left speaking unto her.</p>

<p>08:001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</p>

<p>08:001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</p>

<p>08:001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</p>

<p>08:001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>

<p>08:002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</p>

<p>08:002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</p>

<p>08:002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>

<p>08:002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bless thee.</p>

<p>08:002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose damsel is this?</p>

<p>08:002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the country of Moab:</p>

<p>08:002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house.</p>

<p>08:002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide here fast by my maidens:</p>

<p>08:002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</p>

<p>08:002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</p>

<p>08:002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>

<p>08:002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust.</p>

<p>08:002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine handmaidens.</p>

<p>08:002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</p>

<p>08:002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproach her not:</p>

<p>08:002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</p>

<p>08:002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</p>

<p>08:002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</p>

<p>08:002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to day is Boaz.</p>

<p>08:002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, one of our next kinsmen.</p>

<p>08:002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest.</p>

<p>08:002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee not in any other field.</p>

<p>08:002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother in law.</p>

<p>08:003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</p>

<p>08:003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshingfloor.</p>

<p>08:003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drinking.</p>

<p>08:003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt do.</p>

<p>08:003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p>

<p>08:003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that her mother in law bade her.</p>

<p>08:003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</p>

<p>08:003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</p>

<p>08:003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou art a near kinsman.</p>

<p>08:003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor or rich.</p>

<p>08:003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou art a virtuous woman.</p>

<p>08:003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a kinsman nearer than I.</p>

<p>08:003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</p>

<p>08:003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known that a woman came into the floor.</p>

<p>08:003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</p>

<p>08:003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her.</p>

<p>08:003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>

<p>08:003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have finished the thing this day.</p>

<p>08:004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aside, and sat down.</p>

<p>08:004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye down here. And they sat down.</p>

<p>08:004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother Elimelech's:</p>

<p>08:004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>08:004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inheritance.</p>

<p>08:004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot redeem it.</p>

<p>08:004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this was a testimony in Israel.</p>

<p>08:004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drew off his shoe.</p>

<p>08:004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of Naomi.</p>

<p>08:004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;witnesses this day.</p>

<p>08:004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be famous in Bethlehem:</p>

<p>08:004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young woman.</p>

<p>08:004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p>

<p>08:004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;famous in Israel.</p>

<p>08:004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born him.</p>

<p>08:004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nurse unto it.</p>

<p>08:004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>

<p>08:004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>

<p>08:004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</p>

<p>08:004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>

<p>08:004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>

<p>08:004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE, KING JAMES, B8 ***

****** This file should be named bib0810h.htm or bib0810h.zip ******

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, bib0811h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, bib0810ah.htm

This eBook was produced by David Widger
Additional credits are noted in the header.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
