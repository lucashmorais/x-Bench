<h1>
Zephaniah
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> The word of Yahweh which
came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of
Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king
of Judah.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> I will utterly
sweep away everything off of the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.
 <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> I will sweep away man and
animal. I will sweep away the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and
the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I will cut off man from the surface
of the earth, says Yahweh.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> I will stretch out my hand against
Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the
remnant of Baal from this place: the name of the idolatrous and pagan
priests,  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> those who worship
the army of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by
Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,  <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> those who have turned back from
following Yahweh, and those who haven't sought Yahweh nor inquired after
him.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Be silent at the
presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh
has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests.  <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> It will happen in the day of
Yahweh's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, the king's sons, and
all those who are clothed with foreign clothing.  <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> In that day, I will punish all
those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with
violence and deceit.  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> In
that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry from the fish
gate, a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the
hills.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> Wail, you
inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone! All those
who were loaded with silver are cut off.  <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> It will happen at that time, that
I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are
settled on their dregs, who say in their heart, &quot;Yahweh will not do
good, neither will he do evil.&quot;  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> Their wealth will become a spoil,
and their houses a desolation. Yes, they will build houses, but won't
inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, but won't drink their wine.
 <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> The great day of Yahweh
is near. It is near, and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh.
The mighty man cries there bitterly.  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> That day is a day of wrath, a day
of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and
gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,  <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> a day of the trumpet and alarm,
against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.  <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> I will bring distress on men,
that they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against
Yahweh, and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like
dung.  <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> Neither their
silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh's
wrath, but the whole land will be devoured by the fire of his jealousy;
for he will make an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in
the land.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Gather yourselves
together, yes, gather together, you nation that has no shame,  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> before the appointed time when the
day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you,
before the day of Yahweh's anger comes on you.  <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the
land, who have kept his ordinances. Seek righteousness. Seek humility. It
may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh's anger.  <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> For Gaza will be forsaken, and
Ashkelon a desolation. They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron
will be rooted up.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> Woe to
the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word
of Yahweh is against you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will
destroy you, that there will be no inhabitant.  <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> The sea coast will be pastures,
with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.  <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> The coast will be for the remnant
of the house of Judah. They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon,
they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God, will visit them,
and restore them.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> I have
heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, with
which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against
their border.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Therefore as
I live, says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be as
Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and
salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of my people will
plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.  <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> This they will have for their
pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the
people of Yahweh of Armies.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Yahweh will be awesome to them,
for he will famish all the gods of the land. Men will worship him,
everyone from his place, even all the shores of the nations.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> You Cushites also, you will be
killed by my sword.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> He
will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria, and will
make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.  <a name="C2V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:14</font></a> Herds will lie down in the midst
of her, all the animals of the nations. Both the pelican and the porcupine
will lodge in its capitals. Their calls will echo through the windows.
Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare the cedar
beams.  <a name="C2V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:15</font></a> This is the joyous
city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, &quot;I am, and there
is none besides me.&quot; How she has become a desolation, a place for
animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake
their fists.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> Woe to her who is
rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> She didn't obey the voice. She
didn't receive correction. She didn't trust in Yahweh. She didn't draw
near to her God.  <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> Her
princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening
wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.  <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Her prophets are arrogant and
treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have
done violence to the law.  <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Yahweh, in the midst of her, is
righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to
light. He doesn't fail, but the unjust know no shame.  <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> I have cut off nations. Their
battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one
passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that
there is no inhabitant.  <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> I
said, &quot;Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won't
be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.&quot;
But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.  <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> &quot;Therefore wait for me,&quot;
says Yahweh, &quot;until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my
determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms,
to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the
earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.  <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> For then I will purify the lips of
the peoples, that they may all call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him
shoulder to shoulder.  <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> From beyond the rivers of Cush,
my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my
offering.  <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> In that day you
will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have
transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of you
your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy
mountain.  <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> But I will
leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take
refuge in the name of Yahweh.  <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> The remnant of Israel will not do
iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in
their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them
afraid.&quot;
<p> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> Sing, daughter of
Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of
Jerusalem.  <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> Yahweh has
taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of
Israel, Yahweh, is in the midst of you. You will not be afraid of evil any
more.  <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> In that day, it
will be said to Jerusalem, &quot;Don't be afraid, Zion. Don't let your
hands be slack.&quot;  <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> Yahweh, your God, is in the midst
of you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He
will rest in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.  <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> Those who are sad for the
appointed feasts, I will remove from you. They are a burden and a reproach
to you.  <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> Behold, at that
time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who
are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise
and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.  <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> At that time will I bring you in,
and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise
among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity
before your eyes, says Yahweh.

<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK The World English Bible (WEB): Zephaniah ***</p>

<p>This file should be named web3610h.htm or web3610h.zip<br>
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, web3611h.htm<br>
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web3610ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>
