<b>OUR PROTIST ANCESTORS</b></center>

<br>
 

<p class="one">Under the guidance of the biogenetic law, and on the
basis of the evidence we have obtained, we now turn to the
interesting task of determining the series of man&rsquo;s animal
ancestors. Phylogeny us a whole is an inductive science. From the
totality of the biological processes in the life of plants,
animals, and man we have gathered a confident inductive idea that
the whole organic population of our planet has been moulded on a
harmonious law of evolution. All the interesting phenomena that we
meet in ontogeny and paleontology, comparative anatomy and
dysteleology, the distribution and habits of organisms&mdash;all
the important general laws that we abstract from the phenomena of
these sciences, and combine in harmonious unity&mdash;are the broad
bases of our great biological induction.</p>

<p>But when we come to the application of this law, and seek to
determine with its aid the origin of the various species of
organisms, we are compelled to frame</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 208">[ 208 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">hypotheses that have essentially a <i>deductive</i>
character, and are inferences from the general law to particular
cases. But these special deductions are just as much justified and
necessitated by the rigorous laws of logic as the inductive
conclusions on which the whole theory of evolution is built. The
doctrine of the animal ancestry of the human race is a special
deduction of this kind, and follows with logical necessity from the
general inductive law of evolution.</p>

<p>I must point out at once, however, that the certainty of these
evolutionary hypotheses, which rest on clear special deductions, is
not always equally strong. Some of these inferences are now beyond
question; in the case of others it depends on the knowledge and the
competence of the inquirer what degree of certainty he attributes
to them. In any case, we must distinguish between the <i>
absolute</i> certainty of the general (inductive) theory of descent
and the <i>relative</i> certainty of special (deductive)
evolutionary hypotheses. We can never determine the whole ancestral
series of an organism with the same confidence with which we hold
the general theory of evolution as the sole scientific explanation
of organic modifications. The special indication of stem-forms in
detail will always be more or less incomplete and hypothetical.
This is quite natural. The evidence on which we build is imperfect,
and always will be imperfect; just as in comparative philology.</p>

<p>The first of our documents, paleontology, is exceedingly
incomplete. We know that all the fossils yet discovered are only an
insignificant fraction of the plants and animals that have lived on
our planet. For every single species that has been preserved for us
in the rocks there are probably hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
extinct species that have left no trace behind them. This extreme
and very unfortunate incompleteness of the paleontological
evidence, which cannot be pointed out too often, is easily
explained. It is absolutely inevitable in the circumstances of the
fossilisation of organisms. It is also due in part to the
incompleteness of our knowledge in this branch. It must be borne in
mind that the great majority of the stratified rocks that compose
the crust of the earth have not yet been opened. We have only a few
specimens of the innumerable fossils that are buried in the vast
mountain ranges of Asia and Africa. Only a part of Europe and North
America has been investigated carefully. The whole of the fossils
known to us certainly do not amount to a hundredth part of the
remains that are really buried in the crust of the earth. We may,
therefore, look forward to a rich harvest in the future as regards
this science. However, our paleontological evidence will (for
reasons that I have fully explained in the sixteenth chapter of the
<i>History of Creation</i>) always be defective.</p>

<p>The second chief source of evidence, ontogeny, is not less
incomplete. It is the most important source of all for special
phylogeny; but it has great defects, and often fails us. We must,
above all, clearly distinguish between palingenetic and cenogenetic
phenomena. We must never forget that the laws of curtailed and
disturbed heredity often make the original course of development
almost unrecognisable. The recapitulation of phylogeny by ontogeny
is only fairly complete in a few cases, and is never wholly
complete. As a rule, it is precisely the earliest and most
important embryonic stages that suffer most from alteration and
condensation. The earlier embryonic forms have had to adapt
themselves to new circumstances, and so have been modified. The
struggle for existence has had just as profound an influence on the
freely moving and still immature young forms as on the adult forms.
Hence in the embryology of the higher animals, especially,
palingenesis is much restricted by cenogenesis; it is to-day, as a
rule, only a faded and much altered picture of the original
evolution of the animal&rsquo;s ancestors. We can only draw
conclusions from the embryonic forms to the stem-history with the
greatest caution and discrimination. Moreover, the embryonic
development itself has only been fully studied in a few
species.</p>

<p>Finally, the third and most valuable source of evidence,
comparative anatomy, is also, unfortunately, very imperfect; for
the simple reason that the whole of the living species of animals
are a mere fraction of the vast population that has dwelt on our
planet since the beginning of life. We may confidently put the
total number of these at more than a million species. The number of
animals whose organisation has been studied up to the present in
comparative anatomy is proportionately very small. Here, again,
future research will yield incalculable treasures.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 209">[ 209 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">But, for the present, in view of this patent
incompleteness of our chief sources of evidence, we must naturally
be careful not to lay too much stress in human phylogeny on the
particular animals we have studied, or regard all the various
stages of development with equal confidence as stem-forms.</p>

<p>In my first efforts to construct the series of man&rsquo;s
ancestors I drew up a list of, at first ten, afterwards twenty to
thirty, forms that may be regarded more or less certainly as animal
ancestors of the human race, or as stages that in a sense mark off
the chief sections in the long story of evolution from the
unicellular organism to man. Of these twenty to thirty stages, ten
to twelve belong to the older group of the Invertebrates and
eighteen to twenty to the younger division of the Vertebrates.</p>

<p>In approaching, now, the difficult task of establishing the
evolutionary succession of these thirty ancestors of humanity since
the beginning of life, and in venturing to lift the veil that
covers the earliest secrets of the earth&rsquo;s history, we must
undoubtedly look for the first living things among the wonderful
organisms that we call the Monera; they are the simplest organisms
known to us&mdash;in fact, the simplest we can conceive. Their
whole body consists merely of a simple particle or globule of
structureless plasm or plasson. The discoveries of the last four
decades have led us to believe with increasing certainty that
wherever a natural body exhibits the vital processes of nutrition,
reproduction, voluntary movement, and sensation, we have the action
of a nitrogenous carbon-compound of the chemical group of the
albuminoids; this plasm (or protoplasm) is the material basis of
all vital functions. Whether we regarded the function, in the
monistic sense, as the direct action of the material substratum, or
whether we take matter and force to be distinct things in the
dualistic sense, it is certain that we have not as yet found any
living organism in which the exercise of the vital functions is not
inseparably bound up with plasm.</p>

<p>The soft slimy plasson of the body of the moneron is generally
called &ldquo;protoplasm,&rdquo; and identified with the cellular
matter of the ordinary plant and animal cells. But we must, to be
accurate, distinguish between the plasson of the cytodes and the
protoplasm of the cells. This distinction is of the utmost
importance for the purposes of evolution. As I have often said, we
must recognise two different stages of development in these
&ldquo;elementary organisms,&rdquo; or plastids
(&ldquo;builders&rdquo;), that represent the ultimate units of
organic individuality. The earlier and lower stage are the
unnucleated cytodes, the body of which consists of only one kind of
albuminous matter&mdash;the homogeneous plasson or &ldquo;formative
matter.&rdquo; The later and higher stage are the nucleated cells,
in which we find a differentiation of the original plasson into two
different formative substances&mdash;the caryoplasm of the nucleus
and the cytoplasm of the body of the cell (cf. pp. <a href=
"chap6.html">37</a> and <a href="chap6.html#page 42">42</a>).</p>

<p>The Monera are permanent cytodes. Their whole body consists of
soft, structureless plasson. However carefully we examine it with
our finest chemical reagents and most powerful microscopes, we can
find no definite parts or no anatomic structure in it. Hence, the
Monera are literally organisms without organs; in fact, from the
philosophic point of view they are not organisms at all, since they
have no organs. They can only be called organisms in the sense that
they are capable of the vital functions of nutrition, reproduction,
sensation, and movement. If we were to try to imagine the simplest
possible organism, we should frame something like the moneron.</p>

<p>The Monera that we find to-day in various forms fall into two
groups according to the nature of their nutrition&mdash;the <i>
Phytomonera</i> and the <i>Zoomonera</i>; from the physiological
point of view, the former are the simplest specimens of the plant
(<i>phyton</i>) kingdom, and the latter of the animal (<i>zoon</i>)
world. The Phytomonera, especially in their simplest form, the
Chromacea (<i>Phycochromacea</i> or <i>Cyanophycea</i>), are the
most primitive and the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 210">[ 210 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">oldest of living organisms. The typical genus <i>
Chroococcus</i> (Fig. 226) is represented by several fresh-water
species, and often forms a very delicate bluish-green deposit on
stones and wood in ponds and ditches. It consists of round, light
green particles, from 1/7000 to 1/2500 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class="pic">The whole life of these homogeneous globules of
plasm consists of simple growth and reproduction by cleavage. When
the tiny particle has reached a certain size by the continuous
assimilation of inorganic matter, it divides into two equal halves,
by a constriction in the middle. The two daughter-monera that are
thus formed immediately begin a similar vital process. It is the
same with the brown <i>Procytella primordialis</i> (formerly called
the <i>Protococcus marinus</i>); it forms large masses of floating
matter in the arctic seas. The tiny plasma-globules of this species
are of a greenish-brown colour, and have a diameter of 1/10,000 to
1/5000 of an inch. There is no membrane discoverable in the
simplest <i>Chroococcacea,</i> but we find one in other members of
the same family; in <i>Aphanocapsa</i> (Fig. 227) the enveloping
membranes of the social plastids combine; in <i>Gl&oelig;capsa</i>
they are retained through several generations, so that the little
plasma-globules are enfolded in many layers of membrane.</p>

<p>Next to the Chromacea come the Bacteria, which have been evolved
from them by the remarkable change in nutrition which gives us the
simple explanation of the differentiation of plant and animal in
the protist kingdom. The Chromacea build up their plasm directly
from inorganic matter; the Bacteria feed on organic matter. Hence,
if we logically divide the protist kingdom into plasma-forming
Protophyta and plasma-consuming Protozoa, we must class the
Bacteria with the latter; it is quite illogical to describe
them&mdash;as is still often done&mdash;as <i>Schizomycetes,</i>
and class them with the true fungi. The Bacteria, like the
Chromacea, have no nucleus. As is well-known, they play an
important part in modern biology as the causes of fermentation and
putrefaction, and of tuberculosis, typhus, cholera, and other
infectious diseases, and as parasites, etc. But we cannot linger
now to deal with these very interesting features; the Bacteria have
no relation to man&rsquo;s genealogical tree.</p>

<p>We may now turn to consider the remarkable Protam&oelig;ba, or
unnucleated Am&oelig;ba. I have, in the first volume, pointed out
the great importance of the ordinary Am&oelig;ba in connection with
several weighty questions of general biology. The tiny
Protam&oelig;b&aelig;, which are found both in fresh and salt
water, have the same unshapely form and irregular movements of
their simple naked body as the real Am&oelig;b&aelig;; but they
differ from them very materially in having no nucleus in their
cell-body. The short, blunt, finger-like processes that are thrust
out at the surface of the creeping Protam&oelig;ba serve for
getting food as well as for locomotion. They multiply by simple
cleavage (Fig. 228).</p>

<p>The next stage to the simple cytode-forms of the Monera in the
genealogy of mankind (and all other animals) is the simple cell, or
the most rudimentary form of the cell which we find living
independently to-day as the Am&oelig;ba. The earliest process of
inorganic differentiation in the structureless body of the Monera
led to its division into two different substances&mdash;the
caryoplasm and the cytoplasm. The caryoplasm is the inner and
firmer part of the cell, the substance of the nucleus. The
cytoplasm is the outer and softer part, the substance of the body
of the cell. By this important differentiation of the plasson into
nucleus and cell-body, the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 211">[ 211 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">organised cell was evolved from the structureless
cytode, the nucleated from the unnucleated plastid. That the first
cells to appear on the earth were formed from the Monera by such a
differentiation seems to us the only possible view in the present
condition of science. We have a direct instance of this earliest
process of differentiation to-day in the ontogeny of many of the
lower Protists (such as the Gregarin&aelig;).</p>

<p>The unicellular form that we have in the ovum has already been
described as the reproduction of a corresponding unicellular
stem-form, and to this we have ascribed the organisation of an
Am&oelig;ba (cf. Chapter VI). The irregular-shaped Am&oelig;ba,
which we find living independently to-day in our fresh and salt
water, is the least definite and the most primitive of all the
unicellular Protozoa <a href="chap6.html#Fig. 16">(Fig. 16).</a> As
the unripe ova (the <i>protova</i> that we find in the ovaries of
animals) cannot be distinguished from the common Am&oelig;b&aelig;,
we must regard the Am&oelig;ba as the primitive form that is
reproduced in the embryonic stage of the am&oelig;boid ovum to-day,
in accordance with the biogenetic law. I have already pointed out,
in proof of the striking resemblance of the two cells, that the ova
of many of the sponges were formerly regarded as parasitic
Am&oelig;b&aelig; (Figure 1.18). Large unicellular organisms like
the Am&oelig;b&aelig; were found creeping about inside the body of
the sponge, and were thought to be parasites. It was afterwards
discovered that they were really the ova of the sponge from which
the embryos were developed. As a matter of fact, these sponge-ova
are so much like many of the Am&oelig;b&aelig; in size, shape, the
character of their nucleus, and movement of the pseudopodia, that
it is impossible to distinguish them without knowing their
subsequent development.</p>

<p>Our phylogenetic interpretation of the ovum, and the reduction
of it to some ancient am&oelig;boid ancestral form, supply the
answer to the old problem: &ldquo;Which was first, the egg or the
chick?&rdquo; We can now give a very plain answer to this riddle,
with which our opponents have often tried to drive us into a
corner. The egg came a long time before the chick. We do not mean,
of course, that the egg existed from the first as a bird&rsquo;s
egg, but as an indifferent am&oelig;boid cell of the simplest
character. The egg lived for thousands of years as an independent
unicellular organism, the Am&oelig;ba. The egg, in the modern
physiological sense of the word, did not make its appearance until
the descendants of the unicellular Protozoon had developed into
multicellular animals, and these had undergone sexual
differentiation. Even then the egg was first a gastr&aelig;a-egg,
then a platode-egg, then a vermalia-egg, and chordonia-egg; later
still acrania-egg, then fish-egg, amphibia-egg, reptile-egg, and
finally bird&rsquo;s egg. The bird&rsquo;s egg we have experience
of daily is a highly complicated historical product, the result of
countless hereditary processes that have taken place in the course
of millions of years.</p>

<p>The earliest ancestors of our race were simple Protophyta, and
from these our protozoic ancestors were developed afterwards. From
the morphological point of view both the vegetal and the animal
Protists were simple organisms, individualities of the first order,
or plastids. All our later ancestors are complex organisms, or
individualities of a higher order&mdash;social aggregations of a
plurality of cells. The earliest of these, the <i>
Mor&aelig;ada,</i> which represent the third stage in our
genealogy, are very simple associations of homogeneous, indifferent
cells&mdash;undifferentiated colonies of social Am&oelig;b&aelig;
or Infusoria. To understand the nature and origin of these
protozoa-colonies we need only follow step by step the first
embryonic products of the stem-cell. In all the Metazoa the first
embryonic process is the repeated cleavage of the stem-cell, or
first segmentation-cell (Fig. 229). We have already fully
considered this process, and found that all the different forms of
it may be reduced to one type, the original equal or primordial
segmentation (cf. Chapter VIII). In the genealogical tree</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 212">[ 212 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">of the Vertebrates this palingenetic form of
segmentation has been preserved in the Amphioxus alone, all the
other Vertebrates having cenogenetically modified forms of
cleavage. In any case, the latter were developed from the former,
and so the segmentation of the ovum in the Amphioxus has a great
interest for us (cf. Fig. 38). The outcome of this repeated
cleavage is the formation of a round cluster of cells, composed of
homogeneous, indifferent cells of the simplest character (Fig.
230). This is called the <i>morula</i> (= mulberry-embryo) on
account of its resemblance to a mulberry or blackberry.</p>

<p>It is clear that this morula reproduces for us to-day the simple
structure of the multicellular animal that succeeded the
unicellular am&oelig;boid form in the early Laurentian period. In
accordance with the biogenetic law, the morula recalls the
ancestral form of the Mor&aelig;a, or simple colony of Protozoa.
The first cell-communities to be formed, which laid the early
foundation of the higher multicellular body, must have consisted of
homogeneous and simple am&oelig;boid cells. The oldest
Am&oelig;b&aelig; lived isolated lives, and even the am&oelig;boid
cells that were formed by the segmentation of these unicellular
organisms must have continued to live independently for a long
time. But gradually small communities of Am&oelig;b&aelig; arose by
the side of these eremitical Protozoa, the sister-cells produced by
cleavage remaining joined together. The advantages in the struggle
for life which these communities had over the isolated cells
favoured their formation and their further development. We find
plenty of these cell-colonies or communities to-day in both fresh
and salt water. They belong to various groups both of the
Protophyta and Protozoa.</p>

<p>To have some idea of those ancestors of our race that succeeded
phylogenetically to the Mor&aelig;ada, we have only to follow the
further embryonic development of the morula. We then see that the
social cells of the round cluster secrete a sort of jelly or a
watery fluid inside their globular body, and they themselves rise
to the surface of it <a href="chap8.html#Fig. 29">(Fig. 29 <i>F,
G</i>).</a> In this way the solid mulberry-embryo becomes a hollow
sphere, the wall of which is composed of a single layer of cells.
We call this layer the <i>blastoderm,</i> and the sphere itself the
<i>blastula,</i> or embryonic vesicle.</p>

<p>This interesting blastula is very important. The conversion of
the morula into a hollow ball proceeds on the same lines originally
in the most diverse stems&mdash;as, for instance, in many of the
zoophytes and worms, the ascidia, many of the echinoderms and
molluscs, and in the amphioxus. Moreover, in the animals in which
we do not find a real palingenetic blastula the defect is clearly
due to cenogenetic causes, such as the formation of food-yelk and
other embryonic adaptations. We may, therefore, conclude that the
ontogenetic blastula is the reproduction of a very early
phylogenetic ancestral form, and that all the Metazoa are descended
from a common stem-form, which was in the main constructed like the
blastula. In many of the lower animals the blastula is not
developed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 213">[ 213 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">within the f&oelig;tal membranes, but in the open
water. In those cases each blastodermic cell begins at an early
stage to thrust out one or more mobile hair-like processes; the
body swims about by the vibratory movement of these lashes or whips
<a href="chap8.html#Fig. 29">(Fig. 29 <i>F</i>).</a></p>

<p>We still find, both in the sea and in fresh water, various kinds
of primitive multicellular organisms that substantially resemble
the blastula in structure, and may be regarded in a sense as
permanent blastula-forms&mdash;hollow vesicles or gelatinous balls,
with a wall composed of a single layer of ciliated homogeneous
cells. There are &ldquo;blast&aelig;ads&rdquo; of this kind even
among the Protophyta&mdash;the familiar Volvocina, formerly classed
with the infusoria. The common <i>Volvox globator</i> is found in
the ponds in the spring&mdash;a small, green, gelatinous globule,
swimming about by means of the stroke of its lashes, which rise in
pairs from the cells on its surface. In the similar <i>
Halosph&aelig;ra viridis</i> also, which we find in the marine
plancton (floating matter), a number of green cells form a simple
layer at the surface of the gelatinous ball; but in this case there
are no cilia.</p>

<p>Some of the infusoria of the flagellata-class (<i>Signura,
Magosph&aelig;ra,</i> etc.) are similar in structure to these
vegetal clusters, but differ in their animal nutrition; they form
the special group of the <i>Catallacta.</i> In September, 1869, I
studied the development of one of these graceful animals on the
island of Gis-Oe, off the coast of Norway (<i>Magosph&aelig;ra
planula</i>), Figures 2.231 and 2.232). The fully-formed body is a
gelatinous ball, with its wall composed of thirty-two to sixty-four
ciliated cells; it swims about freely in the sea. After reaching
maturity the community is dissolved. Each cell then lives
independently for some time, grows, and changes into a creeping
am&oelig;ba. This afterwards contracts, and clothes itself with a
structureless membrane. The cell then looks just like an ordinary
animal ovum. When it has been in this condition for some time the
cell divides into two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and
sixty-four cells. These arrange themselves in a round vesicle,
thrust out vibratory lashes, burst the capsule, and swim about in
the same magosph&aelig;ra-form with which we started. This
completes the life-circle of the remarkable and instructive
animal.</p>

<p>If we compare these permanent blastul&aelig; with the
free-swimming ciliated larv&aelig; or blastul&aelig;, with similar
construction, of many of the lower animals, we can confidently
deduce from them that there was a very early and long-extinct
common stem-form of substantially the same structure as the
blastula. We may call it the <i>Blast&aelig;a.</i> Its body
consisted, when fully formed, of a simple hollow ball, filled with
fluid or structureless jelly, with a wall composed of a single
stratum of ciliated cells. There were probably many genera and
species of these blast&aelig;ads in the Laurentian period, forming
a special class of marine protists.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that in the plant kingdom also the
simple hollow sphere is found to be an elementary form of the
multicellular organism. At the surface and below the surface (down
to a depth of 2000 yards) of the sea there are green globules
swimming about, with a wall composed of a single layer of
chlorophyll-bearing cells. The botanist Schmitz gave them the name
of <i>Halosph&aelig;ra viridis</i> in 1879.</p>

<p>The next stage to the <i>Blast&aelig;a,</i> and the sixth in our
genealogical tree, is the Gastr&aelig;a that is developed from it.
As we have already seen, this ancestral form is particularly
important. That it once existed is proved with certainty by the
gastrula, which we find temporarily in the ontogenesis of all the
Metazoa (Fig. 29 <i>J, K</i>). As we saw, the original,
palingenetic form of the gastrula is a round or oval uni-axial
body, the simple cavity of which (the primitive gut) has an
aperture at one pole of its axis (the primitive mouth). The wall of
the gut consists of two strata of cells, and these are the primary
germinal layers, the animal skin-layer (ectoderm) and vegetal
gut-layer (entoderm).</p>

<p>The actual ontogenetic development of the gastrula from the
blastula furnishes sound evidence as to the phylogenetic origin of
the <i>Gastr&aelig;a</i> from the <i>Blast&aelig;a.</i> A
pit-shaped depression appears at one side of the spherical blastula
(Fig. 29 <i>H</i>). In the end this invagination goes so far that
the outer or invaginated part of the blastoderm lies close on the
inner or non-invaginated part (Fig. 29 <i>J</i>). In explaining the
phylogenetic origin of the gastr&aelig;a in the light of this
ontogenetic process, we may assume that the one-layered
cell-community of the blast&aelig;a began to take in food more
largely at one particular part of its surface. Natural selection
would gradually lead to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 214">[ 214 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">the formation of a depression or pit at this
alimentary spot on the surface of the ball. The depression would
grow deeper and deeper. In time the vegetal function of taking in
and digesting food would be confined to the cells that lined this
hole; the other cells would see to the animal functions of
locomotion, sensation, and protection. This was the first division
of labour among the originally homogeneous cells of the
blast&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The effect, then, of this earliest histological differentiation
was to produce two different kinds of cells&mdash;nutritive cells
in the depression and locomotive cells on the surface outside. But
this involved the severance of the two primary germinal
layers&mdash;a most important process. When we remember that even
man&rsquo;s body, with all its various parts, and the body of all
the other higher animals, are built up originally out of these two
simple layers, we cannot lay too much stress on the phylogenetic
significance of this gastrulation. In the simple primitive gut or
gastric cavity of the gastrula and its rudimentary mouth we have
the first real organ of the animal frame in the morphological
sense; all the other organs were developed afterwards from these.
In reality, the whole body of the gastrula is merely a
&ldquo;primitive gut.&rdquo; I have shown already (Chapters VIII
and XIX) that the two-layered embryos of all the Metazoa can be
reduced to this typical gastrula. This important fact justifies us
in concluding, in accordance with the biogenetic law, that their
ancestors also were phylogenetically developed from a similar
stem-form. This ancient stem-form is the gastr&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The gastr&aelig;a probably lived in the sea during the
Laurentian period, swimming about in the water by means of its
ciliary coat much as free ciliated gastrul&aelig; do to-day.
Probably it differed from the existing gastrula only in one
essential point, though extinct millions of years ago. We have
reason, from comparative anatomy and ontogeny, to believe that it
multiplied by sexual generation, not merely asexually (by cleavage,
gemmation, and spores), as was no doubt the case with the earlier
ancestors. Some of the cells of the primary germ-layers probably
became ova and others fertilising sperm. We base these hypotheses
on the fact that we do to-day find the simplest form of sexual
reproduction in some of the living gastr&aelig;ads and other lower
animals, especially the sponges.</p>

<p>The fact that there are still in existence various kinds of
gastr&aelig;ads, or lower Metazoa with an organisation little
higher than that of the hypothetical gastr&aelig;a, is a strong
point in favour of our theory. There are not very many species of
these living gastr&aelig;ads; but their morphological and
phylogenetic interest is so great, and their intermediate position
between the Protozoa and Metazoa so instructive, that I proposed
long ago (1876) to make a special class of them. I distinguished
three orders in this class&mdash;the Gastremaria, Physemaria, and
Cyemaria (or Dicyemida).</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 215">[ 215 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">But we might also regard these three orders as so
many independent classes in a primitive gastr&aelig;ad stem.</p>

<p>The Gastremaria and Cyemaria, the chief of these living
gastr&aelig;ads, are small Metazoa that live parasitically inside
other Metazoa, and are, as a rule, 1/50 to 1/25 of an inch long,
often much less (Fig. 233, 1&ndash;15). Their soft body, devoid of
skeleton, consists of two simple strata of cells, the primary
germinal layers; the outer of these is thickly clothed with long
hair-like lashes, by which the parasites swim about in the various
cavities of their host. The inner germinal layer furnishes the
sexual products. The pure type of the original gastrula (or <i>
archigastrula,</i> <a href="chap8.html#Fig. 29">Fig. 29 <i>
I</i>)</a> is seen in the <i>Pemmatodiscus gastrulaceus,</i> which
Monticelli discovered in the umbrella of a large medusa (<i>Pilema
pulmo</i>) in 1895; the convex surface of this gelatinous umbrella
was covered with numbers of clear vesicles, of 1/25 to 1/8 inch in
diameter, in the fluid contents of which the little parasites were
swimming. The cup-shaped body of the <i>Pemmatodiscus</i> (Fig.
233, <i>1</i>) is sometimes rather flat, and shaped like a hat or
cone, at other times almost curved into a semi-circle. The simple
hollow of the cup, the primitive gut (<i>g</i>), has a narrow
opening (<i>o</i>). The skin layer (<i>e</i>) consists of long
slender cylindrical cells, which bear long vibratory hairs; it is
separated by a thin structureless, gelatinous plate (<i>f</i>) from
the visceral or gut layer (<i>i</i>), the prismatic cells of which
are much smaller and have no cilia. Pemmatodiscus propagates
asexually, by simple longitudinal cleavage; on this account it has
recently been regarded as the representative of a special order of
gastr&aelig;ads (<i>Mesogastria</i>).</p>

<p>Probably a near relative of the <i>Pemmatodiscus</i> is the <i>
Kunstleria Gruveli</i> (Fig. 233, <i>2</i>). It lives in the
body-cavity of Vermalia (Sipunculida), and differs from the former
in having no lashes either on the large ectodermic cells (<i>e</i>)
or the small entodermic (<i>i</i>); the germinal layers are
separated by a thick, cup-shaped, gelatinous mass, which has been
called the &ldquo;clear vesicle&rdquo; (<i>f</i>). The primitive
mouth is surrounded by a dark ring that bears very strong and long
vibratory lashes, and effects the swimming movements.</p>

<p><i>Pemmatodiscus</i> and <i>Kunstleria</i> may be included in
the family of the Gastremaria. To these gastr&aelig;ads with open
gut are closely related the Orthonectida (<i>Rhopalura,</i> Fig.
233, <i>3&ndash;5</i>). They live parasitically in the body-cavity
of echinoderms (Ophiura) and vermalia; they are distinguished by
the fact that their primitive gut-cavity is not empty, but filled
with entodermic cells, from which the sexual cells are developed.
These gastr&aelig;ads are of both sexes, the male (Fig. 3) being
smaller and of a somewhat different shape from the oval female
(Fig. 4).</p>

<p>The somewhat similar <i>Dicyemida</i> (Fig. 6) are distinguished
from the preceding by the fact that their primitive gut-cavity is
occupied by a single large entodermic cell instead of a crowded
group of sexual cells. This cell does not yield sexual products,
but afterwards divides into a number of cells (spores), each of
which, without being impregnated, grows into a small embryo. The
Dicyemida live parasitically in the body-cavity, especially the
renal cavities, of the cuttle-fishes. They fall in several genera,
some of which are characterised by the possession of special polar
cells; the body is sometimes roundish, oval, or club-shaped, at
other times long and cylindrical. The genus <i>Conocyema</i> (Figs.
7&ndash;15) differs from the ordinary <i>Dicyema</i> in having four
polar pimples in the form of a cross, which may be incipient
tentacles.</p>

<p>The classification of the Cyemaria is much disputed; sometimes
they are held to be parasitic infusoria (like the <i>Opalina</i>),
sometimes platodes or vermalia, related to the suctorial worms or
rotifers, but having degenerated through parasitism. I adhere to
the phylogenetically important theory that I advanced in 1876, that
we have here real gastr&aelig;ads, primitive survivors of the
common stem-group of all the Metazoa. In the struggle for life they
have found shelter in the body-cavity of other animals.</p>

<p>The small C&oelig;lenteria attached to the floor of the sea that
I have called the Physemaria (<i>Haliphysema</i> and <i>
Gastrophysema</i>) probably form a third order (or class) of the
living gastr&aelig;ads. The genus <i>Haliphysema</i> (Figs. 234,
235) is externally very similar to a large rhizopod (described by
the same name in 1862) of the family of the <i>Rhabdamminida,</i>
which was at first taken for a sponge. In order to avoid confusion
with these, I afterwards gave them the name of Prophysema. The
whole mature body of the <i>Prophysema</i> is a simple cylindrical
or oval tube, with a two-layered wall. The hollow of the tube is
the gastric cavity, and the upper opening of it the mouth (Fig. 235
<i>m</i>).</p>

<p class="pic">The simplest sponges (<i>Olynthus,</i> Fig. 238)
have the same organisation as the Physemaria. The only material
difference between them is that in the sponge the thin two-layered
body-wall is pierced by numbers of pores. When these are closed
they resemble the Physemaria. Possibly the gastr&aelig;ads that we
call Physemaria are only olynthi with the pores closed. The <i>
Ammoconida,</i> or the simple tubular sand-sponges of the deep-sea
(<i>Ammolynthus,</i> etc.), do not differ from the gastr&aelig;ads
in any important point when the pores are closed. In my <i>
Monograph on the Sponges</i> (with sixty plates) I endeavoured to
prove analytically that all the species of this class can be traced
phylogenetically to a common stem-form (<i>Calcolynthus</i>).</p>

<p>The lowest form of the Cnidaria is also not far removed from the
gastr&aelig;ads. In the interesting common fresh-water polyp
(<i>Hydra</i>) the whole body is simply an oval tube with a double
wall; only in this case the mouth has a crown of tentacles. Before
these develop the hydra resembles an ascula (Figs. 236, 237).

sexual cells of both kinds&mdash;ova and sperm cells&mdash;are

anatomy that hermaphrodism&mdash;the combination of both kinds of
sexual cells in one individual&mdash;is the earliest form of sexual
differentiation; the separation of the sexes (gonochorism) was a
much later phenomenon. The sexual cells originally proceeded from
the edge of the primitive mouth of the gastr&aelig;ad.</p>
