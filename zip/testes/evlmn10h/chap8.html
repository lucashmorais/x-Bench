<b>THE GASTR&AElig;A THEORY</b></center>

<br>
 

<p class="one">There is a substantial agreement throughout the
animal world in the first changes which follow the impregnation of
the ovum and the formation of the stem-cell; they begin in all
cases with the segmentation of the ovum and the formation of the
germinal layers. The only exception is found in the protozoa, the
very lowest and simplest forms of animal life; these remain
unicellular throughout life. To this group belong the am&oelig;bae,
gregarin&aelig;, rhizopods, infusoria, etc. As their whole organism
consists of a single cell, they can never form germinal layers, or
definite strata of cells. But all the other animals&mdash;all the
tissue-forming animals, or <i>metazoa,</i> as we call them, in
contradistinction to the protozoa&mdash;construct real germinal
layers by the repeated cleavage of the impregnated ovum. This we
find in the lower cnidaria and worms, as well as in the more
highly-developed molluscs, echinoderms, articulates, and
vertebrates.</p>

<p>In all these metazoa, or multicellular animals, the chief
embryonic processes are substantially alike, although they often
seem to a superficial observer to differ considerably. The
stem-cell that proceeds from the impregnated ovum always passes by
repeated cleavage into a number of simple cells. These cells are
all direct descendants of the stem-cell, and are, for reasons we
shall see presently, called segmentation-cells. The repeated
cleavage of the stem-cell, which gives rise to these
segmentation-spheres, has long been known as
&ldquo;segmentation.&rdquo; Sooner or later the segmentation-cells
join together to form a round (at first, globular) embryonic sphere
(<i>blastula</i>); they then form into two very different groups,
and arrange themselves</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 60">[ 60 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">in two separate strata&mdash;the two <i>primary
germinal layers.</i> These enclose a digestive cavity, the
primitive gut, with an opening, the primitive mouth. We give the
name of the <i>gastrula</i> to the important embryonic form that
has these primitive organs, and the name of <i>gastrulation</i> to
the formation of it. This ontogenetic process has a very great
significance, and is the real starting-point of the construction of
the multicellular animal body.</p>

<p>The fundamental embryonic processes of the cleavage of the ovum
and the formation of the germinal layers have been very thoroughly
studied in the last thirty years, and their real significance has
been appreciated. They present a striking variety in the different
groups, and it was no light task to prove their essential identity
in the whole animal world. But since I formulated the gastr&aelig;a
theory in 1872, and afterwards (1875) reduced all the various forms
of segmentation and gastrulation to one fundamental type, their
identity may be said to have been established. We have thus
mastered the law of unity which governs the first embryonic
processes in all the animals.</p>

<p>Man is like all the other higher animals, especially the apes,
in regard to these earliest and most important processes. As the
human embryo does not essentially differ, even at a much later
stage of development&mdash;when we already perceive the cerebral
vesicles, the eyes, ears, gill-arches, etc.&mdash;from the similar
forms of the other higher mammals, we may confidently assume that
they agree in the earliest embryonic processes, segmentation and
the formation of germinal layers. This has not yet, it is true,
been established by observation. We have never yet had occasion to
dissect a woman immediately after impregnation and examine the
stem-cell or the segmentation-cells in her oviduct. However, as the
earliest human embryos we have examined, and the later and more
developed forms, agree with those of the rabbit, dog, and other
higher mammals, no reasonable man will doubt but that the
segmentation and formation of layers are the same in both
cases.</p>

<p>But the special form of segmentation and layer formation which
we find in the mammal is by no means the original, simple,
palingenetic form. It has been much modified and cenogenetically
altered by a very complex adaptation to embryonic conditions. We
cannot, therefore, understand it altogether in itself. In order to
do this, we have to make a <i>comparative</i> study of segmentation
and layer-formation in the animal world; and we have especially to
seek the original, <i>palingenetic</i> form from which the modified
<i>cenogenetic</i> (see <a href="chap1.html#page 4">p. 4</a>) form
has gradually been developed.</p>

<p>This original unaltered form of segmentation and layer-formation
is found to-day in only one case in the vertebrate-stem to which
man belongs&mdash;the lowest and oldest member of the stem, the
wonderful lancelet or amphioxus (cf. Chapters XVI and XVII). But we
find a precisely similar palingenetic form of embryonic development
in the case of many of the invertebrate animals, as, for instance,
the remarkable ascidia, the pond-snail (<i>Limn&aelig;us</i>), and
arrow-worm (<i>Sagitta</i>), and many of the echinoderms and
cnidaria, such as the common star-fish and sea-urchin, many of the
medus&aelig; and corals, and the simpler sponges (<i>Olynthus</i>).
We may take as an illustration the palingenetic segmentation and
germinal layer-formation in an eight-fold insular coral, which I
discovered in the Red Sea, and described as <i>Monoxenia
Darwinii.</i></p>

<p>The impregnated ovum of this coral (<a href="#Fig. 29">Fig. 29
A, B</a>) first splits into two equal cells (C). First, the nucleus
of the stem-cell and its central body divide into two halves. These
recede from and repel each other, and act as centres of attraction
on the surrounding protoplasm; in consequence of this, the
protoplasm is constricted by a circular furrow, and, in turn,
divides into two halves. Each of the two segmentation-cells thus
produced splits in the same way into two equal cells. The four
segmentation-cells (grand-daughters of the stem-cell) lie in one
plane. Now, however, each of them subdivides into two equal halves,
the cleavage of the nucleus again preceding that of the surrounding
protoplasm. The eight cells which thus arise break into sixteen,
these into thirty-two, and then (each being constantly halved) into
sixty-four, 128, and so on.<sup>1</sup> The final result of
this</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The number of segmentation-cells thus produced
increases geometrically in the original gastrulation, or the purest
palingenetic form of cleavage. However, in different animals the
number reaches a different height, so that the morula, and also the
blastula, may consist sometimes of thirty-two, sometimes of
sixty-four, and sometimes of 128, or more, cells.</p>

<br class="one">
<br>
<p class="one">repeated cleavage is the formation of a globular
cluster of similar segmentation-cells, which we call the
mulberry-formation or morula. The cells are thickly pressed
together like the parts of a mulberry or blackberry, and this gives
a lumpy appearance to the surface of the sphere (Fig.
E).<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>When the cleavage is thus ended, the mulberry-like mass changes
into a hollow globular sphere. Watery fluid or jelly gathers inside
the globule; the segmentation-cells are loosened, and all rise to
the surface. There they are flattened by mutual pressure, and
assume the shape of truncated pyramids, and arrange themselves side
by side in one regular layer (Figs. F, G). This layer of cells is
called the germinal membrane (or blastoderm); the homogeneous cells
which compose its simple structure are called blastodermic cells;
and the whole hollow sphere, the walls of which are made of the
preceding, is called the <i>blastula</i> or <i>
blastosphere.</i><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>In the case of our coral, and of many other lower forms of
animal life, the young embryo begins at once to move independently
and swim about in the water. A fine, long, thread-like process, a
sort of whip or lash, grows out of each blastodermic cell, and this
independently executes vibratory movements, slow at first, but
quicker after a time (Fig. F). In this way each blastodermic cell
becomes a ciliated cell. The combined force of all these vibrating
lashes causes the whole blastula to move about in a rotatory
fashion. In many other animals, especially those in which the
embryo develops within enclosed membranes, the ciliated cells are
only formed at a later stage, or even not formed at all. The
blastosphere may grow and expand by the blastodermic cells (at the
surface of the sphere) dividing and increasing, and more fluid is
secreted in the internal cavity. There are still to-day some
organisms that remain throughout life at the structural stage of
the blastula&mdash;hollow vesicles that swim about by a ciliary
movement in the water, the wall of which is composed of a single
layer of cells, such as the volvox, the magosph&aelig;ra, synura,
etc. We shall speak further of the great phylogenetic significance
of this fact in Chapter XIX.</p>

<p>A very important and remarkable process now
follows&mdash;namely, the curving or invagination of the blastula
(Fig. H). The vesicle with a single layer of cells for wall is
converted into a cup with a wall of two layers of cells (cf. Figs.
G, H, I). A certain spot at the surface of the sphere is flattened,
and then bent inward. This depression sinks deeper and deeper,
growing at the cost of the internal cavity. The latter decreases as
the hollow deepens. At last the internal cavity disappears
altogether, the inner side of the blastoderm (that which lines the
depression) coming to lie close on the outer side. At the same
time, the cells of the two sections assume different sizes and
shapes; the inner cells are more round and the outer more oval
(Fig. I). In this way the embryo takes the form of a cup or
jar-shaped body, with a wall made up of two layers of cells, the
inner cavity of which opens to the outside at one end (the spot
where the depression was originally formed). We call this very
important and interesting embryonic form the
&ldquo;cup-embryo&rdquo; or &ldquo;cup-larva&rdquo;
(<i>gastrula,</i> Fig. 29, I longitudinal section, K external
view). I have in my <i>Natural History of Creation</i> given the
name of <i>depula</i> to the remarkable intermediate form which
appears at the passage of the blastula into the gastrula. In this
intermediate stage there are two cavities in the embryo&mdash;the
original cavity (<i>blastoc&oelig;l</i>) which is disappearing, and
the primitive gut-cavity (<i>progaster</i>) which is forming.</p>

<p>I regard the gastrula as the most important and significant
embryonic form in the animal world. In all real animals (that is,
excluding the unicellular protists) the segmentation of the ovum
produces either a pure, primitive, palingenetic gastrula (Fig. 29
I, K) or an equally instructive cenogenetic form, which has been
developed in time from the first, and can be directly reduced to
it. It is certainly a fact of the greatest interest and
instructiveness that animals of the most different
stems&mdash;vertebrates and tunicates, molluscs and articulates,
echinoderms and annelids, cnidaria and sponges&mdash;proceed from
one and the same embryonic form. In illustration I give a few</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The segmentation-cells which make up the morula
after the close of the palingenetic cleavage seem usually to be
quite similar, and to present no differences as to size, form, and
composition. That, however, does not prevent them from
differentiating into animal and vegetative cells, even during the
cleavage.<br>
2. The blastula of the lower animals must not be confused with the
very different blastula of the mammal, which is properly called the
<i>gastrocystis</i> or <i>blastocystis.</i> This <i>cenogenetic</i>
gastrocystis and the <i>palingenetic</i> blastula are sometimes
very wrongly comprised under the common name of blastula or
vesicula blastodermica.</p>

<p>In view of this extraordinary significance of the gastrula, we
must make a very careful study of its original structure. As a
rule, the typical gastrula is very small, being invisible to the
naked eye, or at the most only visible as a fine point under very
favourable conditions, and measuring generally 1/500 to 1/250 of an
inch (less frequently 1/50 inch, or even more) in diameter. In
shape it is usually like a roundish drinking-cup. Sometimes it is
rather oval, at other times more ellipsoid or spindle-shaped; in
some cases it is half round, or even almost round, and in others
lengthened out, or almost cylindrical.</p>

<p>I give the name of primitive gut (<i>progaster</i>) and
primitive mouth (<i>prostoma</i>) to the internal cavity of the
gastrula-body and its opening; because this cavity is the first
rudiment of the digestive cavity of the organism, and the opening
originally served to take food into it. Naturally, the primitive
gut and mouth change very considerably afterwards in the various
classes of animals. In most of the cnidaria and many of the
annelids (worm-like animals) they remain unchanged throughout life.
But in most of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 64">[ 64 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">higher animals, and so in the vertebrates, only the
larger central part of the later alimentary canal develops from the
primitive gut; the later mouth is a fresh development, the
primitive mouth disappearing or changing into the anus. We must
therefore distinguish carefully between the primitive gut and mouth
of the gastrula and the later alimentary canal and mouth of the
fully developed vertebrate.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The two layers of cells which line the gut-cavity and compose
its wall are of extreme importance. These two layers, which are the
sole builders of the whole organism, are no other than the two
primary germinal layers, or the primitive germ-layers. I have
spoken in the introductory section (Chapter III) of their radical
importance. The outer stratum is the skin-layer, or <i>ectoderm</i>
<a href="#Fig. 30">(Figs. 30&ndash;35<i>e</i>);</a> the inner
stratum is the gut-layer, or <i>entoderm</i> (<i>i</i>). The former
is often also called the ectoblast, or epiblast, and the latter the
endoblast, or hypoblast. <i>From these two primary germinal layers
alone is developed the entire organism of all the metazoa or
multicellular animals.</i> The skin-layer forms the external skin,
the gut-layer forms the internal skin or lining of the body.
Between these two germinal layers are afterwards developed the
middle germinal layer (<i>mesoderma</i>) and the body-cavity
(<i>c&oelig;loma</i>) filled with blood or lymph.</p>

<p>The two primary germinal layers were first distinguished by
Pander in 1817 in the incubated chick. Twenty years later (1849)
Huxley pointed out that in many of the lower zoophytes, especially
the medus&aelig;, the whole body consists throughout life of these
two primary germinal layers. Soon afterwards (1853) Allman
introduced the names which have come into general use; he called
the outer layer the <i>ectoderm</i> (&ldquo;outer-skin&rdquo;), and
the inner the <i>entoderm</i> (&ldquo;inner-skin&rdquo;). But in
1867 it was shown, particularly by Kowalevsky, from comparative
observation, that even in invertebrates, also, of the most
different classes&mdash;annelids, molluscs, echinoderms, and
articulates&mdash;the body is developed out of the same two primary
layers. Finally, I discovered them (1872) in the lowest
tissue-forming animals, the sponges, and proved in my gastr&aelig;a
theory that these two layers must be regarded as identical
throughout the animal world, from the sponges and corals to the
insects and vertebrates, including man. This fundamental
&ldquo;homology</p>

<p class="fnote">1. My distinction (1872) between the primitive gut
and mouth and the later permanent stomach (<i>metagaster</i>) and
mouth (<i>metastoma</i>) has been much criticised; but it is as
much justified as the distinction between the primitive kidneys and
the permanent kidneys. Professor E. Ray-Lankester suggested three
years afterwards (1875) the name <i>archenteron</i> for the
primitive gut, and <i>blastoporus</i> for the primitive mouth.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 65">[ 65 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">[identity] of the primary germinal layers and the
primitive gut&rdquo; has been confirmed during the last thirty
years by the careful research of many able observers, and is now
pretty generally admitted for the whole of the metazoa.</p>

<p>As a rule, the cells which compose the two primary germinal
layers show appreciable differences even in the gastrula stage.
Generally (if not always) the cells of the skin-layer or ectoderm
(Figs. 36 <i>c</i> and 37 <i>e</i>) are the smaller, more numerous,
and clearer; while the cells of the gut-layer, or entoderm
(<i>i</i>), are larger, less numerous, and darker. The protoplasm
of the ectodermic (outer) cells is clearer and firmer than the
thicker and softer cell-matter of the entodermic (inner) cells; the
latter are, as a rule, much richer in yelk-granules (albumen and
fatty particles) than the former. Also the cells of the gut-layer
have, as a rule, a stronger affinity for colouring matter, and take
on a tinge in a solution of carmine, aniline, etc., more quickly
and appreciably than the cells of the skin-layer. The nuclei of the
entoderm-cells are usually roundish, while those of the
ectoderm-cells are oval.</p>

<p>When the doubling-process is complete, very striking
histological differences between the cells of the two layers are
found (Fig. 37). The tiny, light ectoderm-cells (<i>e</i>) are
sharply distinguished from the larger and darker entoderm-cells
(<i>i</i>). Frequently this differentiation of the cell-forms sets
in at a very early stage, during the segmentation-process, and is
already very appreciable in the blastula.</p>

<p>We have, up to the present, only considered that form of
segmentation and gastrulation which, for many and weighty reasons,
we may regard as the original, primordial, or palingenetic form. We
might call it &ldquo;equal&rdquo; or homogeneous segmentation,
because the divided cells retain a resemblance to each other at
first (and often until the formation of the blastoderm). We give
the name of the &ldquo;bell-gastrula,&rdquo; or <i>
archigastrula,</i> to the gastrula that succeeds it. In just the
same form as in the coral we considered (<i>Monoxenia,</i> Fig.
29), we find it in the lowest zoophyta (the gastrophysema, Fig.
30), and the simplest sponges (olynthus, Fig. 36); also in many of
the medus&aelig; and hydrapolyps, lower types of worms of various
classes (brachiopod, arrow-worm, Fig. 31), tunicates (ascidia),
many of the echinoderms (Fig. 32), lower articulates (Fig. 33), and
molluscs (Fig. 34), and, finally, in a slightly modified form, in
the lowest vertebrate (the amphioxus, Fig. 35).</p>

<p class="pic">The gastrulation of the amphioxus is especially interesting
because this lowest and oldest of all the vertebrates is of the
highest significance in connection with the evolution of the
vertebrate stem, and therefore with that of man (compare Chapters
XVI and XVII). Just as the comparative anatomist traces the most
elaborate features in the structures of the various classes of
vertebrates to divergent development from this simple primitive
vertebrate, so comparative embryology traces the various secondary
forms of vertebrate gastrulation to the simple, primary formation
of the germinal layers in the amphioxus. Although this formation,
as distinguished from the cenogenetic modifications of the
vertebrate, may on the whole be regarded as palingenetic, it is
nevertheless different in some features from the quite primitive
gastrulation such as we have, for instance, in the <i>Monoxenia</i>
<a href="#Fig. 29">(Fig. 29)</a> and the <i>Sagitta.</i> Hatschek
rightly observes that the segmentation of the ovum in the amphioxus
is not strictly equal, but almost equal, and approaches the
unequal. The difference in size between the two groups of cells
continues to be very noticeable in the further course of the
segmentation; the smaller animal cells of the upper hemisphere
divide more quickly than the larger vegetal cells of the lower
(Fig. 38 <i>A, B</i>). Hence the blastoderm, which forms the
single-layer wall of the globular blastula at the end of the
cleavage-process, does not consist of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 66">[ 66 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">homogeneous cells of equal size, as in the Sagitta
and the Monoxenia; the cells of the upper half of the blastoderm
(the mother-cells of the ectoderm) are more numerous and smaller,
and the cells of the lower half (the mother-cells of the entoderm)
less numerous and larger. Moreover, the segmentation-cavity of the
blastula (Fig. 38 <i>C, h</i>) is not quite globular, but forms a
flattened spheroid with unequal poles of its vertical axis. While
the blastula is being folded into a cup at the vegetal pole of its
axis, the difference in the size of the blastodermic cells
increases (Fig. 38 <i>D, E</i>); it is most conspicuous when the
invagination is complete and the segmentation-cavity has
disappeared (Fig. 38 <i>F</i>). The larger vegetal cells of the
entoderm are richer in granules, and so darker than the smaller and
lighter animal cells of the ectoderm.</p>

<p>But the unequal gastrulation of the amphioxus diverges from the
typical equal cleavage of the <i>Sagitta,</i> the <i>Monoxenia</i>
<a href="#Fig. 29">(Fig. 29),</a> and the <i>Olynthus</i> <a href=
"#Fig. 36">(Fig. 36),</a> in another important particular. The pure
archigastrula of the latter forms is uni-axial, and it is round in
its whole length in transverse section. The vegetal pole of the
vertical axis is just in the centre of the primitive mouth. This is
not the case in the gastrula of the amphioxus. During the folding
of the blastula the ideal axis is already bent on one side, the
growth of the blastoderm (or the increase of its cells) being
brisker on one side than on the other; the side that grows more
quickly, and so is more curved <a href="#Fig. 39">(Fig. 39 <i>
v</i>),</a> will be the anterior or belly-side, the opposite,
flatter side will form the back (<i>d</i>). The primitive mouth,
which at first, in the typical archigastrula, lay at the vegetal
pole of the main axis, is forced away to the dorsal side; and
whereas its two lips lay at first in a plane at right angles to the
chief axis, they are now so far thrust aside that their plane cuts
the axis at a sharp angle. The dorsal lip is therefore the upper
and more forward, the ventral lip the lower and hinder. In the
latter, at the ventral passage of the entoderm into the ectoderm,
there lie side by side a pair of very large cells, one to the right
and one to the left (Fig. 39 <i>p</i>): these are the important
polar cells of the primitive mouth, or &ldquo;the primitive cells
of the mesoderm.&rdquo; In consequence of these considerable
variations arising in the course of the gastrulation, the primitive
uni-axial form of the archigastrula in the amphioxus has already
become tri-axial, and thus the two-sidedness, or bilateral
symmetry, of the vertebrate body has already been determined. This
has been transmitted from the amphioxus to all the other modified
gastrula-forms of the vertebrate stem.</p>

<p>Apart from this bilateral structure, the gastrula of the
amphioxus resembles the typical archigastrula of the lower animals
<a href="#Fig. 30">(Figs. 30&ndash;36)</a> in developing the two
primary germinal layers from a single layer of cells. This is
clearly the oldest and original form of the metazoic embryo.
Although the animals I have mentioned belong to the most diverse
classes, they nevertheless agree with each other, and many more
animal forms, in having retained to the present day, by a
conservative heredity, this palingenetic form of gastrulation which
they have from their</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 67">[ 67 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">earliest common ancestors. But this is not the case
with the great majority of the animals. With these the original
embryonic process has been gradually more or less altered in the
course of millions of years by adaptation to new conditions of
development. Both the segmentation of the ovum and the subsequent
gastrulation have in this way been considerably changed. In fact,
these variations have become so great in the course of time that
the segmentation was not rightly understood in most animals, and
the gastrula was unrecognised. It was not until I had made an
extensive comparative study, lasting a considerable time (in the
years 1866&ndash;75), in animals of the most diverse classes, that
I succeeded in showing the same common typical process in these
apparently very different forms of gastrulation, and tracing them
all to one original form. I regard all those that diverge from the
primary palingenetic gastrulation as secondary, modified, and
cenogenetic. The more or less divergent form of gastrula that is
produced may be called a secondary, modified gastrula, or a <i>
metagastrula.</i> The reader will find a scheme of these different
kinds of segmentation and gastrulation at the close of this
chapter.</p>

<p>By far the most important process that determines the various
cenogenetic forms of gastrulation is the change in the nutrition of
the ovum and the accumulation in it of nutritive yelk. By this we
understand various chemical substances (chiefly granules of albumin
and fat-particles) which serve exclusively as reserve-matter or
food for the embryo. As the metazoic embryo in its earlier stages
of development is not yet able to obtain its food and so build up
the frame, the necessary material has to be stored up in the ovum.
Hence we distinguish in the ova two chief elements&mdash;the active
formative yelk (protoplasm) and the passive food-yelk (deutoplasm,
wrongly spoken of as &ldquo;the yelk&rdquo;). In the little
palingenetic ova, the segmentation of which we have already
considered, the yelk-granules are so small and so regularly
distributed in the protoplasm of the ovum that the even and
repeated cleavage is not affected by them. But in the great
majority of the animal ova the food-yelk is more or less
considerable, and is stored in a certain part of the ovum, so that
even in the unfertilised ovum the &ldquo;granary&rdquo; can clearly
be distinguished from the formative plasm. As a rule, the
formative-yelk (with the germinal vesicle) then usually gathers at
one pole and the food-yelk at the other. The first is the <i>
animal,</i> and the second the <i>vegetal,</i> pole of the vertical
axis of the ovum.</p>

<p class="pic">In these &ldquo;telolecithal&rdquo; ova, or ova with the yelk at
one end (for instance, in the cyclostoma and amphibia), the
gastrulation then usually takes place in such a way that in the
cleavage of the impregnated ovum the animal (usually the upper)
half splits up more quickly than the vegetal (lower). The
contractions of the active protoplasm, which effect this continual
cleavage of the cells, meet a greater resistance in the lower
vegetal half from the passive deutoplasm than in the upper animal
half. Hence we find in the latter more but smaller, and in the
former fewer but larger, cells. The animal cells produce the
external, and the vegetal cells the internal, germinal layer.</p>

<p>Although this unequal segmentation of the cyclostoma, ganoids,
and amphibia seems at first sight to differ from the original equal
segmentation (for instance, in the monoxenia, Fig. 29), they both
have this in common, that the cleavage process throughout affects
the <i>whole</i> cell; hence Remak called it <i>total</i>
segmentation, and the ova in question <i>holoblastic,</i> or
&ldquo;whole-cleaving.&rdquo; It is otherwise with the second chief
group of ova, which he distinguished from these as <i>
meroblastic,</i> or &ldquo;partially-cleaving &rdquo;: to this
class belong the familiar large eggs of birds and reptiles, and of
most fishes. The inert mass of the passive food-yelk is so</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 68">[ 68 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">large in these cases that the protoplasmic
contractions of the active yelk cannot effect any further cleavage.
In consequence, there is only a partial segmentation. While the
protoplasm in the animal section of the ovum continues briskly to
divide, multiplying the nuclei, the deutoplasm in the vegetal
section remains more or less undivided; it is merely consumed as
food by the forming cells. The larger the accumulation of food, the
more restricted is the process of segmentation. It may, however,
continue for some time (even after the gastrulation is more or less
complete) in the sense that the vegetal cell-nuclei distributed in
the deutoplasm slowly increase by cleavage; as each of them is
surrounded by a small quantity of protoplasm, it may afterwards
appropriate a portion of the food-yelk, and thus form a real
&ldquo;yelk-cell&rdquo; (<i>merocyte</i>). When this vegetal
cell-formation continues for a long time, after the two primary
germinal layers have been formed, it takes the name of the
&ldquo;after-segmentation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meroblastic ova are only found in the larger and more highly
developed animals, and only in those whose embryo needs a longer
time and richer nourishment within the f&oelig;tal membranes.
According as the yelk-food accumulates at the centre or at the side
of the ovum, we distinguish two groups of dividing ova, periblastic
and discoblastic. In the periblastic the food-yelk is in the
centre, enclosed inside the ovum (hence they are also called
&ldquo;centrolecithal&rdquo; ova): the formative yelk surrounds the
food-yelk, and so suffers itself a superficial cleavage. This is
found among the articulates (crabs, spiders, insects, etc.). In the
discoblastic ova the food-yelk gathers at one side, at the vegetal
or lower pole of the vertical axis, while the nucleus of the ovum
and the great bulk of the formative yelk lie at the upper or animal
pole (hence these ova are also called &ldquo;telolecithal&rdquo;).
In these cases the cleavage of the ovum begins at the upper pole,
and leads to the formation of a dorsal discoid embryo. This is the
case with all meroblastic vertebrates, most fishes, the reptiles
and birds, and the oviparous mammals (the monotremes).</p>

<p>The gastrulation of the discoblastic ova, which chiefly concerns
us, offers serious difficulties to microscopic investigation and
philosophic consideration. These, however, have been mastered by
the comparative embryological research which has been conducted by
a number of distinguished observers during the last few
decades&mdash;especially the brothers Hertwig, Rabl, Kupffer,
Selenka, R&uuml;ckert, Goette, Rauber, etc. These thorough and
careful studies, aided by the most perfect modern improvements in
technical method (in tinting and dissection), have given a very
welcome support to the views which I put forward in my work, <i>On
the Gastrula and the Segmentation of the Animal Ovum</i> [not
translated], in 1875. As it is very important to understand these
views and their phylogenetic foundation clearly, not only as
regards evolution in general, but particularly in connection with
the genesis of man, I will give here a brief statement of them as
far as they concern the vertebrate-stem:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. All the vertebrates, including man, are phylogenetically (or
genealogically) related&mdash;that is, are members of one single
natural stem.</p>

<p>2. Consequently, the embryonic features in their individual
development must also have a genetic connection.</p>

<p>3. As the gastrulation of the amphioxus shows the original
palingenetic form in its simplest features, that of the other
vertebrates must have been derived from it.</p>

<p>4. The cenogenetic modifications of the latter are more
appreciable the more food-yelk is stored up in the ovum.</p>

<p>5. Although the mass of the food-yelk may be very large in the
ova of the discoblastic vertebrates, nevertheless in every case a
blastula is developed from the morula, as in the holoblastic
ova.</p>

<p>6. Also, in every case, the gastrula develops from the blastula
by curving or invagination.</p>

<p>7. The cavity which is produced in the f&oelig;tus by this
curving is, in each case, the primitive gut (progaster), and its
opening the primitive mouth (prostoma).</p>

<p>8. The food-yelk, whether large or small, is always stored in
the ventral wall of the primitive gut; the cells (called
&ldquo;merocytes&rdquo;) which may be formed in it subsequently (by
&ldquo;after-segmentation&rdquo;) also belong to the inner germinal
layer, like the cells which immediately enclose the primitive
gut-cavity.</p>

<p>9. The primitive mouth, which at first lies below at the lower
pole of the vertical axis, is forced, by the growth of the yelk,
backwards and then upwards,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 69">[ 69 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">towards the dorsal side of the embryo; the vertical
axis of the primitive gut is thus gradually converted into
horizontal.</p>

<p>10. The primitive mouth is closed sooner or later in all the
vertebrates, and does not evolve into the permanent mouth-aperture;
it rather corresponds to the &ldquo;properistoma,&rdquo; or region
of the anus. From this important point the formation of the middle
germinal layer proceeds, between the two primary layers.</p>

<p>The wide comparative studies of the scientists I have named have
further shown that in the case of the discoblastic higher
vertebrates (the three classes of amniotes) the primitive mouth of
the embryonic disc, which was long looked for in vain, is found
always, and is nothing else than the familiar &ldquo;primitive
groove.&rdquo; Of this we shall see more as we proceed. Meantime we
realise that gastrulation may be reduced to one and the same
process in all the vertebrates. Moreover, the various forms it
takes in the invertebrates can always be reduced to one of the four
types of segmentation described above. In relation to the
distinction between total and partial segmentation, the grouping of
the various forms is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lowest metazoa we know&mdash;namely, the lower zoophyta
(sponges, simple polyps, etc.)&mdash;remain throughout life at a
stage of development which differs little from the gastrula; their
whole body consists of two layers of cells. This is a fact of
extreme importance. We see that man, and also other vertebrates,
pass quickly through a stage of development in which they consist
of two layers, just as these lower zoophyta do throughout life. If
we apply our biogenetic law to the matter, we at once reach this
important conclusion. &ldquo;Man and all the other animals which
pass through the two-layer stage, or gastrula-form, in the course
of their embryonic development, must descend from a primitive
simple stem-form, the whole body of which consisted throughout life
(as is the case with the lower zoophyta to-day) merely of two
cell-strata or germinal layers.&rdquo; We will call this primitive
stem-form, with which we shall deal more fully later on, the <i>
gastr&aelig;a</i>&mdash;that is to say, &ldquo;primitive-gut
animal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to this gastr&aelig;a-theory there was originally in
all the multicellular animals <i>one organ</i> with the same
structure and function. This was the primitive gut; and the two
primary germinal layers which form its wall must also be regarded
as identical in all. This important homology or identity of the
primary germinal layers is proved, on the one hand, from the fact
that the gastrula was originally formed in the same way in all
cases&mdash;namely, by the curving of the blastula; and, on the
other hand, by the fact that in every case the same fundamental
organs arise from the germinal layers. The outer or animal layer,
or ectoderm, always forms the chief organs of animal life&mdash;the
skin, nervous system, sense-organs, etc.; the inner or vegetal
layer, or entoderm, gives rise to the chief organs of vegetative
life&mdash;the organs of nourishment, digestion, blood-formation,
etc.</p>

<p>In the lower zoophyta, whose body remains at the two-layer stage
throughout life, the gastr&aelig;ads, the simplest sponges
(<i>Olynthus</i>), and polyps (<i>Hydra</i>), these two groups of
functions, animal and vegetative, are strictly divided between the
two simple primary layers. Throughout life the outer or animal
layer acts simply as a covering for the body, and accomplishes its
movement and sensation. The inner or vegetative layer of cells acts
throughout life as a gut-lining, or nutritive layer of enteric
cells, and often also yields the reproductive cells.</p>

<p>The best known of these &ldquo;gastr&aelig;ads,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;gastrula-like animals,&rdquo; is the common fresh-water
polyp (<i>Hydra</i>). This simplest of all the cnidaria has, it is
true, a crown of tentacles round its mouth. Also its outer germinal
layer has certain special modifications. But these are secondary
additions, and the inner germinal layer is a simple stratum of
cells. On the whole, the hydra has preserved to our day by heredity
the simple structure of our primitive ancestor, the <i>
gastr&aelig;a</i> (cf. <a href="chap19.html">Chapter XIX</a>).</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 70">[ 70 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br class="one">
<br>
<p>In all other animals, particularly the vertebrates, the gastrula
is merely a brief transitional stage. Here the two-layer stage of
the embryonic development is quickly succeeded by a three-layer,
and then a four-layer, stage. With the appearance of the four
superimposed germinal layers we reach again a firm and steady
standing-ground, from which we may follow the further, and much
more difficult and complicated, course of embryonic
development.</p>
