<b>THE OVUM AND THE AM&OElig;BA</b></center>

<br>
 

<p class="one">In order to understand clearly the course of human
embryology, we must select the more important of its wonderful and
manifold processes for fuller explanation, and then proceed from
these to the innumerable features of less importance. The most
important feature in this sense, and the best starting-point for
ontogenetic study, is the fact that man is developed from an ovum,
and that this ovum is a simple cell. The human ovum does not
materially differ in form and composition from that of the other
mammals, whereas there is a distinct difference between the
fertilised ovum of the mammal and that of any other animal.</p>

<p class="pic">This fact is so important that few should be unaware of its
extreme significance; yet it was quite unknown in the first quarter
of the nineteenth century. As we have seen, the human and mammal
ovum was not discovered until 1827, when Carl Ernst von Baer
detected it. Up to that time the larger vesicles, in which the real
and much smaller ovum is contained, had been wrongly regarded as
ova. The important circumstance that this mammal ovum is a simple
cell, like the ovum of other animals, could not, of course, be
recognised until the cell theory was established. This was not
done, by Schleiden for the plant and Schwann for the animal, until
1838. As we have seen, this cell theory is of the greatest service
in explaining the human frame and its embryonic development. Hence
we must say a few words about the actual condition of the theory
and the significance of the views it has suggested.</p>

<p>In order properly to appreciate the cellular theory, the most
important element in our science, it is necessary to understand in
the first place that the cell is a <i>unified organism,</i> a
self-contained living being. When we anatomically dissect the
fully-formed animal or plant into its various organs, and then
examine the finer structure of these organs with the microscope, we
are surprised to find that all these different parts are ultimately
made up of the same structural element or unit. This common unit of
structure is the cell. It does not matter whether we thus dissect a
leaf, flower, or fruit, or a bone, muscle, gland, or bit of skin,
etc.; we find in every case the same ultimate constituent, which
has been called the cell since Schleiden&rsquo;s discovery. There
are many opinions as to its real nature, but the essential point in
our view of the cell is to look upon it as a self-contained or
independent living unit. It is, in the words of Brucke, &ldquo;an
elementary organism.&rdquo; We may define it most precisely as the
ultimate organic unit, and, as the cells are the sole active
principles in every vital function, we may call them the
&ldquo;plastids,&rdquo; or &ldquo;formative elements.&rdquo; This
unity is found in both the anatomic structure and the physiological
function. In the case of the protists, the entire organism usually
consists of a single independent cell throughout life. But in the
tissue-forming animals and plants, which are the great majority,
the organism begins its career as a simple cell, and then grows
into a cell-community, or, more correctly, an organised cell-state.
Our own body is not really the simple unity that it is generally
supposed to be. On the contrary, it is a very elaborate social
system of countless microscopic organisms, a colony or
commonwealth, made up of innumerable independent units, or very
different tissue-cells.</p>

<br class="one">
<br>
<p>In reality, the term &ldquo;cell,&rdquo; which existed long
before the cell theory was formulated, is not happily chosen.
Schleiden, who first brought it into scientific use in the sense of
the cell theory, gave this name to the elementary organisms
because, when you find them in the dissected plant, they generally
have the appearance of chambers, like the cells in a bee-hive, with
firm walls and a fluid or pulpy content. But some cells, especially
young ones, are entirely without the enveloping membrane, or stiff
wall. Hence we now generally describe the cell as a living, viscous
particle of protoplasm, enclosing a firmer nucleus in its
albuminoid body. There may be an enclosing membrane, as there
actually is in the case of most of the plants; but it may be wholly
lacking, as is the case with most of the animals. There is no
membrane at all in the first stage. The young cells are usually
round, but they vary much in shape later on. Illustrations of this
will be found in the cells of the various parts of the body shown
in <a href="#Fig. 3">Figs. 3&ndash;7.</a></p>

<p>Hence the essential point in the modern idea of the cell is that
it is made up of two different active constituents&mdash;an inner
and an outer part. The smaller and inner part is the nucleus (or
<i>caryon</i> or <i>cytoblastus,</i> <a href="#Fig. 1">Fig.
1<i>c</i></a> and <a href="#Fig. 2">Fig. 2<i>k</i></a>). The outer
and larger part, which encloses the other, is the body of the cell
(<i>celleus, cytos,</i> or <i>cytosoma</i>). The soft living
substance of which the two are composed has a peculiar chemical
composition, and belongs to the group of the albuminoid
plasma-substances (&ldquo;formative matter&rdquo;), or protoplasm.
The essential and indispensable element of the nucleus is called
nuclein (or caryoplasm); that of the cell body is called plastin
(or cytoplasm). In the most rudimentary cases both substances seem
to be quite simple and homogeneous, without any visible structure.
But, as a rule, when we examine them under a high power of the
microscope, we find a certain structure in the protoplasm. The
chief and most common form of this is the fibrous or net-like
&ldquo;thready structure&rdquo; (Frommann) and the frothy
&ldquo;honeycomb structure&rdquo; (B&uuml;tschli).</p>

<p class="pic">The shape or outer form of the cell is infinitely varied, in
accordance with its endless power of adapting itself to the most
diverse activities or environments. In its simplest form the cell
is globular (Fig. 2). This normal round form is especially found in
cells of the simplest construction, and those that are developed in
a free fluid without any external pressure. In such cases the
nucleus also is not infrequently round, and located in the centre
of the cell-body (Fig. 2<i>k</i>). In other cases, the cells have
no definite shape; they are constantly changing their form owing to
their automatic movements. This is the case with the
am&oelig;b&aelig; (<a href="images/fig15.gif">Fig. 15</a> and <a
href="#Fig. 16">16</a>) and the am&oelig;boid travelling cells <a
href="#Fig. 11">(Fig. 11),</a> and also with very young ova <a
href="#Fig. 13">(Fig. 13).</a> However, as a rule, the cell assumes
a definite form in the course of its career. In the tissues of the
multicellular organism, in which a number of similar cells are
bound together in virtue of certain laws of heredity, the shape is
determined partly by the form of their connection and partly by
their special functions. Thus, for instance, we find in the mucous
lining of our tongue very thin and delicate flat cells of roundish
shape <a href="#Fig. 3">(Fig. 3).</a> In the outer skin we find
similar, but harder, covering cells, joined together by saw-like
edges <a href="#Fig. 3">(Fig. 4).</a> In the liver and other glands
there are thicker and softer cells, linked together in rows <a
href="#Fig. 3">(Fig. 5).</a></p>

<p>The last-named tissues (Figs. 3&ndash;5) belong to the simplest
and most primitive type, the group of the
&ldquo;covering-tissues,&rdquo; or epithelia. In these
&ldquo;primary tissues&rdquo; (to which the germinal layers belong)
simple cells of the same kind are arranged in layers. The
arrangement and shape are more complicated in the &ldquo;secondary
tissues,&rdquo; which are gradually developed out of the primary,
as in the tissues of the muscles, nerves, bones, etc. In the bones,
for instance, which belong to the group of supporting or connecting
organs,</p>

star-shaped, and are joined together by numbers of net-like
interlacing processes; so, also, in the tissues of the teeth <a

<p>The cells also differ very much in size. The great majority of
them are invisible to the naked eye, and can be seen only through
the microscope (being as a rule between 1/2500 and 1/250 inch in
diameter). There are many of the smaller plastids&mdash;such as the
famous bacteria&mdash;which only come into view with a very high
magnifying power. On the other hand, many cells attain a
considerable size, and run occasionally to several inches in
diameter, as do certain kinds of rhizopods among the unicellular
protists (such as the radiolaria and thalamophora). Among the
tissue-cells of the animal body many of the muscular fibres and
nerve fibres are more than four inches, and sometimes more than a
yard, in length. Among the largest cells are the yelk-filled ova;
as, for instance, the yellow &ldquo;yolk&rdquo; in the hen&rsquo;s
egg, which we shall describe later <a href="#Fig. 15">(Fig.
15).</a></p>

<p>Cells also vary considerably in structure. In this connection we
must first distinguish between the active and passive components of
the cell. It is only the former, or <i>active</i> parts of the
cell, that really live, and effect that marvellous world of
phenomena to which we give the name of &ldquo;organic life.&rdquo;
The first of these is the inner nucleus (<i>caryoplasm</i>), and
the second the body of the cell (<i>cytoplasm</i>). The <i>
passive</i> portions come third; these are subsequently formed from
the others, and I have given them the name of
&ldquo;plasma-products.&rdquo; They are partly external
(cell-membranes and intercellular matter) and partly internal
(cell-sap and cell-contents).</p>

<p>The nucleus (or caryon), which is usually of a simple roundish
form, is quite structureless at first (especially in very young
cells), and composed of homogeneous nuclear matter or caryoplasm <a
href="#Fig. 2">(Fig. 2<i>k</i>).</a> But, as a rule, it forms a
sort of vesicle later on, in which we can distinguish a more solid
<i>nuclear base (caryobasis)</i> and a softer or fluid <i>nuclear
sap (caryolymph).</i> In a mesh of the nuclear network (or it may
be on the inner side of the nuclear envelope) there is, as a rule,
a dark, very opaque, solid body, called the <i>nucleolus.</i> Many
of the nuclei contain several of these nucleoli (as, for instance,
the germinal vesicle of the ova of fishes and amphibia). Recently a
very small, but particularly important, part of the nucleus has
been distinguished as the <i>central body</i> (centrosoma)&mdash;a
tiny particle that is originally found in the nucleus itself, but
is usually outside it, in the cytoplasm; as a rule, fine threads
stream out from it in the cytoplasm. From the position of the
central body with regard to the other parts it seems probable that
it has a high physiological importance as a centre of movement; but
it is lacking in many cells.</p>

<p>The cell-body also consists originally, and in its simplest
form, of a homogeneous viscid plasmic matter. But, as a rule,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 39">[ 39 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">only the smaller part of it is formed of the living
active cell-substance (protoplasm); the greater part consists of
dead, passive plasma-products (metaplasm). It is useful to
distinguish between the inner and outer of these. External
plasma-products (which are thrust out from the protoplasm as solid
&ldquo;structural matter&rdquo;) are the cell-membranes and the
intercellular matter. The <i>internal</i> plasma-products are
either the fluid cell-sap or hard structures. As a rule, in mature
and differentiated cells these various parts are so arranged that
the protoplasm (like the caryoplasm in the round nucleus) forms a
sort of skeleton or framework. The spaces of this network are
filled partly with the fluid cell-sap and partly by hard structural
products.</p>

<p class="pic">The simple round ovum, which we take as the starting-point of
our study (Figs. 1 and 2), has in many cases the vague, indifferent
features of the typical primitive cell. As a contrast to it, and as
an instance of a very highly differentiated plastid, we may
consider for a moment a large nerve-cell, or ganglionic cell, from
the brain. The ovum stands potentially for the entire
organism&mdash;in other words, it has the faculty of building up
out of itself the whole multicellular body. It is the common parent
of all the countless generations of cells which form the different
tissues of the body; it unites all their powers in itself, though
only potentially or in germ. In complete contrast to this, the
neural cell in the brain <a href="#Fig. 9">(Fig. 9)</a> develops
along one rigid line. It cannot, like the ovum, beget endless
generations of cells, of which some will become skin-cells, others
muscle-cells, and others again bone-cells. But, on the other hand,
the nerve-cell has become fitted to discharge the highest functions
of life; it has the powers of sensation, will, and thought. It is a
real soul-cell, or an elementary organ of the psychic activity. It
has, therefore, a most elaborate and delicate structure.</p>

Numbers of extremely fine threads, like the electric wires at a large
telegraphic centre, cross and recross in the delicate protoplasm of

or nerve-fibres (<i>a, b</i>). We can only partly follow their
intricate paths in the fine matter of the body of the cell.</p>

Nevertheless, this elementary organ of psychic activity&mdash;of
which there are thousands in our brain&mdash;is nothing but a
single cell. Our whole mental life is only the joint result of the
combined activity of all these nerve-cells, or soul-cells. In the
centre of each cell there is a large transparent nucleus,
containing a small and dark nuclear body. Here, as elsewhere, it is
the nucleus that determines the individuality of the cell; it
proves that the whole structure, in spite of its intricate
composition, amounts to only a single cell.</p>

<p class="pic">In contrast with this very elaborate and very strictly
differentiated psychic cell <a href="#Fig. 9">(Fig. 9),</a> we have
our ovum (Figs. 1 and 2), which has hardly any structure at all.
But even in the case of the ovum we must infer from its properties
that its protoplasmic body has a very complicated chemical
composition and a fine molecular structure which escapes our
observation. This presumed molecular structure of the plasm is now
generally admitted; but it has never been seen, and, indeed, lies
far beyond the range of microscopic vision. It must not be
confused&mdash;as is often done&mdash;with the structure of the
plasm (the fibrous network, groups of granules, honey-comb, etc.)
which does come within the range of the microscope.</p>

<p>But when we speak of the cells as the elementary organisms, or
structural units, or &ldquo;ultimate individualities,&rdquo; we
must bear in mind a certain restriction of the phrases. I mean,
that the cells are not, as is often supposed, the very lowest stage
of organic individuality. There are yet more elementary organisms
to which I must refer occasionally. These are what we call the
&ldquo;cytodes&rdquo; (<i>cytos</i> = cell), certain living,
independent beings, consisting only of a particle of <i>
plasson</i>&mdash;an albuminoid substance, which is not yet
differentiated into caryoplasm and cytoplasm, but combines the
properties of both. Those remarkable beings called the <i>
monera</i>&mdash;especially the chromacea and bacteria&mdash;are
specimens of these simple cytodes. (Compare Chapter XIX.) To be
quite accurate, then, we must say: the elementary organism, or the
ultimate individual, is found in two different stages. The first
and lower stage is the cytode, which consists merely of a particle
of plasson, or quite simple plasm. The second and higher stage is
the cell, which is already divided or differentiated into nuclear
matter and cellular matter. We comprise both kinds&mdash;the
cytodes and the cells&mdash;under the name of <i>plastids</i>
(&ldquo;formative particles&rdquo;), because they are the real
builders of the organism. However, these cytodes are not found, as
a rule, in the higher animals and plants; here we have only real
cells with a nucleus. Hence, in these tissue-forming organisms
(both plant and animal) the organic unit always consists of two
chemically and anatomically different parts&mdash;the outer
cell-body and the inner nucleus.</p>

<p>In order to convince oneself that this cell is really an
independent organism, we have only to observe the development and
vital phenomena of one of them. We see then that it performs all
the essential functions of life&mdash;both vegetal and
animal&mdash;which we find in the entire organism. Each of these
tiny beings grows and nourishes itself independently. It takes its
food from the surrounding fluid; sometimes, even, the naked cells
take in solid particles at certain points of their surface&mdash;in
other words, &ldquo;eat&rdquo; them&mdash;without needing any
special mouth and stomach for the purpose (cf. Fig. 19).</p>

<p>Further, each cell is able to reproduce itself. This
multiplication, in most cases, takes the form of a simple cleavage,
sometimes direct, sometimes indirect; the simple direct (or
&ldquo;amitotic&rdquo;) division is less common, and is found, for
instance, in the blood cells <a href="#Fig. 10">(Fig. 10).</a> In
these the nucleus first divides into two equal parts by
constriction. The indirect (or &ldquo;mitotic&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The intricate physiological processes which accompany this
&ldquo;mitosis&rdquo; have been very closely studied of late years.
The inquiry has led to the detection of certain laws of evolution
which are of extreme importance in connection with heredity. As a
rule, two very different parts of the nucleus play an important
part in these changes. They are: the <i>chromatin,</i> or coloured
nuclear substance, which has a peculiar property of tingeing itself
deeply with certain colouring matters (carmine, h&aelig;matoxylin,
etc.), and the <i>achromin</i> (or <i>linin,</i> or <i>
achromatin</i>), a colourless nuclear substance that lacks this
property. The latter generally forms in the dividing cell a sort of
spindle, at the poles of which there is a very small particle, also
colourless, called the &ldquo;central body&rdquo;
(<i>centrosoma</i>). This acts as the centre or focus in a
&ldquo;sphere of attraction&rdquo; for the granules of protoplasm
in the surrounding cell-body, and assumes a star-like appearance
(the cell-star, or <i>monaster</i>). The two central bodies,
standing opposed to each other at the poles of the nuclear spindle,
form &ldquo;the double-star&rdquo; (or <i>amphiaster,</i> <a href=
"#Fig. 11">Fig. 11</a>, B C). The chromatin often forms a long,
irregularly-wound thread&mdash;&ldquo;the coil&rdquo;
(<i>spirema,</i> Fig. A). At the commencement of the cleavage it
gathers at the equator of the cell, between the stellar poles, and
forms a crown of U-shaped loops (generally four or eight, or some
other definite number). The loops split lengthwise into two halves
(B), and these back away from each other towards the poles of the
spindle (C). Here each group forms a crown once more, and this,
with the corresponding half of the divided spindle, forms a fresh
nucleus (D). Then the protoplasm of the cell-body begins to
contract in the middle, and gather about the new daughter-nuclei,
and at last the two daughter-cells become independent beings.</p>

<p>Between this common mitosis, or <i>indirect</i>
cell-division&mdash;which is the normal cleavage-process in most
cells of the higher animals and plants&mdash;and the simple <i>
direct</i> division (Fig. 10) we find every grade of segmentation;
in some circumstances even one kind of division may be converted
into another.</p>

<p>The plastid is also endowed with the functions of movement and
sensation. The single cell can move and creep about, when it has
space for free movement and is not prevented by a hard envelope; it
then thrusts out at its surface processes like fingers, and quickly
withdraws them again, and thus changes its shape (<a href=
"#Fig. 12">Fig. 12</a>). Finally, the young cell is sensitive, or
more or less responsive to stimuli; it makes certain movements on
the application of chemical and mechanical irritation. Hence we can
ascribe to the individual cell all the chief functions which we
comprehend under the general heading of
&ldquo;life&rdquo;&mdash;sensation, movement, nutrition, and
reproduction. All these properties of the multicellular and highly
developed animal are also found in the single animal-cell, at least
in its younger stages. There is no longer any doubt about this, and
so we may regard it as a solid and important base of our
physiological conception of the elementary organism.</p>

<p>Without going any further here into these very interesting
phenomena of the life of the cell, we will pass on to consider the
application of the cell theory to the ovum. Here comparative
research yields the important result that <i>every ovum is at first
a simple cell.</i> I say this is very important, because our whole
science of embryology now resolves itself into the problem:

<p>When we examine a little closer the original features of the
ovum, we notice the extremely significant fact that in its first
stage the ovum is just the same simple and indefinite structure in
the case of man and all the animals (<a href="#Fig. 13">Fig.
13</a>). We are unable to detect any material difference between
them, either in outer shape or internal constitution. Later, though
the ova remain unicellular, they differ in size and shape, enclose
various kinds of yelk-particles, have different envelopes, and so
on. But when we examine them at their birth, in the ovary of the
female animal, we find them to be always of the same form in the
first stages of their life. In the beginning each ovum is a very
simple, roundish, naked, mobile cell, without a membrane; it
consists merely of a particle of cytoplasm enclosing a nucleus (<a
href="#Fig. 13">Fig. 13</a>). Special names have been given to
these parts of the ovum; the cell-body is called the <i>yelk</i>
(<i>vitellus</i>), and the cell-nucleus the <i>germinal
vesicle.</i> As a rule, the</p>

<p class="one">nucleus of the ovum is soft, and looks like a small
pimple or vesicle. Inside it, as in many other cells, there is a
nuclear skeleton or frame and a third, hard nuclear body (the <i>
nucleolus</i>). In the ovum this is called the <i>germinal
spot.</i> Finally, we find in many ova (but not in all) a still
further point within the germinal spot, a &ldquo;nucleolin,&rdquo;
which goes by the name of the germinal point. The latter parts
(germinal spot and germinal point) have, apparently, a minor
importance, in comparison with the other two (the yelk and germinal
vesicle). In the yelk we must distinguish the active <i>formative
yelk</i> (or protoplasm = first plasm) from the passive <i>
nutritive yelk</i> (or deutoplasm = second plasm).</p>

<p>In many of the lower animals (such as sponges, polyps, and
medus&aelig;) the naked ova retain their original simple appearance
until impregnation. But in most animals they at once begin to
change; the change consists partly in the formation of connections
with the yelk, which serve to nourish the ovum, and partly of
external membranes for their protection (the ovolemma, or
prochorion). A membrane of this sort is formed in all the mammals
in the course of the embryonic process. The little globule is
surrounded by a thick capsule of glass-like transparency, the <i>
zona pellucida,</i> or <i>ovolemma pellucidum</i> <a href=
"#Fig. 14">(Fig. 14).</a> When we examine it closely under the
microscope, we see very fine radial streaks in it, piercing the <i>
zona,</i> which are really very narrow canals. The human ovum,
whether fertilised or not, cannot be distinguished from that of
most of the other mammals. It is nearly the same everywhere in
form, size, and composition. When it is fully formed, it has a
diameter of (on an average) about 1/120 of an inch. When the mammal
ovum has been carefully isolated, and held against the light on a
glass-plate, it may be seen as a fine point even with the naked
eye. The ova of most of the higher mammals are about the same size.
The diameter of the ovum is almost always between 1/250 to 1/125
inch. It has always the same globular shape; the same
characteristic membrane; the same transparent germinal vesicle with
its dark germinal spot. Even when we use the most powerful
microscope with its highest power, we can detect no material
difference between the ova of man, the ape, the dog, and so on. I
do not mean to say that there are no differences between the ova of
these different mammals. On the contrary, we are bound to assume
that there are such, at least as regards chemical composition. Even
the ova of different men must differ from each other; otherwise we
should not have a different individual from each ovum. It is true
that our crude and imperfect apparatus cannot detect these subtle
individual differences, which are probably in the molecular
structure. However, such a striking resemblance of their ova in
form, so great as to seem to be a complete similarity, is a strong
proof of the common parentage of man and the other mammals. From
the common germ-form we infer a common stem-form. On the other
hand, there are striking peculiarities by which we can easily
distinguish the fertilised ovum of the mammal from the fertilised
ovum of the birds, amphibia, fishes, and other vertebrates (see the
close of Chap. XXIX).</p>

<p>The fertilised bird-ovum <a href="#Fig. 15">(Fig. 15)</a> is
notably different. It is true that in its earliest stage <a href=
"#Fig. 13">(Fig. 13 E)</a> this ovum also is very like that of the
mammal (Fig. 13 F). But afterwards, while still within the oviduct,
it takes up a quantity of nourishment and works this into the
familiar large yellow yelk. When we examine a very young ovum in

cell, just like the young ova of other animals (Fig. 13). But it
then grows to the size we are familiar with in the round yelk of
the egg. The nucleus of the ovum, or the germinal vesicle, is thus
pressed right to the surface of the globular ovum, and is embedded
there in a small quantity of transparent matter, the so-called
white yelk. This forms a round white spot, which is known as the
&ldquo;tread&rdquo; (<i>cicatricula</i>) <a href="#Fig. 15">(Fig.
15 <i>b</i>).</a> From the tread a thin column of the white yelk
penetrates through the yellow yelk to the centre of the globular
cell, where it swells into a small, central globule (wrongly called
the yelk-cavity, or <i>latebra,</i> Fig. 15 <i>d'</i>). The yellow
yelk-matter which surrounds this white yelk has the appearance in
the egg (when boiled hard) of concentric layers (<i>c</i>). The
yellow yelk is also enclosed in a delicate structureless membrane
(the <i>membrana vitellina, a</i>).</p>

Every animal that has only one cell-nucleus, every am&oelig;ba,
every gregarina, every infusorium, is unicellular, and remains
unicellular whatever variety of matter it feeds on. So the ovum
remains a simple cell, however much yellow yelk it afterwards
accumulates within its protoplasm. It is, of course, different,
with the bird&rsquo;s egg when it has been fertilised. The ovum
then consists of as many cells as there are nuclei in the tread.
Hence, in the fertilised egg which we eat daily, the yellow yelk is
already a multicellular body. Its tread is composed of several
cells, and is now commonly called the <i>germinal disc.</i> We
shall return to this <i>discogastrula</i> in Chap. IX.</p>

<p>When the mature bird-ovum has left the ovary and been fertilised
in the oviduct, it covers itself with various membranes which are
secreted from the wall of the oviduct. First, the large clear
albuminous layer is deposited around the yellow yelk; afterwards,
the hard external shell, with a fine inner skin. All these
gradually forming envelopes and processes are of no importance in
the formation of the embryo; they serve merely for the protection
of the original simple ovum. We sometimes find extraordinarily
large eggs with strong envelopes in the case of other animals, such
as fishes of the shark type. Here, also, the ovum is originally of
the same character as it is in the mammal; it is a perfectly simple
and naked cell. But, as in the case of the bird, a considerable
quantity of nutritive yelk is accumulated inside the original yelk
as food for the developing embryo; and various coverings are formed
round the egg. The ovum of many other animals has the same internal
and external features. They have, however, only a physiological,
not a morphological, importance; they have no direct influence on
the formation of the f&oelig;tus. They are partly consumed as food
by the embryo, and partly serve as protective envelopes. Hence we
may leave them out of consideration altogether here, and restrict
ourselves to material points&mdash;<i>to the substantial identity
of the original ovum in man and the rest of the animals</i> <a

and directly apply this fundamental law of evolution to the human
ovum. We reach a very simple, but very important, conclusion. <i>

recapitulation of the stem-history&mdash;and there can be no doubt
about it&mdash;we are bound to conclude, from the fact that all the

originally sprang from a unicellular being. And as the original
ovum in man and all the other animals has the same simple and
indefinite appearance, we may assume with some probability that
this unicellular stem-form was the common ancestor of the whole
animal world, including man. However, this last hypothesis does not
seem to me as inevitable and as absolutely certain as our first
conclusion.</p>

<p class="pic">This inference from the unicellular embryonic form to the
unicellular ancestor is so simple, but so important, that we cannot
sufficiently emphasise it. We must, therefore, turn next to the
question whether there are to-day any unicellular organisms, from
the features of which we may draw some approximate conclusion as to
the unicellular ancestors of the multicellular organisms. The
answer is: Most certainly there are. There are assuredly still
unicellular organisms which are, in their whole nature, really
nothing more than permanent ova. There are independent unicellular
organisms of the simplest character which develop no further, but
reproduce themselves as such, without any further growth. We know
to-day of a great number of these little beings, such as the
gregarin&aelig;, flagellata, acineta, infusoria, etc. However,
there is one of them that has an especial interest for us, because
it at once suggests itself when we raise our question, and it must
be regarded as the unicellular being that approaches nearest to the
real ancestral form. This organism is the <i>Am&oelig;ba.</i></p>

<p class="pic">For a long time now we have comprised under the general name of
am&oelig;b&aelig; a number of microscopic unicellular organisms,
which are very widely distributed, especially in fresh-water, but
also in the ocean; in fact, they have lately been discovered in
damp soil. There are also parasitic am&oelig;b&aelig; which live
inside other animals. When we place one of these am&oelig;b&aelig;
in a drop of water under the microscope and examine it with a high
power, it generally appears as a roundish particle of a very
irregular and varying shape (Figs. 16 and 17). In its soft, slimy,
semi-fluid substance, which consists of protoplasm, we see only the
solid globular particle it contains, the nucleus. This unicellular
body moves about continually, creeping in every direction on the
glass on which we are examining it. The movement is effected by the
shapeless body thrusting out finger-like processes at various parts
of its surface; and these are slowly but continually changing, and
drawing the rest of the body after them. After a time, perhaps, the
action changes. The am&oelig;ba suddenly stands still, withdraws
its projections, and assumes a globular shape. In a little while,
however, the round body begins to expand again, thrusts out arms in
another</p>

processes are called &ldquo;false feet,&rdquo; or pseudopodia,
because they act physiologically as feet, yet are not special
organs in the anatomic sense. They disappear as quickly as they
come, and are nothing more than temporary projections of the
semi-fluid and structureless body.</p>

<p>If you touch one of these creeping am&oelig;b&aelig; with a
needle, or put a drop of acid in the water, the whole body at once
contracts in consequence of this mechanical or physical stimulus.
As a rule, the body then resumes its globular shape. In certain
circumstances&mdash;for instance, if the impurity of the water
lasts some time&mdash;the am&oelig;ba begins to develop a covering.
It exudes a membrane or capsule, which immediately hardens, and
assumes the appearance of a round cell with a protective membrane.
The am&oelig;ba either takes its food directly by imbibition of
matter floating in the water, or by pressing into its protoplasmic
body solid particles with which it comes in contact. The latter
process may be observed at any moment by forcing it to eat. If
finely ground colouring matter, such as carmine or indigo, is put
into the water, you can see the body of the am&oelig;ba pressing
these coloured particles into itself, the substance of the cell
closing round them. The am&oelig;ba can take in food in this way at
any point on its surface, without having any special organs for
intussusception and digestion, or a real mouth or gut.</p>

<p>The am&oelig;ba grows by thus taking in food and dissolving the
particles eaten in its protoplasm. When it reaches a certain size
by this continual feeding, it begins to reproduce. This is done by
the simple process of cleavage (Fig. 17). First, the nucleus
divides into two parts. Then the protoplasm is separated between
the two new nuclei, and the whole cell splits into two
daughter-cells, the protoplasm gathering about each of the nuclei.
The thin bridge of protoplasm which at first connects the
daughter-cells soon breaks. Here we have the simple form of direct
cleavage of the nuclei. Without mitosis, or formation of threads,
the homogeneous nucleus divides into two halves. These move away
from each other, and become centres of attraction for the
enveloping matter, the protoplasm. The same direct cleavage of the
nuclei is also witnessed in the reproduction of many other
protists, while other unicellular organisms show the indirect
division of the cell.</p>

<p>Hence, although the am&oelig;ba is nothing but a simple cell, it
is evidently able to accomplish all the functions of the
multicellular organism. It moves, feels, nourishes itself, and
reproduces. Some kinds of these am&oelig;b&aelig; can be seen with
the naked eye, but most of them are microscopically small. It is
for the following reasons that we regard the am&oelig;b&aelig; as
the unicellular organisms which have</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 49">[ 49 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">special phylogenetic (or evolutionary) relations to
the ovum. In many of the lower animals the ovum retains its
original naked form until fertilisation, develops no membranes, and
is then often indistinguishable from the ordinary am&oelig;ba. Like
the am&oelig;b&aelig;, these naked ova may thrust out processes,
and move about as travelling cells. In the sponges these mobile ova
move about freely in the maternal body like independent
am&oelig;b&aelig; <a href="#Fig. 17">(Fig. 17).</a> They had been
observed by earlier scientists, but described as foreign
bodies&mdash;namely, parasitic am&oelig;b&aelig;, living
parasitically on the body of the sponge. Later, however, it was
discovered that they were not parasites, but the ova of the sponge.
We also find this remarkable phenomenon among other animals, such
as the graceful, bell-shaped zoophytes, which we call polyps and
medus&aelig;. Their ova remain naked cells, which thrust out
am&oelig;boid projections, nourish themselves, and move about. When
they have been fertilised, the multicellular organism is formed
from them by repeated segmentation.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, no audacious hypothesis, but a perfectly sound
conclusion, to regard the am&oelig;ba as the particular unicellular
organism which offers us an approximate illustration of the ancient
common unicellular ancestor of all the metazoa, or multicellular
animals. The simple naked am&oelig;ba has a less definite and more
original character than any other cell. Moreover, there is the fact
that recent research has discovered such am&oelig;ba-like cells
everywhere in the mature body of the multicellular animals. They
are found, for instance, in the human blood, side by side with the
red corpuscles, as colourless blood-cells; and it is the same with
all the vertebrates. They are also found in many of the
invertebrates&mdash;for instance, in the blood of the snail. I
showed, in 1859, that these colourless blood-cells can, like the
independent am&oelig;b&aelig;, take up solid particles, or
&ldquo;eat&rdquo; (whence they are called <i>phagocytes</i> =
&ldquo;eating-cells,&rdquo; <a href="#Fig. 19">Fig. 19</a>).
Lately, it has been discovered that many different cells may, if
they have room enough, execute the same movements, creeping about
and eating. They behave just like am&oelig;b&aelig; <a href=
"#Fig. 12">(Fig. 12).</a> It has also been shown that these
&ldquo;travelling-cells,&rdquo; or <i>planocytes,</i> play an
important part in man&rsquo;s physiology and pathology (as means of
transport for food, infectious matter, bacteria, etc.).</p>

<p>The power of the naked cell to execute these characteristic
am&oelig;ba-like movements comes from the contractility (or
automatic mobility) of its protoplasm. This seems to be a universal
property of young cells. When they are not enclosed by a firm
membrane, or confined in a &ldquo;cellular prison,&rdquo; they can
always accomplish these am&oelig;boid movements. This is true of
the naked ova as well as of any other naked cells, of the
&ldquo;travelling-cells,&rdquo; of various kinds in connective
tissue, lymph-cells, mucus-cells, etc.</p>

<p class="pic">We have now, by our study of the ovum and the comparison of it
with the am&oelig;ba, provided a perfectly sound and most valuable
foundation for both the embryology and the evolution of man. We
have learned that the human ovum is a simple cell, that this ovum
is not materially different from that of other mammals, and that we
may infer from it the existence of a primitive unicellular
ancestral form, with a substantial resemblance to the
am&oelig;ba.</p>

<p>The statement that the earliest progenitors of the human race
were simple cells of this kind, and led an independent unicellular
life like the am&oelig;ba, has not only been ridiculed as the dream
of a natural philosopher, but also been violently censured in
theological journals as &ldquo;shameful and immoral.&rdquo; But, as
I observed in my essay <i>On the Origin and Ancestral Tree of the
Human Race</i> in 1870, this offended piety must equally protest
against the &ldquo;shameful and immoral&rdquo; fact that each human
individual is developed from a simple ovum, and that this human
ovum is indistinguishable from those of the other mammals, and in
its earliest stage is like a naked am&oelig;ba.</p>

<p class="one">We can show this to be a fact any day with the
microscope, and it is little use to close one&rsquo;s eyes to
&ldquo;immoral&rdquo; facts of this kind. It is as indisputable as
the momentous conclusions we draw from it and as the vertebrate
character of man (see <a href="chap11.html">Chap. XI).</a></p>

<a name="Fig. 19">Fig. 19</a>&mdash;<b>Blood-cells that eat, or
phagocytes, from a naked sea-snail</b> (<i>Thetis</i>), greatly
magnified. I was the first to observe in the blood-cells of this
snail the important fact that &ldquo;the blood-cells of the
invertebrates are unprotected pieces of plasm, and take in food, by
means of their peculiar movements, like the
am&oelig;b&aelig;.&rdquo; I had (in Naples, on May 10th, 1859)
injected into the blood-vessels of one of these snails an infusion
of water and ground indigo, and was greatly astonished to find the
blood-cells themselves more or less filled with the particles of
indigo after a few hours. After repeated injections I succeeded in
&ldquo;observing the very entrance of the coloured particles in the
blood-cells, which took place just in the same way as with the
am&oelig;ba.&rdquo; I have given further particulars about this in
my <i>Monograph on the Radiolaria.</i></td>

<p>We now see very clearly how extremely important the cell theory
has been for our whole conception of organic nature.
&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s place in nature&rdquo; is settled beyond
question by it. Apart from the cell theory, man is an insoluble
enigma to us. Hence philosophers, and especially physiologists,
should be thoroughly conversant with it. The soul of man can only
be really understood in the light of the cell-soul, and we have the
simplest form of this in the am&oelig;ba. Only those who are
acquainted with the simple psychic functions of the unicellular
organisms and their gradual evolution in the series of lower
animals can understand how the elaborate mind of the higher
vertebrates, and especially of man, was gradually evolved from
them. The academic psychologists who lack this zoological equipment
are unable to do so.</p>

<p>This naturalistic and realistic conception is a stumbling-block
to our modern idealistic metaphysicians and their theological
colleagues. Fenced about with their transcendental and dualistic
prejudices, they attack not only the monistic system we establish
on our scientific knowledge, but even the plainest facts which go
to form its foundation. An instructive instance of this was seen a
few years ago, in the academic discourse delivered by a
distinguished theologian, Willibald Beyschlag, at Halle, January
12th, 1900, on the occasion of the centenary festival. The
theologian protested violently against the &ldquo;materialistic
dustmen of the scientific world who offer our people the diploma of
a descent from the ape, and would prove to them that the genius of
a Shakespeare or a Goethe is merely a distillation from a drop of
primitive mucus.&rdquo; Another well-known theologian protested
against &ldquo;the horrible idea that the greatest of men, Luther
and Christ, were descended from a mere globule of
protoplasm.&rdquo; Nevertheless, not a single informed and
impartial scientist doubts the fact that these greatest men were,
like all other men&mdash;and all other vertebrates&mdash;developed
from an impregnated ovum, and that this simple nucleated globule of
protoplasm has the same chemical constitution in all the
mammals.</p>
