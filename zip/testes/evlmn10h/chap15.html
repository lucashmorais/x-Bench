<p class="one">Among the many interesting phenomena that we have
encountered in the course of human embryology, there is an especial
importance in the fact that the development of the human body
follows from the beginning just the same lines as that of the other
viviparous mammals. As a fact, all the embryonic peculiarities that
distinguish the mammals from other animals are found also in man;
even the ovum with its distinctive membrane (<i>zona pellucida,</i>
<a href="chap6.html#Fig. 14">Fig. 14</a>) shows the same
typical</p>

<p class="one">structure in all mammals (apart from the older
oviparous monotremes). It has long since been deduced from the
structure of the developed man that his natural place in the animal
kingdom is among the mammals. Linn&eacute; (1735) placed him in
this class with the apes, in one and the same order
(<i>primates</i>), in his <i>Systema Natur&aelig;.</i> This
position is fully confirmed by comparative embryology. We see that
man entirely resembles the higher mammals, and most of all the
apes, in embryonic development as well as in anatomic structure.
And if we seek to understand this ontogenetic agreement in the
light of the biogenetic law, we find that it proves clearly and
necessarily the descent of man from a series of other mammals, and
proximately from the primates. The common origin of man and the
other mammals from a single ancient stem-form can no longer be
questioned; nor can the immediate blood-relationship of man and the
ape.</p>

<p>The essential agreement in the whole bodily form and inner
structure is still visible in the embryo of man and the other
mammals at the late stage of development at which the mammal-body
can be recognised as such. But at a somewhat earlier stage, in
which the limbs, gill-arches, sense-organs, etc., are already
outlined, we cannot yet recognise the mammal embryos as such, or
distinguish them from those of birds and reptiles. When we consider
still earlier stages of development, we are unable to discover any
essential difference in bodily structure between the embryos of
these higher vertebrates and those of the lower, the amphibia and
fishes. If, in fine, we go back to the construction of the body out
of the four germinal layers, we are astonished to perceive that
these four layers are the same in all vertebrates, and everywhere
take a similar part in the building-up of the fundamental organs of
the body. If we inquire as to the origin of these four secondary
layers, we learn that they always arise in the same way from the
two primary layers; and the latter have the same significance in
all the metazoa (<i>i.e.,</i> all animals except the unicellulars).
Finally, we see that the cells which make up the primary germinal
layers owe their origin in every case to the repeated cleavage of a
single simple cell, the stem-cell or fertilised ovum.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay too much stress on this remarkable
agreement in the chief embryonic features in man and the other
animals. We shall make use of it later on for our monophyletic
theory of descent&mdash;the hypothesis of a common descent of man
and all the metazoa from the gastr&aelig;a. The first rudiments of
the principal parts of the body, especially the oldest organ, the
alimentary canal, are the same everywhere; they have always the
same extremely simple form. All the peculiarities that distinguish
the various groups of animals from each other only appear gradually
in the course of embryonic development; and the closer the relation
of the various groups, the later they are found. We may formulate
this phenomenon in a definite law, which may in a sense be regarded
as an appendix to our biogenetic law. This is the law of the
ontogenetic connection of related animal forms. It runs: The closer
the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">relation of two fully-developed animals in respect
of their whole bodily structure, and the nearer they are connected
in the classification of the animal kingdom, the longer do their
embryonic forms retain their identity, and the longer is it
impossible (or only possible on the ground of subordinate features)
to distinguish between their embryos. This law applies to all
animals whose embryonic development is, in the main, an hereditary
summary of their ancestral history, or in which the original form
of development has been faithfully preserved by heredity. When, on
the other hand, it has been altered by cenogenesis, or disturbance
of development, we find a limitation of the law, which increases in
proportion to the introduction of new features by adaptation (cf.
Chapter I, pp. 4&ndash;6). Thus the apparent exceptions to the law
can always be traced to cenogenesis.</p>

<p>When we apply to man this law of the ontogenetic connection of
related forms, and run rapidly over the earliest stages of human
development with an eye to it, we notice first of all the
structural identity of the ovum in man and the other mammals at the
very beginning (Figs. 1, 14). The human ovum possesses all the
distinctive features of the ovum of the viviparous mammals,
especially the characteristic formation of its membrane (<i>zona
pellucida</i>), which clearly distinguishes it from the ovum of all
other animals. When the human f&oelig;tus has attained the age of
fourteen days, it forms a round vesicle (or &ldquo;embryonic
vesicle&rdquo;) about a quarter of an inch in diameter. A thicker
part of its border forms a simple sole-shaped embryonic shield
one-twelfth of an inch long <a href="chap13.html#Fig. 133">(Fig.
133).</a> On its dorsal side we find in the middle line the
straight medullary furrow, bordered by the two parallel dorsal or
medullary swellings. Behind, it passes by the neurenteric canal
into the primitive gut or primitive groove. From this the folding
of the two c&oelig;lom-pouches proceeds in the same way as in the
other mammals (cf. Fig. 96, 97). In the middle of the sole-shaped
embryonic shield the first primitive segments immediately begin to
make their appearance. At this age the human embryo cannot be
distinguished from that of other mammals, such as the hare or
dog.</p>

<p>A week later (or after the twenty-first day) the human embryo
has doubled its length; it is now about one-fifth of an inch long,
and, when seen from the side, shows the characteristic bend of the
back, the swelling of the head-end, the first outline of the three
higher sense-organs, and the rudiments of the gill-clefts, which
pierce the sides of the neck (Fig. 179, III). The allantois has
grown out of the gut behind. The embryo is already entirely
enclosed in the amnion, and is only connected in the middle of the
belly by the vitelline duct with the embryonic vesicle, which
changes into the yelk-sac. There are no extremities or limbs at
this stage, no trace of arms or legs. The head-end has been
strongly differentiated from the tail-end; and the first outlines
of the cerebral vesicles in front, and the heart below, under the
fore-arm, are already more or less clearly seen. There is as yet no
real face. Moreover, we seek in vain at this stage a special
character that may distinguish the human embryo from that of other
mammals.</p>

<p>A week later (after the fourth week, on the twenty-eighth to
thirtieth day of development) the human embryo has</p>

<p class="one">reached a length of about one-third of an inch (Fig
179 IV). We can now clearly distinguish the head with its various
parts; inside it the five primitive cerebral vesicles (fore-brain,
middle-brain, intermediate-brain, hind-brain, and after-brain);
under the head the gill-arches, which divide the gill-clefts; at
the sides of the head the rudiments of the eyes, a couple of pits
in the outer skin, with a pair of corresponding simple vesicles
growing out of the lateral wall of the fore-brain (Figs. 180, 181
<i>a</i>). Far behind the eyes, over the last gill-arches, we see a
vesicular rudiment of the auscultory organ. The rudimentary limbs
are now clearly outlined&mdash;four simple buds of the shape of
round plates, a pair of fore (<i>vg</i>) and a pair of hind legs
(<i>hg</i>), the former a little larger than the latter. The large
head bends over the trunk, almost at a right angle. The latter is
still connected in the middle of its ventral side with the
embryonic vesicle; but the embryo has still further severed itself
from it, so that it already hangs out as the yelk-sac. The hind
part of the body is also very much curved, so that the pointed
tail-end is directed towards the head. The head and face-part are
sunk entirely on the still open breast. The bend soon increases so
much that the tail almost touches the forehead (Fig. 179 V.; Fig.
181). We may then distinguish three or four special curves on the
round dorsal surface&mdash;namely, a skull-curve in the region of
the second cerebral vesicle, a neck-curve at the beginning of the
spinal cord, and a tail-curve at the fore-end. This pronounced
curve is only shared by man and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">the higher classes of vertebrates (the amniotes); it
is much slighter, or not found at all, in the lower vertebrates. At
this age (four weeks) man has a considerable tail, twice as long as
his legs. A vertical longitudinal section through the middle plane
of this tail (Fig. 182) shows that the hinder end of the spinal
marrow extends to the point of the tail, as also does the
underlying chorda (<i>ch</i>), the terminal continuation of the
vertebral column. Of the latter, the rudiments of the seven
coccygeal (or lowest) vertebr&aelig; are visible&mdash;thirty-two
indicates the third and thirty-six the seventh of these. Under the
vertebral column we see the hindmost ends of the two large
blood-vessels of the tail, the principal artery (<i>aorta
caudalis</i> or <i>arteria sacralis media, Ao</i>), and the
principal vein (<i>vena caudalis</i> or <i>sacralis media</i>).
Underneath is the opening of the anus (<i>an</i>) and the
urogenital sinus (<i>S.ug</i>). From this anatomic structure of the
human tail it is perfectly clear that it is the rudiment of an
ape-tail, the last hereditary relic of a long hairy tail, which has
been handed down from our tertiary primate ancestors to the present
day.</p>

mobile; sometimes they contain only muscles and fat, sometimes also

(Fig. 183),</a> we find the alimentary canal formed in the
body-cavity, and for the most part cut off from the embryonic
vesicle. There are both mouth and anus apertures. But the
mouth-cavity is not yet separated from the nasal cavity, and the
face not yet shaped. The heart shows all its four sections; it is
very large, and almost fills the whole of the pectoral cavity (Fig.

primitive kidneys (<i>m</i>) are very large; they fill the greater
part of the abdominal cavity, and extend from the liver (<i>f</i>)
to the pelvic gut. Thus at the end of the first month all the chief
organs are already outlined. But there are at this stage no
features by which the human embryo materially differs from that of
the dog, the hare, the ox, or the horse&mdash;in a word, of any
other higher mammal. All these embryos have the same, or at least a

Thus, for instance, in man the head is larger in proportion to the
trunk than in the ox. The tail is rather longer in the dog than in
man. These are all negligible differences. On the other hand, the
whole internal organisation and the form and arrangement of the

more pronounced. We can see important differences at the sixth, and
still more at the eighth week, especially in the formation of the

man, and the tail is shorter.</p>

Other differences between man and the
lower mammals are found in the relative size of the internal
organs. But even at this stage the human embryo differs very little
from that of the nearest related mammals&mdash;the apes, especially
the anthropomorphic apes.</p>


<p>The features by means of which we distinguish between them are
not clear until later on. Even at a much more advanced stage of
development, when we can distinguish the human f&oelig;tus from
that of the ungulates at a glance, it still closely resembles that
of the higher apes. At last we get the distinctive features,

four months of f&oelig;tal life&mdash;from the sixth to the ninth
month of pregnancy. Then we begin to find also the differences
between the various races of men, especially in regard to the
formation of the skull and the face. (Cf. Chapter XXIII.)</p>

The embryo is enclosed in the delicate amnion-sac. The yelk-sac is
reduced to a small pear-shaped umbilical vesicle; its thin pedicle,
the long vitelline duct, is enclosed in the umbilical cord. In the
latter, behind the vitelline duct, is the much shorter pedicle of
the allantois, the inner lamina of which (the gut-gland layer)
forms a large vesicle in most of the mammals, while the outer

<p>The striking resemblance that persists so long between the
embryo of man and of the higher apes disappears much earlier in the
lower apes. It naturally remains longest in the large
anthropomorphic apes (gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon). The
physiognomic similarity of these animals, which we find so great in
their earlier years, lessens with the increase of age. On the other
hand, it remains throughout life in the remarkable long-nosed ape
of Borneo (<i>Nasalis larvatus</i>). Its finely-shaped nose would
be regarded with envy by many a man who has too little of that
organ. If we compare the face of the long-nosed ape with that of
abnormally ape-like human beings (such as the famous Miss Julia
Pastrana, Fig. 185), it will be admitted to represent a higher
stage of development. There are still people among us who look
especially to the face for the &ldquo;image of God in man.&rdquo;
The long-nosed ape would have more claim to this than some of the
stumpy-nosed human individuals one meets.</p>

<p>This progressive divergence of the human from the animal form,
which is based on the law of the ontogenetic connection between
related forms, is found in the structure of the internal organs as
well as in external form. It is also expressed in the construction
of the envelopes and appendages that we find surrounding the
f&oelig;tus externally, and that we will now consider more closely.
Two of these appendages&mdash;the amnion and the
allantois&mdash;are only found in the three higher classes of
vertebrates, while the third, the yelk-sac, is found in most of the
vertebrates. This is a circumstance of great importance, and it
gives us valuable data for constructing man&rsquo;s genealogical
tree.</p>

<p>As regards the external membrane that encloses the ovum in the
mammal womb,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 165">[ 165 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">we find it just the same in man as in the higher
mammals. The ovum is, the reader will remember, first surrounded by
the transparent structureless <i>ovolemma</i> or <i>zona
pellucida</i> (Figs. 1, 14). But very soon, even in the first week
of development, this is replaced by the permanent chorion. This is
formed from the external layer of the amnion, the <i>serolemma,</i>
or &ldquo;serous membrane,&rdquo; the formation of which we shall
consider presently; it surrounds the f&oelig;tus and its appendages
as a broad, completely closed sac; the space between the two,
filled with clear watery fluid, is the <i>seroc&oelig;lom,</i> or
interamniotic cavity (&ldquo;extra-embryonic body-cavity&rdquo;).
But the smooth surface of the sac is quickly covered with numbers
of tiny tufts, which are really hollow outgrowths like the fingers
of a glove (Figs. 186, 191, 198 <i>chz</i>). They ramify and push
into the corresponding depressions that are formed by the tubular
glands of the mucous membrane of the maternal womb. Thus, the ovum
secures its permanent seat (Fig. 186&ndash;194).</p>

<p>In human ova of eight to twelve days this external membrane, the
chorion, is already covered with small tufts or villi, and forms a
ball or spheroid of one-fourth to one-third of an inch in diameter
(Figs. 186&ndash;188). As a large quantity of fluid gathers inside
it, the chorion expands more and more, so that the embryo only
occupies a small part of the space within the vesicle. The villi of
the chorion grow larger and more numerous. They branch out more and
more. At first the villi cover the whole surface, but they
afterwards disappear from the greater part of it; they then develop
with proportionately greater vigour at a spot where the placenta is
formed from the allantois.</p>

<p>When we open the chorion of a human embryo of three weeks, we
find on the ventral side of the f&oelig;tus a large round sac,
filled with fluid. This is the yelk-sac, or &ldquo;umbilical
vesicle,&rdquo; the origin of which we have considered previously.
The larger the embryo becomes the smaller we find the yelk-sac. In
the end we find the remainder of it in the shape of a small
pear-shaped vesicle, fastened to a long thin stalk (or pedicle),
and hanging from the open belly of the f&oelig;tus <a href=
"#Fig. 194">(Fig. 194).</a> This pedicle is the vitelline duct, and
is separated from the body at the closing of the navel.</p>

<p>Behind the yelk-sac a second appendage,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 166">[ 166 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">of much greater importance, is formed at an early
stage at the belly of the mammal embryo. This is the allantois or
&ldquo;primitive urinary sac,&rdquo; an important embryonic organ,
only found in the three higher classes of vertebrates. In all the
amniotes the allantois quickly appears at the hinder end of the
alimentary canal, growing out of the cavity of the pelvic gut <a
href="chap13.html#Fig. 147">(Fig. 147 <i>r, u,</i></a> Fig. 195 <i>
ALC</i>).</p>

<p>The further development of the allantois varies considerably in
the three sub-classes of the mammals. The two lower sub-classes,
monotremes and marsupials, retain the simpler structure of their
ancestors, the reptiles. The wall of the allantois and the
enveloping serolemma remains smooth and without villi, as in the
birds. But in the third sub-class of the mammals the serolemma
forms, by invagination at its outer surface, a number of hollow
tufts or villi, from which it takes the name of the <i>chorion</i>
or <i>mallochorion.</i> The gut-fibre layer of the allantois,
richly supplied with branches of the umbilical vessel, presses into
these tufts of the primary chorion, and forms the &ldquo;secondary
chorion.&rdquo; Its embryonic blood-vessels are closely correlated
to the contiguous maternal blood-vessels of the environing womb,
and thus is formed the important nutritive apparatus of the embryo
which we call the placenta.</p>

<p>The pedicle of the allantois, which connects the embryo with the
placenta and conducts the strong umbilical vessels from the former
to the latter, is covered by the amnion, and, with this amniotic
sheath and the pedicle of the yelk-sac, forms what is called the
<i>umbilical cord</i> (Fig. 196 <i>al</i>). As the large and
blood-filled vascular network of the f&oelig;tal allantois attaches
itself closely to the mucous lining of the maternal womb, and the
partition between the blood-vessels of mother and child becomes
much thinner, we get that remarkable nutritive apparatus of the
f&oelig;tal body which is characteristic of the placentalia (or
choriata). We shall return afterwards to the closer consideration
of this (cf. Chapter XXIII).</p>

<p>In the various orders of mammals the placenta undergoes many
modifications, and these are in part of great evolutionary
importance and useful in classification. There is only one of these
that need be specially mentioned&mdash;the important fact,
established by Selenka in 1890, that the distinctive human
placentation is confined to the anthropoids. In this most advanced
group of the mammals the allantois is very small, soon loses its
cavity, and then, in common with the amnion, undergoes certain
peculiar changes. The umbilical cord develops in this case from
what is called the &ldquo;ventral pedicle.&rdquo; Until very
recently this was regarded as a structure peculiar to man. We now
know from Selenka that the much-discussed ventral pedicle is merely
the pedicle of the allantois, combined with the pedicle of the
amnion and the rudimentary pedicle of the yelk-sac. It has just the
same structure in the orang and gibbon (Fig. 197) and very probably
in the chimpanzee and gorilla, as in man; it is, therefore, not a
<i>disproof,</i> but a striking fresh proof, of the
blood-relationship of man and the anthropoid apes.</p>

<p>We find only in the anthropoid apes&mdash;the gibbon and orang
of Asia and the chimpanzee and gorilla of Africa&mdash;the peculiar
and elaborate formation of the placenta that characterises man
(Fig. 198).</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 167">[ 167 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">In this case there is at an early stage an intimate
blending of the chorion of the embryo and the part of the mucous
lining of the womb to which it attaches. The villi of the chorion
with the blood-vessels they contain grow so completely into the
tissue of the uterus, which is rich in blood, that it becomes
impossible to separate them, and they form together a sort of cake.
This comes away as the &ldquo;afterbirth&rdquo; at parturition; at
the same time, the part of the mucous lining of the womb that has
united inseparably with the chorion is torn away; hence it is
called the <i>decidua</i> (&ldquo;falling-away membrane&rdquo;),
and also the &ldquo;sieve-membrane,&rdquo; because it is perforated
like a sieve. We find a decidua of this kind in most of the higher
placentals; but it is only in man and the anthropoid apes that it
divides into three parts&mdash;the outer, inner, and placental
decidua. The external or true decidua (Fig. 196 <i>du,</i> Fig. 199
<i>g</i>) is the part of the mucous lining of the womb that clothes
the inner surface of the uterine cavity wherever it is not
connected with the placenta. The placental or spongy decidua
(<i>placentalis</i> or <i>serotina,</i> Fig. 196 <i>ds,</i> Fig.
199 <i>d</i>) is really the placenta itself, or the maternal part
of it (<i>placenta uterina</i>)&mdash;namely, that part of the
mucous lining of the womb which unites intimately with the
chorion-villi of the f&oelig;tal placenta. The internal or false
decidua (<i>interna</i> or <i>reflexa,</i> Fig. 196 <i>dr,</i> Fig.
199 <i>f</i>) is that part of the mucous lining of the womb which
encloses the remaining surface of the ovum, the smooth chorion
(<i>chorion l&aelig;ve</i>), in the shape of a special thin
membrane. The origin of these three different deciduous membranes,
in regard to which quite erroneous views (still retained in their
names) formerly prevailed, is now quite clear, The external <i>
decidua vera</i> is the specially modified and subsequently
detachable superficial stratum of the original mucous lining of the
womb. The placental <i>decidua serotina</i> is that part of the
preceding which is completely transformed by the ingrowth of the
chorion-villi, and is used for constructing the placenta. The inner
<i>decidua reflexa</i> is formed by the rise of a circular fold of
the mucous lining (at the border of the <i>decidua vera</i> and <i>
serotina</i>), which grows over the f&oelig;tus (like the anmnion)
to the end.</p>

<p class="one">apes. Until recently it was thought that the human
embryo was distinguished by its peculiar construction of a solid
allantois and a special ventral pedicle, and that the umbilical
cord developed from this in a different way than in the other
mammals. The opponents of the unwelcome &ldquo;ape-theory&rdquo;
laid great stress on this, and thought they had at last discovered
an important indication that separated man from all the other
placentals. But the remarkable discoveries published by the
distinguished zoologist Selenka in 1890 proved that man shares
these peculiarities of placentation with the anthropoid apes,
though they are not found in the other apes. Thus the very feature
which was advanced by our critics as a disproof became a most
important piece of evidence in favour of our pithecoid origin.)</p>

<p>Of the three vesicular appendages of the amniote embryo which we
have now described the amnion has no blood-vessels at any moment of
its existence. But the other two vesicles, the yelk-sac and the
allantois, are equipped with large blood-vessels, and these effect
the nourishment of the embryonic body. We may take the opportunity
to make a few general observations on the first circulation in the
embryo and its central organ, the heart. The first blood-vessels,
the heart, and the first blood itself, are formed from the
gut-fibre layer. Hence it was called by earlier embryologists the
&ldquo;vascular layer.&rdquo; In a sense the term is quite correct.
But it must not be understood as if all the blood-vessels in the
body came from this layer, or as if the whole of this layer were
taken up only with the formation of blood-vessels. Neither of these
suppositions is true. Blood-vessels may be formed independently in
other parts, especially in the various products of the skin-fibre
layer.</p>

<p>The fore-end of the spindle-shaped tube, which soon bends into
an S-shape (Figure 1.202), divides into a right and left branch.
These tubes are bent upwards arch-wise, and represent the first
arches of the aorta. They rise in the wall of the fore-gut, which
they enclose in a sense, and then unite above, in the upper wall of
the fore gut-cavity, to form a large single artery, that runs
backward immediately under the chorda, and is called the aorta
(Fig. 201 <i>Ao</i>). The first pair of aorta-arches rise on the
inner wall of the first pair of gill-arches, and so lie between the
first gill-arch (<i>k</i>) and the fore-gut (<i>d</i>), just as we
find them throughout life in the fishes. The single aorta, which
results from the conjunction of these two first vascular arches,
divides again immediately into two parallel branches, which run
backwards on either side of the chorda. These are the primitive
aortas which we have already mentioned; they are also called the
posterior vertebral arteries. These two arteries now give off at
each side, behind, at right angles, four or five branches, and
these pass from the embryonic body to the germinative area,
they</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 171">[ 171 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="one">are called omphalo-mesenteric or vitelline arteries.
They represent the first beginning of a f&oelig;tal circulation.
Thus, the first blood-vessels pass over the embryonic body and
reach as far as the edge of the germinative area. At first they are
confined to the dark or &ldquo;vascular&rdquo; area. But they
afterwards extend over the whole surface of the embryonic vesicle.
In the end, the whole of the yelk-sac is covered with a vascular
net-work. These vessels have to gather food from the contents of
the yelk-sac and convey it to the embryonic body. This is done by
the veins, which pass first from the germinative area, and
afterwards from the yelk-sac, to the farther end of the heart. They
are called vitelline, or, frequently, omphalo-mesenteric,
veins.</p>

<p>These vessels naturally atrophy with the degeneration of the
umbilical vesicle, and the vitelline circulation is replaced by a
second, that of the allantois. Large blood-vessels are developed in
the wall of the urinary sac or the allantois, as before, from the
gut-fibre layer. These vessels grow larger and larger, and are very
closely connected with the vessels that develop in the body of the
embryo itself. Thus, the secondary, allantoic circulation gradually
takes the place of the original vitelline circulation. When the
allantois has attached itself to the inner wall of the chorion and
been converted into the placenta, its blood-vessels alone effect
the nourishment of the embryo. They are called umbilical vessels,
and are originally double&mdash;a pair of umbilical arteries and a
pair of umbilical veins. The two umbilical veins <a href=
"#Fig. 183">(Fig. 183 <i>u</i>),</a> which convey blood from the
placenta to the heart, open it first into the united vitelline
veins. The latter then disappear, and the right umbilical vein goes
with them, so that henceforth a single large vein, the left
umbilical vein, conducts all the blood from the placenta to the
heart of the embryo. The two arteries of the allantois, or the
umbilical arteries (Figs. 183 <i>n</i>, 184 <i>n</i>), are merely
the ultimate terminations of the primitive aortas, which are
strongly developed afterwards. This umbilical circulation is
retained until the nine months of embryonic life are over, and the
human embryo enters into the world as the independent individual.
The umbilical cord (Fig. 196 <i>al</i>), in which these large
blood-vessels pass from the embryo to the placenta, comes away,
together with the latter, in the after-birth, and with the use of
the lungs begins an entirely new form of circulation, which is
confined to the body of the infant.</p>

<p>There is a great phylogenetic significance in the perfect
agreement which we find between man and the anthropoid apes in
these important features of embryonic circulation, and the special
construction of the placenta and the umbilical cord. We must infer
from it a close blood-relationship of man and the anthropomorphic
apes&mdash;a common descent of them from one and the same extinct
group of lower apes. Huxley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;pithecometra-principle&rdquo; applies to these ontogenetic

<p>This important Huxleian law, the chief consequence of which is
&ldquo;the descent of man from the ape,&rdquo; has lately been
confirmed in an interesting and unexpected way from the side of the
experimental</p>

<p class="one">physiology of the blood. The experiments of Hans
Friedenthal at Berlin have shown that human blood, mixed with the
blood of lower apes, has a poisonous effect on the latter; the
serum of the one destroys the blood-cells of the other. But this
does not happen when human blood is mixed with that of the
anthropoid ape. As we know from many other experiments that the
mixture of two different kinds of blood is only possible without
injury in the case of two closely related animals of the same
family, we have another proof of the close blood-relationship, in
the literal sense of the word, of man and the anthropoid ape.</p>

<p>The existing anthropoid apes are only a small remnant of a large
family of eastern apes (or <i>Catarrhin&aelig;</i>), from which man
was evolved about the end of the Tertiary period. They fall into
two geographical groups&mdash;the Asiatic and the African
anthropoids. In each group we can distinguish two genera. The
oldest of these four genera is the gibbon <i>Hylobates,</i> Fig.
203); there are from eight to twelve species of it in the East
Indies. I made observations of four of them during my voyage in the
East Indies (1901), and had a specimen of the ash-grey gibbon
(<i>Hylobates leuciscus</i>) living for several months in the
garden of my house in Java. I have described the interesting habits
of this ape (regarded by the Malays as the wild descendant of men
who had lost their way) in my <i>Malayischen</i></p>

<p>The second, larger and stronger, genus of Asiatic anthropoid ape
is the orang (<i>Satyrus</i>); he is now found only in the islands
of Borneo and Sumatra. Selenka, who has published a very thorough
<i>Study of the Development and Cranial Structure of the Anthropoid
Apes</i> (1899), distinguishes ten races of the orang, which may,
however, also be regarded as &ldquo;local varieties or
species.&rdquo; They fall into two sub-genera or genera: one group,
<i>Dyssatyrus</i> (orang-bentang, Fig. 205), is distinguished for
the strength of its limbs, and the formation of very peculiar and
salient cheek-pads in the elderly male; these are wanting in the
other group, the ordinary orang-outang (<i>Eusatyrus</i>).</p>

<p>Several species have lately been distinguished in the two genera
of the black African anthropoid apes (chimpanzee and gorilla). In
the genus <i>Anthropithecus</i> (or <i>Anthropopithecus,</i>
formerly <i>Troglodytes</i>), the bald-headed chimpanzee, <i>A.
calvus</i> (Fig. 206), and the gorilla-like <i>A. mafuca</i> differ
very strikingly from the ordinary <i>Anthropithecus niger</i> (Fig.
207), not only in the size and proportion of many parts of the
body, but also in the peculiar shape of the head, especially the
ears and lips, and in the hair and colour. The controversy that
still continues as to whether these different forms of</p>

This fresh species, described by Frank Beddard in 1897 as

in all such disputes of classifiers there is an utter absence of
clear ideas as to what a species really is.</p>

<p>Of the largest and most famous of all the anthropoid apes, the
gorilla, Paschen has lately discovered a giant-form in the interior
of the Cameroons, which seems to differ from the ordinary species
(<i>Gorilla gina</i> Fig. 208), not only by its unusual size and
strength, but also by a special formation of the skull. This giant
gorilla (<i>Gorilla gigas,</i> Fig. 209) is six feet eight inches
long; the span of its great arms is about nine feet; its powerful
chest is twice as broad as that of a strong man.</p>

<p>The whole structure of this huge anthropoid ape is not merely
very similar to that of man, but it is substantially the same.
&ldquo;The same 200 bones, arranged in the same way, form our
internal skeleton; the same 300 muscles effect our movements; the
same hair covers our skin; the same groups of ganglionic cells
compose the ingenious mechanism of our brain; the same
four-chambered heart is the central pump of our circulation.&rdquo;
The really existing differences in the shape and size of the
various parts are explained by differences in their growth, due to
adaptation to different habits of life and unequal use of the
various organs. This of itself proves morphologically the descent
of man from the ape. We will return to the point in Chapter XXIII.
But I wanted to point already to this important solution of
&ldquo;the question of questions,&rdquo; because that agreement</p>

<p class="one">in the formation of the embryonic membranes and in
f&oelig;tal circulation which I have described affords a
particularly weighty proof of it. It is the more instructive as
even cenogenetic structures may in certain circumstances have a
high phylogenetic value. In conjunction with the other facts, it
affords a striking confirmation of our biogenetic law.</p>
