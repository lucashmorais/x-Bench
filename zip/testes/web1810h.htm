<h1>
Job
</h1><p>
 <a name="C1V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:1</font></a> There was a man in the
land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and
one who feared God, and turned away from evil.  <a name="C1V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:2</font></a> There were born to him seven sons
and three daughters.  <a name="C1V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:3</font></a> His
possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five
hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great
household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the
east.  <a name="C1V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:4</font></a> His sons went and
held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and
called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.  <a name="C1V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:5</font></a> It was so, when the days of their
feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose
up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
number of them all. For Job said, &quot;It may be that my sons have
sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.&quot; Job did so continually.
<p> <a name="C1V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:6</font></a> Now it happened on the
day when the God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that
Satan also came among them.  <a name="C1V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:7</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan, &quot;Where
have you come from?&quot;
<p>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, &quot;From going back and forth
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:8</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan,
&quot;Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is none like him in
the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns
away from evil.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:9</font></a> Then Satan answered
Yahweh, and said, &quot;Does Job fear God for nothing?  <a name="C1V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:10</font></a> Haven't you made a hedge around
him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You
have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
land.  <a name="C1V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:11</font></a> But put forth your
hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your
face.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:12</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan,
&quot;Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don't put
forth your hand.&quot;
<p>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.  <a name="C1V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:13</font></a> It fell on a day when his sons
and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
house,  <a name="C1V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:14</font></a> that there came a
messenger to Job, and said, &quot;The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys
feeding beside them,  <a name="C1V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:15</font></a> and
the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the
servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell
you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:16</font></a> While he was still
speaking, there also came another, and said, &quot;The fire of God has
fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and
consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:17</font></a> While he was still
speaking, there came also another, and said, &quot;The Chaldeans made
three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes,
and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have
escaped to tell you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:18</font></a> While he was still
speaking, there came also another, and said, &quot;Your sons and your
daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,
 <a name="C1V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:19</font></a> and behold, there came a
great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house,
and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to
tell you.&quot;
<p> <a name="C1V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:20</font></a> Then Job arose, and
tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and
worshiped.  <a name="C1V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:21</font></a> He said,
&quot;Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return
there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of
Yahweh.&quot;  <a name="C1V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">1:22</font></a> In all
this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
<p> <a name="C2V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:1</font></a> Again it happened on
the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that
Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.  <a name="C2V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:2</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan, &quot;Where
have you come from?&quot;
<p>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, &quot;From going back and forth in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:3</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan,
&quot;Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in
the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns
away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me
against him, to ruin him without cause.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:4</font></a> Satan answered Yahweh,
and said, &quot;Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for
his life.  <a name="C2V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:5</font></a> But put forth
your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you
to your face.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:6</font></a> Yahweh said to Satan,
&quot;Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:7</font></a> So Satan went forth
from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the
sole of his foot to his head.  <a name="C2V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:8</font></a> He took for himself a potsherd to
scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.  <a name="C2V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:9</font></a> Then his wife said to him,
&quot;Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.&quot;
<p> <a name="C2V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:10</font></a> But he said to her,
&quot;You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we
receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?&quot;
<p>In all this Job didn't sin with his lips.  <a name="C2V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:11</font></a> Now when Job's three friends
heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own
place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize
with him and to comfort him.  <a name="C2V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:12</font></a> When they lifted up their eyes
from a distance, and didn't recognize him, they raised their voices, and
wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads
toward the sky.  <a name="C2V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">2:13</font></a> So they
sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none
spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
<p> <a name="C3V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:1</font></a> After this Job opened
his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.  <a name="C3V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:2</font></a> Job answered: 
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C3V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:3</font></a> &quot;Let the day
perish in which I was born,
<dd>the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.'
<dt> <a name="C3V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:4</font></a> Let that day be
darkness.
<dd>Don't let God from above seek for it,
<dd>neither let the light shine on it.
<dt> <a name="C3V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:5</font></a> Let darkness and the
shadow of death claim it for their own.
<dd>Let a cloud dwell on it.
<dd>Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
<dt> <a name="C3V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:6</font></a> As for that night, let
thick darkness seize on it.
<dd>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.
<dd>Let it not come into the number of the months.
<dt> <a name="C3V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:7</font></a> Behold, let that night
be barren.
<dd>Let no joyful voice come therein.
<dt> <a name="C3V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:8</font></a> Let them curse it who
curse the day,
<dd>who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
<dt> <a name="C3V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:9</font></a> Let the stars of its
twilight be dark.
<dd>Let it look for light, but have none,
<dd>neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
<dt> <a name="C3V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:10</font></a> because it didn't
shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
<dd>nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:11</font></a> &quot;Why didn't I
die from the womb?
<dd>Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
<dt> <a name="C3V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:12</font></a> Why did the knees
receive me?
<dd>Or why the breast, that I should suck?
<dt> <a name="C3V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:13</font></a> For now should I have
lain down and been quiet.
<dd>I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
<dt> <a name="C3V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:14</font></a> with kings and
counselors of the earth,
<dd>who built up waste places for themselves;
<dt> <a name="C3V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:15</font></a> or with princes who
had gold,
<dd>who filled their houses with silver:
<dt> <a name="C3V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:16</font></a> or as a hidden
untimely birth I had not been,
<dd>as infants who never saw light.
<dt> <a name="C3V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:17</font></a> There the wicked
cease from troubling.
<dd>There the weary are at rest.
<dt> <a name="C3V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:18</font></a> There the prisoners
are at ease together.
<dd>They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.
<dt> <a name="C3V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:19</font></a> The small and the
great are there.
<dd>The servant is free from his master.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C3V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:20</font></a> &quot;Why is light
given to him who is in misery,
<dd>life to the bitter in soul,
<dt> <a name="C3V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:21</font></a> Who long for death,
but it doesn't come;
<dd>and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
<dt> <a name="C3V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:22</font></a> who rejoice
exceedingly,
<dd>and are glad, when they can find the grave?
<dt> <a name="C3V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:23</font></a> Why is light given to
a man whose way is hid,
<dd>whom God has hedged in?
<dt> <a name="C3V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:24</font></a> For my sighing comes
before I eat.
<dd>My groanings are poured out like water.
<dt> <a name="C3V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:25</font></a> For the thing which I
fear comes on me,
<dd>That which I am afraid of comes to me.
<dt> <a name="C3V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">3:26</font></a> I am not at ease,
neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
<dd>but trouble comes.&quot;
</dl>
<p> <a name="C4V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:1</font></a> Then Eliphaz the
Temanite answered, 
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C4V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:2</font></a> &quot;If someone
ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?
<dd>But who can withhold himself from speaking?
<dt> <a name="C4V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:3</font></a> Behold, you have
instructed many,
<dd>you have strengthened the weak hands.
<dt> <a name="C4V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:4</font></a> Your words have
supported him who was falling,
<dd>You have made firm the feeble knees.
<dt> <a name="C4V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:5</font></a> But now it is come to
you, and you faint.
<dd>It touches you, and you are troubled.
<dt> <a name="C4V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:6</font></a> Isn't your piety your
confidence?
<dd>Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope?
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C4V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:7</font></a> &quot;Remember, now,
whoever perished, being innocent?
<dd>Or where were the upright cut off?
<dt> <a name="C4V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:8</font></a> According to what I
have seen, those who plow iniquity,
<dd>and sow trouble,
<dd>reap the same.
<dt> <a name="C4V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:9</font></a> By the breath of God
they perish.
<dd>By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
<dt> <a name="C4V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:10</font></a> The roaring of the
lion,
<dd>and the voice of the fierce lion,
<dd>the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
<dt> <a name="C4V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:11</font></a> The old lion perishes
for lack of prey.
<dd>The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C4V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:12</font></a> &quot;Now a thing was
secretly brought to me.
<dd>My ear received a whisper of it.
<dt> <a name="C4V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:13</font></a> In thoughts from the
visions of the night,
<dd>when deep sleep falls on men,
<dt> <a name="C4V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:14</font></a> fear came on me, and
trembling,
<dd>which made all my bones shake.
<dt> <a name="C4V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:15</font></a> Then a spirit passed
before my face.
<dd>The hair of my flesh stood up.
<dt> <a name="C4V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:16</font></a> It stood still, but I
couldn't discern its appearance.
<dd>A form was before my eyes.
<dd>Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,
<dt> <a name="C4V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:17</font></a> 'Shall mortal man be
more just than God?
<dd>Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
<dt> <a name="C4V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:18</font></a> Behold, he puts no
trust in his servants.
<dd>He charges his angels with error.
<dt> <a name="C4V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:19</font></a> How much more, those
who dwell in houses of clay,
<dd>whose foundation is in the dust,
<dd>who are crushed before the moth!
<dt> <a name="C4V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:20</font></a> Between morning and
evening they are destroyed.
<dd>They perish forever without any regarding it.
<dt> <a name="C4V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">4:21</font></a> Isn't their tent cord
plucked up within them?
<dd>They die, and that without wisdom.'
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl> <dt><a name="C5V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:1</font></a> &quot;Call now; is
there any who will answer you?
<dd>To which of the holy ones will you turn?
<dt> <a name="C5V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:2</font></a> For resentment kills
the foolish man,
<dd>and jealousy kills the simple.
<dt> <a name="C5V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:3</font></a> I have seen the
foolish taking root,
<dd>but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
<dt> <a name="C5V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:4</font></a> His children are far
from safety.
<dd>They are crushed in the gate.
<dd>Neither is there any to deliver them,
<dt> <a name="C5V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:5</font></a> whose harvest the
hungry eats up,
<dd>and take it even out of the thorns.
<dd>The snare gapes for their substance.
<dt> <a name="C5V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:6</font></a> For affliction doesn't
come forth from the dust,
<dd>neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
<dt> <a name="C5V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:7</font></a> but man is born to
trouble,
<dd>as the sparks fly upward.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:8</font></a> &quot;But as for me, I
would seek God.
<dd>I would commit my cause to God,
<dt> <a name="C5V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:9</font></a> who does great things
that can't be fathomed,
<dd>marvelous things without number;
<dt> <a name="C5V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:10</font></a> who gives rain on the
earth,
<dd>and sends waters on the fields;
<dt> <a name="C5V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:11</font></a> so that he sets up on
high those who are low,
<dd>those who mourn are exalted to safety.
<dt> <a name="C5V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:12</font></a> He frustrates the
devices of the crafty,
<dd>So that their hands can't perform their enterprise.
<dt> <a name="C5V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:13</font></a> He takes the wise in
their own craftiness;
<dd>the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
<dt> <a name="C5V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:14</font></a> They meet with
darkness in the day time,
<dd>and grope at noonday as in the night.
<dt> <a name="C5V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:15</font></a> But he saves from the
sword of their mouth,
<dd>even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
<dt> <a name="C5V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:16</font></a> So the poor has hope,
<dd>and injustice shuts her mouth.
<dt>
<dt> <a name="C5V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:17</font></a> &quot;Behold, happy
is the man whom God corrects.
<dd>Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
<dt> <a name="C5V18"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:18</font></a> For he wounds, and
binds up.
<dd>He injures, and his hands make whole.
<dt> <a name="C5V19"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:19</font></a> He will deliver you
in six troubles;
<dd>yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.
<dt> <a name="C5V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:20</font></a> In famine he will
redeem you from death;
<dd>in war, from the power of the sword.
<dt> <a name="C5V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:21</font></a> You shall be hidden
from the scourge of the tongue,
<dd>neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
<dt> <a name="C5V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:22</font></a> At destruction and
famine you shall laugh,
<dd>neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C5V23"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:23</font></a> For you shall be in
league with the stones of the field.
<dd>The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.
<dt> <a name="C5V24"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:24</font></a> You shall know that
your tent is in peace.
<dd>You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.
<dt> <a name="C5V25"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:25</font></a> You shall know also
that your seed shall be great,
<dd>Your offspring as the grass of the earth.
<dt> <a name="C5V26"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:26</font></a> You shall come to
your grave in a full age,
<dd>like a shock of grain comes in its season.
<dt> <a name="C5V27"><font size=-1 color="blue">5:27</font></a> Look this, we have
searched it, so it is.
<dd>Hear it, and know it for your good.&quot;
</dl>
<p>
<p> <a name="C6V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:1</font></a> Then Job answered, 
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C6V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:2</font></a> &quot;Oh that my
anguish were weighed,
<dd>and all my calamity laid in the balances!
<dt> <a name="C6V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:3</font></a> For now it would be
heavier than the sand of the seas,
<dd>therefore have my words been rash.
<dt> <a name="C6V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:4</font></a> For the arrows of the
Almighty are within me.
<dd>My spirit drinks up their poison.
<dt>The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
<dd> <a name="C6V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:5</font></a> Does the wild donkey
bray when he has grass?
<dt>Or does the ox low over his fodder?
<dd> <a name="C6V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:6</font></a> Can that which has no
flavor be eaten without salt?

<dd> <a name="C6V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">6:7</font></a> My soul refuses to
touch them.

burning torches.
<dd>Sparks of fire leap forth.
<dt> <a name="C41V20"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:20</font></a> Out of his nostrils
a smoke goes,
<dd>as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
<dt> <a name="C41V21"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:21</font></a> His breath kindles
coals.
<dd>A flame goes forth from his mouth.
<dt> <a name="C41V22"><font size=-1 color="blue">41:22</font></a> There is strength in

like sharp potsherds,

<dd>He is king over all the sons of pride.&quot;
</dl>
<p>
<p> <a name="C42V1"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:1</font></a> Then Job answered
Yahweh,
<dl>
<dt> <a name="C42V2"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:2</font></a> &quot;I know that you
can do all things,
<dd>and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.
<dt> <a name="C42V3"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:3</font></a> You asked, 'Who is
this who hides counsel without knowledge?'
<dd>therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,
<dd>things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.
<dt> <a name="C42V4"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:4</font></a> You said, 'Listen,
now, and I will speak;
<dd>I will question you, and you will answer me.'
<dt> <a name="C42V5"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:5</font></a> I had heard of you by
the hearing of the ear,
<dd>but now my eye sees you.
<dt> <a name="C42V6"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:6</font></a> Therefore I abhor
myself,
<dd>and repent in dust and ashes.&quot;
</dl>
<p>
<p> <a name="C42V7"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:7</font></a> It was so, that after
Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
&quot;My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for
you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
 <a name="C42V8"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:8</font></a> Now therefore, take to
yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer
up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you,
for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly.
For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
has.&quot;
<p> <a name="C42V9"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:9</font></a> So Eliphaz the
Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did
what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.
<p> <a name="C42V10"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:10</font></a> Yahweh turned the
captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as
much as he had before.  <a name="C42V11"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:11</font></a> Then came there to him all his
brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his
acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted
him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on
him. Everyone also gave him a <a href="#N5">piece of money,</a> and
everyone a ring of gold.
<p> <a name="C42V12"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:12</font></a> So Yahweh blessed the
latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep,
six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female
donkeys.  <a name="C42V13"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:13</font></a> He had also
seven sons and three daughters.  <a name="C42V14"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:14</font></a> He called the name of the first,
Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,
Keren Happuch.  <a name="C42V15"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:15</font></a> In all
the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their
father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.  <a name="C42V16"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:16</font></a> After this Job lived one hundred
forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, to four generations.
 <a name="C42V17"><font size=-1 color="blue">42:17</font></a> So Job died, being old
and full of days.

<p>This file should be named web1810h.htm or web1810h.zip<br>

VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, web1810ah.htm</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do
not<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes award-winning information about
Project<br>Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text<br>
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created<br>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.</p>

<p>We need your donations more than ever!</p>

<p>As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list<br>
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.<br>

<p>We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally<br>
request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and<br>
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,<br>
just ask.</p>

<p>While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are<br>
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting<br>
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to<br>
donate.</p>

<p>International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about<br>
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made<br>
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are<br>
ways.</p>

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart<br>
