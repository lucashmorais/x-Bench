<p><b>Classification of the two Types of Old Red
Sandstone.</b>&mdash;We have seen that the Carboniferous strata are
surmounted by the Permian and Trias, both originally included in
England under the name &ldquo;New Red Sandstone,&rdquo; from the
prevailing red colour of the strata. Under the coal came other red
sandstones and shales which were distinguished by the title of
&ldquo;Old Red Sandstone.&rdquo; Afterwards the name of
&ldquo;Devonian&rdquo; was given by Sir R. Murchison and Professor
Sedgwick to marine fossiliferous strata which, in the south of
England, occupy a similar position between the overlying coal and
the underlying Silurian formations.</p>

<p>It may be truly said that in the British Isles the rocks of this
age present themselves in their mineral aspect, and even to some
extent in their fossil contents, under two very different forms;
the one as distinct from the other as are often lacustrine or
fluviatile from marine strata. It has indeed been suggested that by
far the greater part of the deposits belonging to what may be
termed the Old Red Sandstone type are of fresh-water origin. The
number of land-plants, the character of the fishes, and the fact
that the only shell yet discovered belongs to the genus <i>
Anodonta,</i> must be allowed to lend no small countenance to this
opinion. In this case the difficulty of classification when the
strata of this type are compared in different regions, even where
they are contiguous, may arise partly from their having been formed
in distinct hydrographical basins, or in the neighbourhood of the
land in shallow parts of the sea into which large bodies of
fresh-water entered, and where no marine mollusca or corals could
flourish. Under such geographical conditions the limited extent of
some kinds of sediment, as well as the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 440">[ 440 ]</a></p>

<p>absence of those marine forms by which we are able to identify
or contrast marine formations, may be explained, while the great
thickness of the rocks, which might seem at first sight to require
a corresponding depth of water, can often be shown to have been due
to the gradual sinking down of the bottom of the estuary or sea
where the sediment was accumulated.</p>

<p>Another active cause of local variation in Scotland was the
frequency of contemporaneous volcanic eruptions; some of the rocks
derived from this source, as between the Grampians and the Tay,
having formed islands in the sea, and having been converted into
shingle and conglomerate, before the upper portions of the red
shales and sandstones were superimposed.</p>

<p>The dearth of calcareous matter over wide areas is
characteristic of the Old Red Sandstone. This is, no doubt, in
great part due to the absence of shells and corals; but why should
these be so generally wanting in all sedimentary rocks the colour
of which is determined by the red oxide of iron? Some geologists
are of opinion that the waters impregnated with this oxide were
prejudicial to living beings, others that strata permeated with
this oxide would not preserve such fossil remains.</p>

<p>In regard to the two types, the Old Red Sandstone and the
Devonian, I shall first treat of them separately, and then allude
to the proofs of their having been to a great extent
contemporaneous. That they constitute a series of rocks
intermediate in date between the lowest Carboniferous and the
uppermost Silurian is not disputed by the ablest geologists; and it
can no longer be contended that the Upper, Middle, and Lower Old
Red Sandstone preceded in date the three divisions to which, by aid
of the marine shells, the Devonian rocks have been referred, while,
on the other hand, we have not yet data for enabling us to affirm
to what extent the subdivisions of the one series may be the
equivalents in time of those of the other.</p>

<p><b>Upper Old Red Sandstone.</b>&mdash;The highest beds of the
series in Scotland, lying immediately below the coal in Fife, are
composed of yellow sandstone well seen at Dura Den, near Coupar, in
Fife, where, although the strata contain no mollusca, fish have
been found abundantly, and have been referred to the genera <i>
Holoptychius, Pamphractus, Glyptopomus,</i> and many others. In the
county of Cork, in Ireland, a similar yellow sandstone occurs
containing fish of genera characteristic of the Scotch Old Red
Sandstone, as for example Coccosteus (a form represented by many
species in the</p>

<p>Old Red Sandstone and by one only in the Carboniferous group),
and <i>Glytolepis</i> and <i>Asterolepis,</i> both exclusively
confined to the &ldquo;Old Red.&rdquo; In the same Irish sandstone
at Kiltorkan has been found an <i>Anodonta</i> or fresh-water
mussel, the only shell hitherto discovered in the Old Red Sandstone
of the British Isles (see Fig. 494).</p>

<p>In the same formation are found the fern (Fig. 496) and the <i>
Lepidodendron</i> (Fig. 495), and other species of plants, some of
which, Professor Heer remarks, agree specifically with species from
the lower carboniferous beds. This induces him to lean to the
opinion long ago advocated by Sir Richard Griffiths, that the
yellow sandstone, in spite of its fish remains, should be classed
as Lower Carboniferous, an opinion which I am not yet prepared to
adopt. Between the Mountain Limestone and the yellow sandstone in
the south-west of Ireland there intervenes a formation no less than
5000 feet thick, called the &ldquo;Carboniferous slate,&rdquo; and
at the base of this, in some places, are local deposits, such as
the Glengariff Grits, which appear to be beds of passage between
the Carboniferous and Old Red Sandstone groups.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable result of the recent examination of the
fossil flora of Bear Island, latitude 74&deg; 30' N., that
Professor Heer has described as occurring in that part of the
Arctic region (nearly twenty-six degrees to the north of the Irish
locality) a flora agreeing in several of its species with that of
the yellow sandstones of Ireland. This Bear Island flora is
believed by Professor Heer to comprise species of plants some of
which ascend even to the higher stages of the European
Carboniferous formation, or as high as the Mountain Limestone and
Millstone Grit. Pal&aelig;ontologists have long maintained that</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 442">[ 442 ]</a></p>

<p>the same species which have a wide range in space are also the
most persistent in time, which may prepare us to find that some
plants having a vast geographical range may also have endured from
the period of the Upper Devonian to that of the Millstone Grit.</p>

<p>Outliers of the Upper &ldquo;Old Red&rdquo; occur unconformably
on older members of the group, and the formation represented at
Whiteness, near Arbroath, <i>a,</i> <a href="images/fig55.jpg">Fig.
55,</a> may probably be one of these outliers, though the want of
organic remains renders this uncertain. It is not improbable that
the beds given in this section as Nos. 1, 2, and 3, may all belong
to the early part of the period of the Upper Old Red, as some
scales of <i>Holoptychius nobilissimus</i> have been found
scattered through these beds, No. 2, in Strathmore. Another nearly
allied <i>Holoptychius</i> occurs in Dura Den, see Fig. 498 of this
fish and also Fig. 497 of one of its scales, as these last are
often the only parts met with; being scattered in Forfarshire
through red-coloured shales and sandstones, as are scales of a
large species of the same genus in a corresponding matrix in
Herefordshire.* The number of fish obtained from the British Upper
Old Red Sandstone amounts to fifteen species referred to eleven
genera.</p>

<p>Sir R. Murchison groups with this upper division of the Old Red
of Scotland certain light-red and yellow sandstones and grits which
occur in the northernmost part of the mainland, and extend also
into the Orkney and Shetland Islands.</p>

<p>They contain Calamites and other plants which agree generically
with Carboniferous forms.</p>

<p><b>Middle Old Red Sandstone.</b>&mdash;In the northern part of
Scotland there occur a great series of bituminous schists and
flagstones, to the fossil fish of which attention was first called
by the late Hugh Miller. They were afterwards described by Agassiz,
and the rocks containing them were examined by Sir R. Murchison and
Professor Sedgwick, in Caithness, Cromarty, Moray, Nairn, Gamrie in
Banff, and the Orkneys and Shetlands, in which great numbers of
fossil fish have been found. These were at first supposed to be the
oldest known vertebrate animals, as in Cromarty the beds in which
they occur seem to form the base of the Old Red system resting
almost immediately on the crystalline or metamorphic rocks. But in
fact these fish-bearing beds, when they are traced from north to
south, or to the central parts of Scotland, thin out, so that their
relative age to the Lower Old Red Sandstone, presently to be
mentioned, was not at first detected, the two formations not
appearing in superposition in the same district. In Caithness,
however, many hundred feet below the fish-zone of the middle
division, remains of <i>Pteraspis</i> were found by Mr. Peach in
1861. This genus has never yet been found in either of the two
higher divisions of the Old Red Sandstone, and confirms Sir R.
Murchison&rsquo;s previous suspicion that the rocks in which it
occurs belong to the Lower &ldquo;Old Red,&rdquo; or agree in age
with the Arbroath paving-stone.*</p>

<p><i>Fossil Fish of the Middle Old Red Sandstone.</i>&mdash;The
Devonian fish were referred by Agassiz to two of his great orders,
namely, the Placoids and Ganoids. Of the first of these, which in
the Recent period comprise the shark, the dog-fish, and the ray, no
entire skeletons are preserved, but fin-spines, called
ichthyodorulites, and teeth occur. On such remains the genera <i>
Onchus, Odontacanthus,</i> and <i>Ctenodus,</i> a supposed
cestraciont, and some others, have been established.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of the Old Red Sandstone fishes belong
to a sub-order of Ganoids instituted by Huxley in 1861, and for
which he has proposed the name of <i>
Crossopterygid&aelig;</i>,&dagger; or the fringe-finned, in
consideration of the peculiar manner in which the fin-rays of the
paired fins are arranged so as to form a fringe round a central
lobe, as in the Polypterus (see <i>a,</i> Fig. 499), a genus of
which there are several species now inhabiting the Nile and other
African rivers. The reader will at once recognise in <i>
Osteolepis</i> (Fig. 500), one of the common fishes of the Old Red
Sandstone, many points of</p>

</center>

<p>analogy with <i>Polypterus.</i> They not only agree in the
structure of the fin, at first pointed out by Huxley, but also in
the position of the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins, and in having
an elongated body and rhomboidal scales. On the other hand, the
tail is more symmetrical in the recent fish, which has also an
apparatus of dorsal finlets of a very abnormal character, both as
to number and structure. As to the dorsals of <i>Osteolepis,</i>
they are regular in structure and position, having nothing
remarkable about them, except that there are two of them, which is
comparatively unusual in living fish.</p>

<center><img src="images4/fig500.jpg" width="373" height="144" alt=
"Fig. 500: Restoration of Osteolepis."></center>

<p>Among the &ldquo;fringe-finned&rdquo; Ganoids we find some with
rhomboidal scales, such as <i>Osteolepis,</i> Fig. 500; others with
cycloidal scales, as <i>Holoptychius,</i> before mentioned (see
Fig. 498). In the genera <i>Dipterus</i> and <i>Diplopterus,</i> as
Hugh Miller pointed out, and in several other of the fringe-finned
genera, as in <i>Gyroptychius</i> and <i>Glyptolepis,</i> the two
dorsals are placed far backward, or directly over the ventral and
anal fins. The <i>Asterolepis</i> was a ganoid fish of gigantic
dimensions. <i>A. Asmusii,</i> Eichwald, a species characteristic
of the Old Red Sandstone of Russia, as well as that of Scotland,
attained the length of between twenty and thirty feet. It was
clothed with strong bony armour, embossed with star-like tubercles,
but it had only a cartilaginous skeleton. The mouth was furnished
with two rows of teeth, the outer ones small and fish-like, the
inner larger and with a reptilian character. The <i>Asterolepis</i>
occurs also in the Devonian rocks of North America.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 445">[ 445 ]</a></p>

<p>If we except the Placoids already alluded to, and a few other
families of doubtful affinities, all the Old Red Sandstone fishes
are Ganoids, an order so named by Agassiz from the shining outer
surface of their scales; but Professor Huxley has also called our
attention to the fact that, while a few of the primary and the
great majority of the secondary Ganoids resemble the living bony
pike, <i>Lepidosteus,</i> or the <i>Amia,</i> genera now found in
North American rivers, and one of them, <i>Lepidosteus,</i>
extending as far south as Guatemala, the Crossopterygii, or
fringe-finned Ichthyolites, of the Old Red are closely related to
the African <i>Polypterus,</i> which is represented by five or six
species now inhabiting the Nile and the rivers of Senegal. These
North American and African Ganoids are quite exceptional in the
living creation; they are entirely confined to the northern
hemisphere, unless some species of <i>Polypterus</i> range to the
south of the line in Africa; and, out of about 9000 living species
of fish known to M. G&uuml;nther, and of which more than 6000 are
now preserved in the British Museum, they probably constitute no
more than nine.</p>

<img src="images4/fig501.jpg" width="222" height="282" alt=
"Fig. 501: Pterichthys. Upper side, showing mouth." align="right"> 

<p>If many circumstances favour the theory of the fresh-water
origin of the Old Red Sandstone, this view of its nature is not a
little confirmed by our finding that it is in Llake Superior and
the other inland Canadian seas of fresh water, and in the
Mississippi and African rivers, that we at present find those fish
which have the nearest affinity to the fossil forms of this ancient
formation.</p>

<p>Among the anomalous forms of Old Red fishes not referable to
Huxley&rsquo;s Crossopterygii is the <i>Pterichthys,</i> of which
five species have been found in the middle division of the Old Red
of Scotland. Some writers have compared their shelly covering to
that of Crustaceans, with which, however, they have no real
affinity. The wing-like appendages, whence the genus is named, were
first supposed by Hugh Miller to be paddles, like those of the
turtle; and there can now be no doubt that they do really
correspond with the pectoral fins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 446">[ 446 ]</a></p>

<p>The number of species of fish already obtained from the middle
division of the Old Red Sandstone in Great Britain is about 70, and
the principal genera, besides <i>Osteolepis</i> and <i>
Pterichthys,</i> already mentioned, are <i>Glyptolepis,
Diplacanthus, Dendrodus, Coccosteus, Cheirancanthus,</i> and <i>
Acanthoides.</i></p>

<p><b>Lower Old Red Sandstone.</b>&mdash;The third or lowest
division south of the Grampians consists of grey paving-stone and
roofing-slate, with associated red and grey shales; these strata
underlie a dense mass of conglomerate. In these grey beds several
remarkable fish have been found of the genus named by Agassiz <i>
Cephalaspis,</i> or &ldquo;buckler-headed,&rdquo; from the
extraordinary shield which covers the head (see Fig. 502), and
which has often been mistaken for that of a trilobite, such as <i>
Asaphus.</i> A species of <i>Pteraspis,</i> of the same family, has
also been found by the Reverend Hugh Mitchell in beds of
corresponding age in Perthshire; and Mr. Powrie enumerates no less
than five genera of the family Acanthodid&aelig;, the spines,
scales, and other remains of which have been detected in the grey
flaggy sandstones.*</p>

<p>wing-like form and feather-like ornament of the thoracic
appendage, the part most usually met with. Agassiz, having
previously referred some of these fragments to the class of fishes,
was the first to recognise their crustacean character, and,
although at the time unable correctly to determine the true
relation of the several parts, he figured the portions on which he
founded his opinion, in the first plate of his &ldquo;Poissons
Fossiles du Vieux Gr&egrave;s Rouge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A restoration in correct proportion to the size of the fragments
of <i>P. anglicus</i> (Fig. 504), from the Lower Old Red Sandstone
of Perthshire and Forfarshire, would give us a creature measuring
from five to six feet in length, and more than one foot across.</p>

<p>The largest crustaceans living at the present day are the <i>
Inachus Kaempferi,</i> of De Haan, from Japan (a brachyurous or
short-tailed crab), chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary length
of its limbs; the fore-arm measuring four feet in length, and the
others in proportion, so that it covers about 25 square feet of
ground; and the <i>Limulus Moluccanus,</i> the great King Crab of
China and the Eastern seas, which, when adult, measures 1&frac12;
foot across its carapace, and is three feet in length.</p>

<p>Besides some species of <i>Pterygotus,</i> several of the allied
genus <i>Eurypterus</i> occur in the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and
with them the remains of grass-like plants so abundant in
Forfarshire and Kincardineshire as to be useful to the geologist by
enabling him to identify the inferior strata at distant points.

<p>plants may be of the family <i>Fluviales,</i> and of fresh-water
genera. They are accompanied by fossils, called
&ldquo;berries&rdquo; by the quarrymen, which they compared to a
compressed blackberry (see Figs. 505, 506), and which were called
&ldquo;Parka&rdquo; by Dr. Fleming. They are now considered by Mr.
Powrie to be the eggs of crustaceans, which is highly probable, for
they have not only been found with <i>Pterygotus anglicus</i> in
Forfarshire and Perthshire, but also in the Upper Silurian strata
of England, in which species of the same genus, Pterygotus,
occur.</p>

<p>The grandest exhibitions, says Sir R. Murchison, of the Old Red
Sandstone in England and Wales appear in the escarpments of the
Black Mountains and in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthen, the one
2862, and the other 2590 feet above the sea. The mass of red and
brown sandstone in these mountains is estimated at not less than
10,000 feet, clearly intercalated between the Carboniferous and
Silurian strata. No shells or corals have ever been found in the
whole series, not even where the beds are calcareous, forming
irregular courses of concretionary lumps called
&ldquo;corn-stones,&rdquo; which may be described as mottled red
and green earthy limestones. The fishes of this lowest English Old
Red are <i>Cephalaspis</i> and <i>Pteraspis,</i> specifically
different from species of the same genera which occur in the
uppermost Ludlow or Silurian tilestones. Crustaceans also of the
genus <i>Eurypterus</i> are met with.</p>

<p><b>Marine or Devonian Type.</b>&mdash;We may now speak of the
marine type of the British strata intermediate between the
Carboniferous and Silurian, in treating of which we shall find it
much more easy to identify the Upper, Middle, and Lower divisions
with strata of the same age in other countries. It was not until
the year 1836 that Sir R. Murchison and Professor Sedgwick
discovered that the culmiferous or anthracitic shales and
sandstones of North Devon, several thousand feet thick, belonged to
the coal, and that the beds below them, which are of still greater
thickness, and which, like the carboniferous strata, had been
confounded under the general name &ldquo;graywacke,&rdquo; occupied
a geological position corresponding to that of the Old Red
Sandstone already described. In this reform they were aided by a
suggestion of Mr. Lonsdale, who, after studying the Devonshire
fossils, perceived that they belonged to a peculiar
pal&aelig;ontological type of intermediate character between the
Carboniferous and Silurian.</p>

<p>It is in the north of Devon that these formations may best be
studied, where they have been divided into an Upper, Middle, and
Lower Group, and where, although much contorted and folded, they
have for the most part escaped being altered by intrusive
trap-rocks and by granite, which in Dartmoor and the more southern
parts of the same county have often reduced them to a crystalline
or metamorphic state.</p>

<p>in all main points it agrees with the table drawn up in 1864 for
the sixth edition of my &ldquo;Elements.&rdquo; Mr. Etheridge* has
since published an excellent account of the different subdivisions
of the rocks and their fossils, and has also pointed out their
relation to the corresponding marine strata of the Continent. The
slight modifications introduced in my table since 1864 are the
result of a tour made in 1870 in company with Mr. T. Mck. Hughes,
when we had the advantage of Mr. Etheridge&rsquo;s memoir as our
guide.</p>

<p>The place of the sandstones of the Foreland is not yet clearly
made out, as they are cut off by a great fault and disturbance.</p>

<p><b>Upper Devonian Rocks.</b>&mdash;The slates and sandstones of
Barnstaple (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of the preceding section) contain
the shell <i>Spirifera disjuncta,</i> Sowerby (S. Verneuilii,
Murch.), (see Fig. 508), which has a very wide range in Europe,
Asia Minor, and even China; also <i>Strophalosia caperata,</i>
together with the large trilobite <i>Phacops latifrons,</i> Bronn.
(See Fig. 509), which is all but world-wide in its distribution.
The fossils are numerous, and comprise about 150 species of
mollusca, a fifth of which pass up into the overlying Carboniferous
rocks. To this Upper Devonian belong a series of limestones and
slates well developed at Petherwyn, in Cornwall, where they have
yielded 75 species of fossils. The genus of Cephalopoda called <i>
Clymenia</i> (Fig. 510) is represented by no less than eleven
species, and strata occupying the same position in Germany are
called Clymenien-Kalk, or sometimes Cypridinen-Schiefer, on account
of the number of minute bivalve shells of the crustacean called <i>
Cypridina serrato-striata</i> (Fig. 511), which is found in these
beds, in the Rhenish provinces, the Harz, Saxony, and Silesia, as
well as in Cornwall and Belgium.</p>

enumerated by Mr. Etheridge, none of which pass into the
Carboniferous formation. Among the genera we find <i>Favosites,
Heliolites,</i> and <i>Cyathophyllum.</i> The two former genera are
very frequent in Silurian rocks: some few even of the species are
said to be common to the Devonian and Silurian groups, as, for
example, <i>Favosites cervicornis</i> (Fig. 513), one of the
commonest of all</p>

<p>With the above are found no less than eleven genera of
stone-lilies or crinoids, some of them, such as <i>
Cupressocrinites,</i> distinct from any Carboniferous forms. The
mollusks, also, are no less characteristic; of 68 species of
Brachiopoda, ten only are common to the Carboniferous Limestone.
The <i>Stringocephalus Burtini</i> (Fig. 515) and <i>Uncites
Gryphus</i> (Fig. 516) may be mentioned as exclusively Middle
Devonian genera, and extremely characteristic of the same division
in Belgium. The <i>Stringocephalus</i> is also so abundant in the
Middle Devonian of the banks of the Rhine as to have suggested the
name of Stringocephalus Limestone.</p>

<p>The only two species of Brachiopoda common to the Silurian and
Devonian formations are <i>Atrypa reticularis</i> (Fig. 532), which
seems to have been a cosmopolite species, and <i>Strophomena
rhomboidalis.</i></p>

<p>Among the peculiar lamellibranchiate bivalves common to the
Plymouth limestone of Devonshire and the Continent, we find the <i>
Megalodon</i> (Fig. 517). There are also twelve genera of
Gasteropods which have yielded 36 species, four of which pass to
the Carboniferous group, namely <i>Macrocheilus,</i></p>

<p><i>Acroculia, Euomphalus,</i> and <i>Murchisonia.</i> Pteropods

as <i>Cyrtoceras, Gyroceras, Orthoceras,</i> and others, nearly all
of genera distinct from those prevailing in the Upper Devonian
Limestone, or Clymenien-kalk of the Germans already mentioned.
Although but few species of Trilobites occur, the characteristic
<i>Bronteus flabellifer</i> (Fig. 519) is far from rare, and all
collectors are familiar with its fan-like tail. In this same group,
called, as before stated, the Stringocephalus, or Eifel Limestone,
in Germany, several fish remains have been detected, and among
others the remarkable genus Coccosteus, covered with its
tuberculated bony armour; and these ichthyolites serve, as Sir R.
Murchison observes (Siluria, p. 362), to identify this middle
marine Devonian with the Old Red Sandstone of Britain and
Russia.</p>

<p>Beneath the Eifel Limestone (the great central and typical
member of &ldquo;the Devonian&rdquo; on the Continent) lie certain
schists called by German writers &ldquo;Calceola-schiefer,&rdquo;
because they contain in abundance a fossil body of very curious
structure, <i>Calceola sandalina</i> (Fig. 520), which has been
usually considered a brachiopod, but which some naturalists have
lately referred to a Goniophyllum, supposing it to be an abnormal
form of the order <i>Zoantharia rugosa</i> (see <a href=
"images3/fig474.jpg">Fig. 474</a>), differing from all other corals
in being furnished with a strong operculum. This is by no means a
rare fossil in the slaty limestone of South Devon, and, like the
Eifel form, is confined to the middle group of this country.</p>

<p>occurring on the coast at Lynmouth and the neighbourhood, and
called the Lynton Group (see Table <a href="#page 449">p. 449</a>,
form the lowest member of the Devonian in North Devon. Among the 18
species of all classes enumerated by Mr. Etheridge, two-thirds are
common to the Middle Devonian, but only one, the ubiquitous <i>
Atrypa reticularis,</i> can with certainty be identified with
Silurian species. Among the characteristic forms are <i>Alveolites
suborbicularis,</i> also common to this formation in the Rhine, and
<i>Orthis arcuata,</i> very widely spread in the North Devon
localities. But we may expect a large addition to the number of
fossils whenever these strata shall have been carefully searched.
The Spirifer Sandstone of Sandberger, as exhibited in the rocks
bordering the Rhine between Coblentz and Caub, belong to this Lower
division, and the same broad-winged Spirifers distinguish the
Devonian strata of North America.</p>

<p>Among the Trilobites of this era several large species of <i>
Homalonotus</i> (Fig. 522) are conspicuous. The genus is still
better known as a Silurian form, but the spinose species appear to
belong exclusively to the &ldquo;Lower Devonian,&rdquo; and are
found in Britain, Europe, and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><b>Devonian of Russia.</b>&mdash;The Devonian strata of Russia
extend, according to Sir R. Murchison, over a region more spacious
than the British Isles; and it is remarkable that, where they
consist of sandstone like the &ldquo;Old Red&rdquo; of Scotland and
Central England, they are tenanted by fossil fishes often of the
same species and still oftener of the same genera as the British,
whereas when they consist of limestone they contain shells similar
to those of Devonshire, thus confirming, as Sir Roderick has
pointed out, the contemporaneous origin which had been previously
assigned to formations exhibiting two very distinct mineral types
in different parts of Britain.*</p>

<p><b>Devonian Strata in the United States and
Canada.</b>&mdash;Between the Carboniferous and Silurian strata
there intervenes, in the United States and Canada, a great series
of formations referable to the Devonian group, comprising some
strata of marine origin abounding in shells and corals, and others
of shallow-water and littoral origin in which terrestrial plants
abound. The fossils, both of the deep and shallow water strata, are
very analogous to those of Europe, the species being in some cases
the same. In Eastern Canada Sir W. Logan has pointed out that in
the peninsula of Gaspe, south of the estuary of St. Lawrence, a
mass of sandstone, conglomerate, and shale referable to this period
occurs, rich in vegetable remains, together with some fish-spines.
Far down in the sandstones of Gaspe, Dr. Dawson found, in 1869, an
entire specimen of the genus <i>Cephalaspis,</i> a form so
characteristic, as we have already seen, of the Scotch Lower Old
Red Sandstone. Some of the sandstones are ripple-marked, and
towards the upper part of the whole series a thin seam of coal has
been observed, measuring, together with some associated</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 456">[ 456 ]</a></p>

<p>carbonaceous shale, about three inches in thickness. It rests on
an under-clay in which are the roots of Psilophyton (see Fig. 523).
At many other levels rootlets of this same plant have been shown by
Principal Dawson to penetrate the clays, and to play the same part
as do the rootlets of Stigmaria in the coal formation.</p>

<p>We had already learnt from the works of G&ouml;ppert, Unger, and
Bronn that the European plants of the Devonian epoch resemble
generically, with few exceptions, those already known as
Carboniferous; and Dr. Dawson, in 1859, enumerated 32 genera and 69
species which he had then obtained from the State of New York and
Canada. A perusal of his catalogue,* comprising <i>Conifer&aelig;,
Sigillari&aelig;, Calamites, Asterophyllites, Lepidodendra,</i> and
ferns of the genera <i>Cyclopteris, Neuropteris, Sphenopteris,</i>
and others, together with fruits, such as <i>Cardiocarpum</i> and
<i>Trigonocarpum,</i> might dispose geologists to believe that they
were presented with a list of Carboniferous fossils, the difference
of the species from those of the coal-measures, and even a slight
admixture of genera unknown in Europe, being naturally ascribed to
geographical distribution and the distance of the New from the Old
World. But fortunately the coal formation is fully developed on the
other side of the Atlantic, and is singularly like that of Europe,
both lithologically and in the species of its fossil plants. There
is also the most unequivocal evidence of relative age afforded by
superposition, for the Devonian strata in the United States are
seen to crop out from beneath the Carboniferous on the borders of
Pennsylvania and New York, where both formations are of great
thickness.</p>

<p>The number of American Devonian plants has now been raised by
Dr. Dawson to 120, to which we may add about 80 from the European
flora of the same age, so that already the vegetation of this
period is beginning to be nearly half as rich as that of the
coal-measures which have been studied for so much longer a time and
over so much wider an area. The Psilophyton above alluded to is
believed by Dr. Dawson to be a lycopodiaceous plant, branching
dichotomously (see <i>P. princeps,</i> Fig. 523), with stems
springing from a rhizome, which last has circular areoles, much
resembling those of Stigmaria, and like it sending forth
cylindrical rootlets. The extreme points of some of the branchlets
are rolled up so as to resemble the croziers or circinate vernation
of ferns; the leaves or bracts, <i>a,</i> supposed to belong to the
same plant, are described by Dawson as having inclosed the
fructification. The remains of <i>Psilophyton princeps</i> have
been traced through</p>

<p class="fnote">* Quart. Geol. Journ., vol. xv, p. 477, 1859; also
vol. xviii, p. 296, 1862.</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 457">[ 457 ]</a></p>

<p>all the members of the Devonian series in America, and Dr.
Dawson has lately recognised it in specimens of Old Red Sandstone
from the north of Scotland.</p>

<p>The monotonous character of the Carboniferous flora might be
explained by imagining that we have only the vegetation handed down
to us of one set of stations, consisting of wide swampy flats. But
Dr. Dawson supposes that the geographical conditions under which
the Devonian plants grew were more varied, and had more of an
upland character. If so, the limitation of this more ancient flora,
represented by so many genera and species, to the gymnospermous and
cryptogamous orders, and the absence or extreme rarity of plants of
higher grade, lead us naturally to speculate on the theory of
progressive development, however difficult it may be to avail
ourselves of this explanation, so long as we meet with even a few
exceptional cases of what may seem to be monocotyledonous or
dicotyledonous exogens.</p>

<p><b>Devonian Insects of Canada.</b>&mdash;The earliest known
insects were brought to light in 1865 in the Devonian strata of St.
John&rsquo;s, New Brunswick, and are referred by Mr. Scudder to
four species of <i>Neuroptera.</i> One of them is a gigantic
Ephemera, and measured five inches in expanse of wing.</p>

<p>Like many other ancient animals, says Dr. Dawson, they show a
remarkable union of characters now found in distinct orders of
insects, or constitute what have been named &ldquo;synthetic
types.&rdquo; Of this kind is a stridulating or musical apparatus
like that of the cricket in an insect otherwise allied to the <i>
Neuroptera.</i> This structure, as Dr. Dawson observes, if rightly
interpreted by Mr. Scudder, introduces us to the sounds of the
Devonian woods, bringing before our imagination the trill and hum
of insect life that enlivened the solitudes of these strange old
forests.</p>
