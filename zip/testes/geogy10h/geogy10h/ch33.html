<p>We have now considered three distinct classes of rocks: first,
the aqueous, or fossiliferous; secondly, the volcanic; and,
thirdly, the Plutonic; and it remains for us to examine those
crystalline (or hypogene) strata to which the name of <i>
metamorphic</i> has been assigned. The last-mentioned term
expresses, as before explained, a theoretical opinion that such
strata, after having been deposited from water, acquired, by the
influence of heat and other causes, a highly crystalline texture.
They who still question this opinion may call the rocks under
consideration the stratified hypogene formations or crystalline
schists.</p>

<p>These rocks, when in their characteristic or normal state, are
wholly devoid of organic remains, and contain no distinct fragments
of other rocks, whether rounded or angular. They sometimes break
out in the central parts of mountain chains, but in other cases
extend over areas of vast dimensions, occupying, for example,
nearly the whole of Norway and Sweden, where, as in Brazil, they
appear alike in the lower and higher grounds. However crystalline
these rocks may become in certain regions, they never, like granite
or trap, send veins into contiguous formations. In Great Britain,
those members of the series which approach most nearly to granite
in their composition, as gneiss, mica-schist, and
hornblende-schist, are confined to the country north of the rivers
Forth and Clyde.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to trace a general order of
succession or superposition in the members of this family;
clay-slate, for example, having been often supposed to hold
invariably a higher geological position than mica-schist, and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 577">[ 577 ]</a></p>

<p>mica-schist to overlie gneiss. But although such an order may
prevail throughout limited districts, it is by no means universal.
To this subject, however, I shall again revert, in Chapter XXXV,
where the chronological relations of the metamorphic rocks are
pointed out.</p>

<p><b>Principal Metamorphic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The following may be
enumerated as the principal members of the metamorphic
class:&mdash;gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist, clay-slate,
chlorite-schist, hypogene or metamorphic limestone, and certain
kinds of quartz-rock or quartzite.</p>

<center><img src="images5/fig622.jpg" width="302" height="176" alt=
"Fig. 622: Fragment of gneiss; section made at right angles to the planes of foliation.">
</center>

<p><i>Gneiss.</i>&mdash;The first of these, gneiss, may be called
stratified&mdash;or by those who object to that term, foliated&mdash;granite,
being formed of the same materials as granite, namely, feldspar,
quartz, and mica. In the specimen in Fig. 622, the white layers
consist almost exclusively of granular feldspar, with here and
there a speck of mica and grain of quartz. The dark layers are
composed of grey quartz and black mica, with occasionally a grain
of feldspar intermixed. The rock splits most easily in the plane of
these darker layers, and the surface thus exposed is almost
entirely covered with shining spangles of mica. The accompanying
quartz, however, greatly predominates in quantity, but the most
ready cleavage is determined by the abundance of mica in certain
parts of the dark layer. Instead of consisting of these thin
lamin&aelig;, gneiss is sometimes simply divided into thick beds,
in which the mica has only a slight degree of parallelism to the
planes of stratification.</p>

<p>Hand specimens may often be obtained from such gneiss which are
undistinguishable from granite, affording an argument to which we
shall allude in the concluding part of this chapter, in favour of
those who regard all granite and syenite not as igneous rocks, but
as aqueous formations so altered as to have lost all signs of their
original stratified arrangement. Gneiss in geology is commonly used
to designate not merely</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 578">[ 578 ]</a></p>

<p>stratified and foliated rocks having the same component
materials as granite or syenite, but also in a wider sense to
embrace the formation with which other members of the metamorphic
series, such as hornblende-schist, may alternate, and which are
then considered subordinate to the true gneiss.</p>

<p>The different varieties of rock allied to gneiss, into which
feldspar enters as an essential ingredient, will be understood by
referring to what was said of granite. Thus, for example,
hornblende may be superadded to mica, quartz, and feldspar, forming
a hornblendic or syenitic gneiss; or talc may be substituted for
mica, constituting talcose gneiss (called stratified protogine by
the French), a rock composed of feldspar, quartz, and talc, in
distinct crystals or grains.</p>

<p><i>Eurite,</i> which has already been mentioned as a Plutonic
rock, occurs also with precisely the same composition in beds
subordinate to gneiss or mica-slate.</p>

<p><i>Hornblende-schist</i> is usually black, and composed
principally of hornblende, with a variable quantity of feldspar,
and sometimes grains of quartz. When the hornblende and feldspar
are in nearly equal quantities, and the rock is not slaty, it
corresponds in character with the greenstones of the trap family,
and has been called &ldquo;primitive greenstone.&rdquo; It may be
termed hornblende rock, or amphibolite. Some of these hornblendic
masses may really have been volcanic rocks, which have since
assumed a more crystalline or metamorphic texture.</p>

<p><i>Serpentine</i> is a greenish rock, a silicate of magnesia, in
which there is sometimes from 30 to 40 per cent of magnesia. It
enters largely into the composition of a trap dike cutting through
Old Red Sandstone in Forfarshire, and in that case is probably an
altered basaltic dike which had contained much olivine. The theory
of its having been originally a volcanic product subsequently
altered by metamorphism may at first sight seem inconsistent with
its occurrence in large and regularly stratified masses in the
metamorphic series in Scotland, as in Aberdeenshire. But it has
been suggested in explanation that such serpentine may have been
originally regularly-bedded trap tuff, and volcanic breccia, with
much olivine, which would still retain a stratified appearance
after their conversion into a metamorphic rock.</p>

<p><i>Actinolite Schist</i> is a slaty foliated rock, composed
chiefly of actinolite, an emerald-green mineral, allied to
hornblende, with some admixture of garnet, mica, and quartz.</p>

<p><i>Mica-schist</i> or <i>Micaceous Schist</i> is, next to
gneiss, one of the most abundant rocks of the metamorphic series.
It is slaty, essentially composed of mica and quartz, the mica</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 579">[ 579 ]</a></p>

<p>sometimes appearing to constitute the whole mass. Beds of pure
quartz also occur in this formation. In some districts, garnets in
regular twelve-sided crystals form an integrant part of
mica-schist. This rock passes by insensible gradations into
clay-slate.</p>

<p><i>Clay-slate&mdash;Argillaceous
Schist&mdash;Argillite.</i>&mdash;This rock sometimes resembles an
indurated clay or shale. It is for the most part extremely fissile,
often affording good roofing-slate. Occasionally it derives a
shining and silky lustre from the minute particles of mica or talc
which it contains. It varies from greenish or bluish-grey to a lead
colour; and it may be said of this, more than of any other schist,
that it is common to the metamorphic and fossiliferous series, for
some clay-slates taken from each division would not be
distinguishable by mineral characters alone. It is not uncommon to
meet with an argillaceous rock having the same composition, without
the slaty cleavage, which may be called argillite.</p>

<p><i>Chlorite Schist</i> is a green slaty rock, in which chlorite
is abundant in foliated plates, usually blended with minute grains
of quartz, or sometimes with feldspar or mica; often associated
with, and graduating into, gneiss and clay-slate.</p>

<p><i>Quartzite,</i> or <i>Quartz Rock,</i> is an aggregate of
grains of quartz which are either in minute crystals, or in many
cases slightly rounded, occurring in regular strata, associated
with gneiss or other metamorphic rocks. Compact quartz, like that
so frequently found in veins, is also found together with granular
quartzite. Both of these alternate with gneiss or mica-schist, or
pass into those rocks by the addition of mica, or of feldspar and
mica.</p>

<p><i>Crystalline,</i> or <i>Metamorphic Limestone.</i>&mdash;This
hypogene rock, called by the earlier geologists <i>primary
limestone,</i> is sometimes a white crystalline granular marble,
which when in thick beds can be used in sculpture; but more
frequently it occurs in thin beds, forming a foliated schist much
resembling in colour and arrangement certain varieties of gneiss
and mica-schist. When it alternates with these rocks, it often
contains some crystals of mica, and occasionally quartz, feldspar,
hornblende, talc, chlorite, garnet, and other minerals. It enters
sparingly into the structure of the hypogene districts of Norway,
Sweden, and Scotland, but is largely developed in the Alps.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Metamorphic Strata.</b>&mdash;Having said thus
much of the mineral composition of the metamorphic rocks, I may
combine what remains to be said of their structure and history with
an account of the opinions entertained of their probable origin. At
the same time, it may be well to</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 580">[ 580 ]</a></p>

<p>forewarn the reader that we are here entering upon ground of
controversy, and soon reach the limits where positive induction
ends, and beyond which we can only indulge in speculations. It was
once a favourite doctrine, and is still maintained by many, that
these rocks owe their crystalline texture, their want of all signs
of a mechanical origin, or of fossil contents, to a peculiar and
nascent condition of the planet at the period of their formation.
The arguments in refutation of this hypothesis will be more fully
considered when I show, in Chapter XXXV, to how many different ages
the metamorphic formations are referable, and how gneiss,
mica-schist, clay-slate, and hypogene limestone (that of Carrara,
for example) have been formed, not only since the first
introduction of organic beings into this planet, but even long
after many distinct races of plants and animals had flourished and
passed away in succession.</p>

<p>The doctrine respecting the crystalline strata implied in the
name metamorphic may properly be treated of in this place; and we
must first inquire whether these rocks are really entitled to be
called stratified in the strict sense of having been originally
deposited as sediment from water. The general adoption by
geologists of the term stratified, as applied to these rocks,
sufficiently attests their division into beds very analogous, at
least in form, to ordinary fossiliferous strata. This resemblance
is by no means confined to the existence in both occasionally of a
laminated structure, but extends to every kind of arrangement which
is compatible with the absence of fossils, and of sand, pebbles,
ripple-mark, and other characters which the metamorphic theory
supposes to have been obliterated by Plutonic action. Thus, for
example, we behold alike in the crystalline and fossiliferous
formations an alternation of beds varying greatly in composition,
colour, and thickness. We observe, for instance, gneiss alternating
with layers of black hornblende-schist or of green chlorite-schist,
or with granular quartz or limestone; and the interchange of these
different strata may be repeated for an indefinite number of times.
In the like manner, mica-schist alternates with chlorite-schist,
and with beds of pure quartz or of granular limestone. We have
already seen that, near the immediate contact of granitic veins and
volcanic dikes, very extraordinary alterations in rocks have taken
place, more especially in the neighbourhood of granite. It will be
useful here to add other illustrations, showing that a texture
undistinguishable from that which characterises the more
crystalline metamorphic formations has actually been superinduced
in strata once fossiliferous.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 581">[ 581 ]</a></p>

<p><b>Fossiliferous Strata rendered metamorphic by intrusive Masses
of Granite.</b>&mdash;In the southern extremity of Norway there is
a large district, on the west side of the fiord of Christiania,
which I visited in 1837 with the late Professor Keilhau, in which
syenitic granite protrudes in mountain masses through fossiliferous
strata, and usually sends veins into them at the point of contact.
The stratified rocks, replete with shells and zoophytes, consist
chiefly of shale, limestone, and some sandstone, and all these are
invariably altered near the granite for a distance of from 50 to
400 yards. The aluminous shales are hardened, and have become
flinty. Sometimes they resemble jasper. Ribboned jasper is produced
by the hardening of alternate layers of green and
chocolate-coloured schist, each stripe faithfully representing the
original lines of stratification. Nearer the granite the schist
often contains crystals of hornblende, which are even met with in
some places for a distance of several hundred yards from the
junction; and this black hornblende is so abundant that eminent
geologists, when passing through the country, have confounded it
with the ancient hornblende-schist, subordinate to the great gneiss
formation of Norway. Frequently, between the granite and the
hornblende-slate above-mentioned, grains of mica and crystalline
feldspar appear in the schist, so that rocks resembling gneiss and
mica-schist are produced. Fossils can rarely be detected in these
schists, and they are more completely effaced in proportion to the
more crystalline texture of the beds, and their vicinity to the
granite.</p>

</center>

<p>In some places the siliceous matter of the schist becomes a
granular quartz; and when hornblende and mica are added, the
altered rock loses its stratification, and passes into a kind of
granite. The limestone, which at points remote</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 582">[ 582 ]</a></p>

<p>from the granite is of an earthy texture and blue colour, and
often abounds in corals, becomes a white granular marble near the
granite, sometimes siliceous, the granular structure extending
occasionally upward of 400 yards from the junction; the corals
being for the most part obliterated, though sometimes preserved,
even in the white marble. Both the altered limestone and hardened
slate contain garnets in many places, also ores of iron, lead, and
copper, with some silver. These alterations occur equally whether
the granite invades the strata in a line parallel to the general
strike of the fossiliferous beds, or in a line at right angles to
their strike, both of which modes of junction will be seen by the
ground-plan in Fig. 623.*</p>

<p>The granite of Cornwall sends forth veins into a coarse
argillaceous-schist, provincially termed killas. This killas is
converted into hornblende-schist near the contact with the veins.
These appearances are well seen at the junction of the granite and
killas, in St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, a small island nearly 300
feet high, situated in the bay, at a distance of about three miles
from Penzance. The granite of Dartmoor, in Devonshire, says Sir H.
De la Beche, has intruded itself into the Carboniferous slate and
slaty sandstone, twisting and contorting the strata, and sending
veins into them. Hence some of the slate rocks have become
&ldquo;micaceous; others more indurated, and with the characters of
mica-slate and gneiss; while others again appear converted into a
hard zoned rock strongly impregnated with
feldspar.&rdquo;&dagger;</p>

<p>We learn from the investigation of M. Dufrenoy that in the
eastern Pyrenees there are mountain masses of granite posterior in
date to the formations called lias and chalk of that district, and
that these fossiliferous rocks are greatly altered in texture, and
often charged with iron-ore, in the neighbourhood of the granite.
Thus in the environs of St. Martin, near St. Paul de Fenouillet,
the chalky limestone becomes more crystalline and saccharoid as it
approaches the granite, and loses all trace of the fossils which it
previously contained in abundance. At some points, also, it becomes
dolomitic, and filled with small veins of carbonate of iron, and
spots of red iron-ore. At Rancie the lias nearest the granite is
not only filled with iron-ore, but charged with pyrites, tremolite,
garnet, and a new mineral somewhat allied to feldspar, called, from
the place in the Pyrenees where it occurs,
&ldquo;couzeranite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hornblende-schist,&rdquo; says Dr. MacCulloch, &ldquo;may
at first have been mere clay; for clay or shale is found altered
by</p>

<p class="fnote">* Keilhau, G&aelig;a Norvegica, pp. 61-63.<br>
&dagger; Geol. Manual, p. 479.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 583">[ 583 ]</a></p>

<p>trap into Lydian stone, a substance differing from
hornblende-schist almost solely in compactness and uniformity of
texture.&rdquo;* &ldquo;In Shetland,&rdquo; remarks the same
author, &ldquo;argillaceous-schist (or clay-slate), when in contact
with granite, is sometimes converted into hornblende-schist, the
schist becoming first siliceous, and ultimately, at the contact,
hornblende-schist.&rdquo; In like manner gneiss and mica-schist may
be nothing more than altered micaceous and argillaceous sandstones,
granular quartz may have been derived from siliceous sandstone, and
compact quartz from the same materials. Clay-slate may be altered
shale, and granular marble may have originated in the form of
ordinary limestone, replete with shells and corals, which have
since been obliterated; and, lastly, calcareous sands and marls may
have been changed into impure crystalline limestones.</p>

<p>The anthracite and plumbago associated with hypogene rocks may
have been coal; for not only is coal converted into anthracite in
the vicinity of some trap dikes, but we have seen that a like
change has taken place generally even far from the contact of
igneous rocks, in the disturbed region of the Appalachians. At
Worcester, in the State of Massachusetts, 45 miles due west of
Boston, a bed of plumbago and impure anthracite occurs,
interstratified with mica-schist. It is about two feet in
thickness, and has been made use of both as fuel, and in the
manufacture of lead pencils. At the distance of 30 miles from the
plumbago, there occurs, on the borders of Rhode Island, an impure
anthracite in slates containing impressions of coal-plants of the
genera <i>Pecopteris, Neuropteris, Calamites,</i> etc. This
anthracite is intermediate in character between that of
Pennsylvania and the plumbago of Worcester, in which last the
gaseous or volatile matter (hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) is to
the carbon only in the proportion of three per cent. After
traversing the country in various directions, I came to the
conclusion that the carboniferous shales or slates with anthracite
and plants, which in Rhode Island often pass into mica-schists,
have at Worcester assumed a perfectly crystalline and metamorphic
texture; the anthracite having been nearly transmuted into that
state of pure carbon which is called plumbago or
graphite.&dagger;</p>

<p>Now the alterations above described as superinduced in rocks by
volcanic dikes and granite veins prove incontestably that powers
exist in nature capable of transforming fossiliferous into
crystalline strata, a very few simple elements</p>

<p>constituting the component materials common to both classes of
rocks. These elements, which are enumerated in the table at <a
href="ch28.html#page 499">p. 499</a>, may be made to form new
combinations by what has been termed Plutonic action, or those
chemical changes which are no doubt connected with the passage of
heat, unusually heated steam and waters, through the strata.</p>

<p><b>Hydrothermal Action, or the Influence of Steam and Gases in
producing Metamorphism.</b>&mdash;The experiments of Gregory Watt,
in fusing rocks in the laboratory, and allowing them to consolidate
by slow cooling, prove distinctly that a rock need not be perfectly
melted in order that a re-arrangement of its component particles
should take place, and a partial crystallisation ensue.* We may
easily suppose, therefore, that all traces of shells and other
organic remains may be destroyed, and that new chemical
combinations may arise, without the mass being so fused as that the
lines of stratification should be wholly obliterated. We must not,
however, imagine that heat alone, such as may be applied to a stone
in the open air, can constitute all that is comprised in Plutonic
action. We know that volcanoes in eruption not only emit fluid
lava, but give off steam and other heated gases, which rush out in
enormous volume, for days, weeks, or years continuously, and are
even disengaged from lava during its consolidation.</p>

<p>We also know that long after volcanoes have spent their force,
hot springs continue for ages to flow out at various points in the
same area. In regions, also, subject to violent earthquakes such
springs are frequently observed issuing from rents, usually along
lines of fault or displacement of the rocks. These thermal waters
are most commonly charged with a variety of mineral ingredients,
and they retain a remarkable uniformity of temperature from century
to century. A like uniformity is also persistent in the nature of
the earthy, metallic, and gaseous substances with which they are
impregnated. It is well ascertained that springs, whether hot or
cold, charged with carbonic acid, especially with hydrofluoric
acid, which is often present in small quantities, are powerful
causes of decomposition and chemical reaction in rocks through
which they percolate.</p>

<p>The changes which Daubr&eacute;e has shown to have been produced
by the alkaline waters of Plombi&egrave;res in the Vosges, are more
especially instructive.&dagger; These waters have a heat of
160&deg; F., or an excess of 109&deg; above the average temperature
of ordinary springs in that district. They were</p>

<p class="fnote">* Phil. Trans., 1804.<br>

1860.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 585">[ 585 ]</a></p>

<p>conveyed by the Romans to baths through long conduits or
aqueducts. The foundations of some of their works consisted of a
bed of concrete made of lime, fragments of brick, and sandstone.
Through this and other masonry the hot waters have been percolating
for centuries, and have given rise to various zeolites&mdash;apophyllite
and chabazite among others; also to calcareous spar, arragonite,
and fluor spar, together with siliceous minerals, such as opal&mdash;all
found in the inter-spaces of the bricks and mortar, or constituting
part of their re-arranged materials. The quantity of heat brought
into action in this instance in the course of 2000 years has, no
doubt, been enormous, but the intensity of it developed at any one
moment has been always inconsiderable.</p>

<p>From these facts and from the experiments and observations of
S&eacute;narmont, Daubr&eacute;e, Delesse, Scheerer, Sorby, Sterry
Hunt, and others, we are led to infer that when in the bowels of
the earth there are large volumes of matter containing water and
various acids intensely heated under enormous pressure, these
subterranean fluid masses will gradually part with their heat by
the escape of steam and various gases through fissures, producing
hot springs; or by the passage of the same through the pores of the
overlying and injected rocks. Even the most compact rocks may be
regarded, before they have been exposed to the air and dried, in
the light of sponges filled with water. According to the
experiments of Henry, water, under a hydrostatic pressure of 96
feet, will absorb three times as much carbonic acid gas as it can
under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere. There are other
gases, as well as the carbonic acid, which water absorbs, and more
rapidly in proportion to the amount of pressure. Although the
gaseous matter first absorbed would soon be condensed, and part
with its heat, yet the continual arrival of fresh supplies from
below might, in the course of ages, cause the temperature of the
water, and with it that of the containing rock, to be materially
raised; the water acts not only as a vehicle of heat, but also by
its affinity for various silicates, which, when some of the
materials of the invaded rocks are decomposed, form quartz,
feldspar, mica, and other minerals. As for quartz, it can be
produced under the influence of heat by water holding alkaline
silicates in solution, as in the case of the Plombi&egrave;res
springs. The quantity of water required, according to
Daubr&eacute;e, to produce great transformations in the mineral
structure of rocks, is very small. As to the heat required,
silicates may be produced in the moist way at about incipient red
heat, whereas to form the same in the dry way would require a much
higher temperature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 586">[ 586 ]</a></p>

<p>M. Fournet, in his description of the metalliferous gneiss near
Clermont, in Auvergne, states that all the minute fissures of the
rock are quite saturated with free carbonic acid gas; which gas
rises plentifully from the soil there and in many parts of the
surrounding country. The various elements of the gneiss, with the
exception of the quartz, are all softened; and new combinations of
the acid with lime, iron, and manganese are continually in
progress.*</p>

<p>The power of subterranean gases is well illustrated by the
stufas of St. Calogero in the Lipari Islands, where the horizontal
strata of tuffs, forming cliffs 200 feet high, have been
discoloured in places by the jets of steam often above the boiling
point, called &ldquo;stufas,&rdquo; issuing from the fissures; and
similar instances are recorded by M. Virlet of corrosion of rocks
near Corinth, and by Dr. Daubeny of decomposition of trachytic
rocks by sulphureted hydrogen and muriatic acid gases in the
Solfatara, near Naples. In all these instances it is clear that the
gaseous fluids must have made their way through vast thicknesses of
porous or fissured rocks, and their modifying influence may spread
through the crust for thousands of yards in thickness.</p>

<p>It has been urged as an argument against the metamorphic theory,
that rocks have a small power of conducting heat, and it is true
that when dry, and in the air, they differ remarkably from metals
in this respect. The syenite of Norway, as we have seen (<a href=
"ch31.html#page 558">p. 558</a>), has sometimes altered
fossiliferous strata both in the direction of their dip and strike
for a distance of a quarter of a mile, but the theory of gneiss and
mica-schist above proposed requires us to imagine that the same
influence has extended through strata miles in thickness. Professor
Bischof has shown what changes may be superinduced, on black marble
and other rocks, by the steam of a hot spring having a temperature
of no more than 133&deg; to 167&deg; Fahrenheit, and we are
becoming more and more acquainted with the prominent part which
water is playing in distributing the heat of the interior through
mountain masses of incumbent strata, and of introducing into them
various mineral elements in a fluid or gaseous state. Such facts
may induce us to consider whether many granites and other rocks of
that class may not sometimes represent merely the extreme of a
similar slow metamorphism. But, on the other hand, the heat of lava
in a volcanic crater when it is white and glowing like the sun must
convince us that the temperature of a column of such a fluid at the
depth of many miles exceeds any heat which can ever be witnessed at
the surface.</p>

<p>That large portions of the Plutonic rocks had been formed under
the influence of such intense heat is in perfect accordance with
their great volume, uniform composition, and absence of
stratification. The forcing also of veins into contiguous
stratified or schistose rocks is a natural consequence of the
hydrostatic pressure to which columns of molten matter many miles
in height must give rise.</p>

<p><b>Objections to the Metamorphic Theory considered.</b>&mdash;It
has been objected to the metamorphic theory that the crystalline
schists contain a considerable proportion of potash and soda,
whilst the sedimentary strata out of which they are supposed to
have been formed are usually wanting in alkaline matter. But this
reasoning proceeds on mistaken data, for clay, marl, shale, and
slate often contain a considerable proportion of alkali, so much so
as to make them frequently unfit to be burnt into bricks or
pottery, and the Old Red Sandstone in Forfarshire and other parts
of Scotland, derived from disintegration of granite, contains much
triturated feldspar rich in potash. In the common salt by which
strata are often largely impregnated, as in Patagonia, much soda is
present, and potash enters largely into the composition of fossil
sea-weeds, and recent analysis has also shown that the
carboniferous strata in England, the Upper and Lower Silurian in
East Canada, and the oldest clay-slates in Norway, all contain as
much alkali as is generally present in metamorphic rocks.</p>

<p>Another objection has been derived from the alternation of
highly crystalline strata with others less crystalline. The heat,
it is said, in its ascent from below, must have traversed the less
altered schists before it reached a higher and more crystalline
bed. In answer to this, it may be observed, that if a number of
strata differing greatly in composition from each other be
subjected to equal quantities of heat, or hydrothermal action,
there is every probability that some will be much more fusible or
soluble than others. Some, for example, will contain soda, potash,
lime, or some other ingredient capable of acting as a flux or
solvent; while others may be destitute of the same elements, and so
refractory as to be very slightly affected by the same causes. Nor
should it be forgotten that, as a general rule, the less
crystalline rocks do really occur in the upper, and the more
crystalline in the lower part of each metamorphic series.</p>
