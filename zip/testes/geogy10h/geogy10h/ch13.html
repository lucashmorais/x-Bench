<p>It will be seen in the description given in the last chapter of
the Post-pliocene formations of the British Isles that they
comprise a large proportion of those commonly termed glacial,
characterised by shells which, although referable to living
species, usually indicate a colder climate than that now belonging
to the latitudes where they occur fossil. But in parts of England,
more especially in Yorkshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, there are
superficial formations of clay with glaciated boulders, and of sand
and pebbles, containing occasional, though rare, patches of shells,
in which the marine fauna begins to depart from that now inhabiting
the neighbouring sea, and comprises some species of mollusca not
yet known as living, as well as extinct varieties of others,
entitling us to class them as Newer Pliocene, although belonging to
the close of that period and chronologically on the verge of the
later or Post-pliocene epoch.</p>

<p><b>Bridlington Drift.</b>&mdash;To this era belongs the
well-known locality of Bridlington, near the mouth of the Humber,
in Yorkshire, where about seventy species or well-marked varieties
of shells have been found on the coast, near the sea-level, in a
bed of sand several feet thick resting on glacial clay with much
chalk d&eacute;bris, and covered by a deposit of purple clay with
glaciated boulders. More than a third of the species in this drift
are now inhabitants of arctic regions, none of them extending
southward to the British seas; which is the more remarkable as
Bridlington is situated in lat. 54&deg;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 190">[ 190 ]</a></p>

<p>north. Fifteen species are British and Arctic, a very few belong
to those species which range south of our British seas. Five
species or well-marked varieties are not known living, namely, the
variety of <i>Astarte borealis</i> (called <i>A. Withami</i>); <i>
A. mutabilis</i>; the sinistral form of <i>Tritonium carinatum,
Cardita analis,</i> and <i>Tellina obliqua,</i> Fig. 120, p. 194.
Mr. Searles Wood also inclines to consider <i>Nucula
Cobboldi&aelig;,</i> Fig. 119, p. 194, now absent from the European
seas and the Atlantic, as specifically distinct from a
closely-allied shell now living in the seas surrounding Vancouver&rsquo;s
Island, which some conchologists regard as a variety. <i>Tellina
obliqua</i> also approaches very near to a shell now living in
Japan.</p>

<p><b>Glacial Drift of Ireland.</b>&mdash;Marine drift containing
the last-mentioned Nucula and other glacial shells reaches a height
of from 1000 to 1200 feet in the county of Wexford, south of
Dublin. More than eighty species have already been obtained from
this formation, of which two, <i>Conovulus pyramidalis</i> and <i>
Nassa monensis,</i> are not known as living; while <i>Turritella
incrassata</i> and <i>Cypr&aelig;a lucida</i> no longer inhabit the
British seas, but occur in the Mediterranean. The great elevation
of these shells, and the still greater height to which the surface
of the rocks in the mountainous regions of Ireland have been
smoothed and striated by ice-action, has led geologists to the
opinion that that island, like the greater part of England and
Scotland, after having been united with the continent of Europe,
from whence it received the plants and animals now inhabiting it,
was in great part submerged. The conversion of this and other parts
of Great Britain into an archipelago was followed by a re-elevation
of land and a second continental period. After all these changes
the final separation of Ireland from Great Britain took place, and
this event has been supposed to have preceded the opening of the
straits of Dover.*</p>

"Fig. 116: Tellina balthica" align="left"> 

<p><b>Drift of Norfolk Cliffs.</b>&mdash;There are deposits of
boulder clay and till in the Norfolk cliffs principally made up of
the waste of white chalk and flints which, in the opinion of Mr.
Searles Wood, jun., and others, are older than the Bridlington
drift, and contain a larger proportion of shells common to the
Norwich and Red Crag, including a certain number</p>

<p class="fnote">* See Antiquity of Man, chap. xiv.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 191">[ 191 ]</a></p>

<p>of extinct forms, but also abounding in <i>Tellina balthica</i>
(<i>T. solidula,</i> Fig. 116), which is found fossil at
Bridlington, and living in our British seas, but wanting in all the
formations, even the newest, afterwards to be described as Crag. As
the greater part of these drifts are barren of organic remains,
their classification is at present a matter of great
uncertainty.</p>

<p>They can nowhere be so advantageously studied as on the coast
between Happisburgh and Cromer. Here we may see vertical cliffs,
sometimes 300 feet and more in height, exposed for a distance of
fifty miles, at the base of which the chalk with flints crops out
in nearly horizontal strata. Beds of gravel and sand repose on this
undisturbed chalk. They are often strangely contorted, and envelop
huge masses or erratics of chalk with layers of vertical flint. I
measured one of these fragments in 1839 at Sherringham, and found
it to be eighty feet in its longest diameter. It has been since
entirely removed by the waves of the sea. In the floor of the chalk
beneath it the layers of flint were horizontal. Such erratics have
evidently been moved bodily from their original site, probably by
the same glacial action which has polished and striated some of the
accompanying granitic and other boulders, occasionally six feet in
diameter, which are imbedded in the drift.</p>

<p><b>Cromer Forest-bed.</b>&mdash;Intervening between these
glacial formations and the subjacent chalk lies what has been
called the Cromer Forest-bed. This buried forest has been traced
from Cromer to near Kessingland, a distance of more than forty
miles, being exposed at certain seasons between high and low water
mark. It is the remains of an old land and estuarine deposit,
containing the submerged stumps of trees standing erect with their
roots in the ancient soil. Associated with the stumps and overlying
them, are lignite beds with fresh-water shells of recent species,
and laminated clay without fossils. Through the lignite and
forest-bed are scattered cones of the Scotch and spruce firs with
the seeds of recent plants, and the bones of at least twenty
species of terrestrial mammalia. Among these are two species of
elephant, <i>E. meridionalis,</i> Nesti, and <i>E. antiquus,</i>
the former found in the Newer Pliocene beds of the Val d&rsquo;Arno, near
Florence. In the same bed occur <i>Hippopotamus major, Rhinoceros
etruscus,</i> both of them also Val d&rsquo;Arno species, many species of
deer considered by Mr. Boyd Dawkins to be characteristic of warmer
countries, and also a horse, beaver, and field-mouse. Half of these
mammalia are extinct, and the rest still survive in Europe. The
vegetation taken alone</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 192">[ 192 ]</a></p>

<p>does not imply a temperature higher than that now prevailing in
the British Isles. There must have been a subsidence of the forest
to the amount of 400 or 500 feet, and a re-elevation of the same to
an equal extent in order to allow the ancient surface of the chalk
or covering of soil, on which the forest grew, to be first covered
with several hundred feet of drift, and then upheaved so that the
trees should reach their present level. Although the relative
antiquity of the forest-bed to the overlying glacial till is clear,
there is some difference of opinion as to its relation to the crag
presently to be described.</p>

<img src="images1/fig117.jpg" width="89" height="133" alt=
"Fig. 117: Natica helicoides" align="left"> 

<p><b>Chillesford and Aldeby Beds.</b>&mdash;It is in the counties
of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, that we obtain our most valuable
information respecting the British Pliocene strata, whether newer
or older. They have obtained in those counties the provincial name
of &ldquo;Crag,&rdquo; applied particularly to masses of shelly sand which have
long been used in agriculture to fertilise soils deficient in
calcareous matter. At Chillesford, between Woodbridge and
Aldborough in Suffolk, and Aldeby, near Beccles, in the same
county, there occur stratified deposits, apparently older than any
of the preceding drifts of Yorkshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. They
are composed at Chillesford of yellow sands and clays, with much
mica, forming horizontal beds about twenty feet thick. Messrs.
Prestwich and Searles Wood, senior, who first described these beds,
point out that the shells indicate on the whole a colder climate
than the Red Crag; two-thirds of them being characteristic of high
latitudes. Among these are <i>Cardium Gr&oelig;nlandicum, Leda
limatula, Tritonium carinatum,</i> and <i>Scalaria
Gr&oelig;nlandica.</i> In the upper part of the laminated clays a
skeleton of a whale was found associated with casts of the
characteristic shells, <i>Nucula Cobboldi&aelig;</i> and <i>Tellina
obliqua,</i> already referred to as no longer inhabiting our seas,
and as being extinct varieties if not species. The same shells
occur in a perfect state in the lower part of the formation. <i>
Natica helicoides</i> (Fig. 117) is an example of a species
formerly known only as fossil, but which has now been found living
in our seas.</p>

<p>At Aldeby, where beds occur decidedly similar in mineral
character as well as fossil remains, Messrs. Crowfoot and Dowson
have now obtained sixty-six species of mollusca, comprising the
Chillesford species and some others. Of these about nine-tenths are
recent. They are in a perfect state, clearly indicating a cold
climate; as two-thirds of them are now met with in arctic</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 193">[ 193 ]</a></p>

<p>regions. As a rule, the lamellibranchiate molluscs have both
valves united, and many of them, such as <i>Mya arenaria,</i> stand
with the siphonal end upward, as when in a living state. <i>Tellina
balthica,</i> before mentioned (Fig. 116) as so characteristic of
the glacial beds, including the drift of Bridlington, has not yet
been found in deposits of Chillesford and Aldeby age, whether at
Sudbourn, East Bavent, Horstead, Coltishall, Burgh, or in the
highest beds overlying the Norwich Crag proper at Bramerton and
Thorpe.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Norwich or Fluvio-marine Crag.</b>&mdash;The beds above
alluded to ought, perhaps, to be regarded as beds of passage
between the glacial formations and those called from a provincial
name &ldquo;Crag,&rdquo; the newest member of which has been commonly called
the &ldquo;Norwich Crag.&rdquo; It is chiefly seen in the neighbourhood of
Norwich, and consists of beds of incoherent sand, loam, and gravel,
which are exposed to view on both banks of the Yare, as at
Bramerton and Thorpe. As they contain a mixture of marine, land,
and fresh-water shells, with bones of fish and mammalia, it is
clear that these beds have been accumulated at the bottom of a sea
near the mouth of a river. They form patches rarely exceeding
twenty feet in thickness, resting on white chalk. At their junction
with the chalk there invariably intervenes a bed called the
&ldquo;Stone-bed,&rdquo; composed of unrolled chalk-flints, commonly of large
size, mingled with the remains of a land fauna comprising <i>
Mastodon arvernensis, Elephas meridionalis,</i> and an extinct
species of deer. The mastodon, which is a species characteristic of
the Pliocene strata of Italy and France, is the most abundant
fossil, and one not found in the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 194">[ 194 ]</a></p>

<p>Cromer forest before mentioned. When these flints, probably long
exposed in the atmosphere, became submerged, they were covered with
barnacles, and the surface of the chalk became perforated by the
<i>Pholas crispata,</i> each fossil shell still remaining at the
bottom of its cylindrical cavity, now filled up with loose sand
from the incumbent crag. This species of Pholas still exists, and
drills the rocks between high and low water on the British coast.
The name of &ldquo;Fluvio-marine&rdquo; has often been given to this formation,
as no less than twenty species of land and fresh-water shells have
been found in it. They are all of living species; at least only one
univalve, <i>Paludina lenta,</i> has any, and that a very doubtful,
claim to be regarded as extinct.</p>

<center><img src="images1/fig119.jpg" width="335" height="123" alt=
"Fig. 119: Nucula Cobboldi&aelig;; Fig. 120: Tellina obliqua.">
</center>

<p>Of the marine shells, 124 in number, about 18 per cent are
extinct, according to the latest estimate given me by Mr. Searles
Wood; but, for reasons presently to be mentioned, this percentage
must be only regarded as provisional. It must also be borne in mind
that the proportion of recent shells would be augmented if the
uppermost beds at Bramerton, near Norwich, which belong to the most
modern or Chillesford division of the Crag, had been included, as
they were formerly, by Mr. Woodward and myself, in the Norwich
series. Arctic shells, which formed so large a proportion in the
Chillesford and Aldeby beds, are more rare in the Norwich Crag,
though many northern species--such as <i>Rhynchonella psittacea,
Scalaria Gr&oelig;nlandica, Astarte borealis, Panop&aelig;a
Norvegia,</i> and others--still occur. The <i>Nucula
Cobboldi&aelig;</i> and <i>Tellina obliqua,</i> Figs. 119 and 120,
before mentioned, p. 194, are frequent in these beds, as are also
<i>Littorina littorea, Cardium edule,</i> and <i>Turritella
communis,</i> of our seas, proving the littoral origin of the
beds.</p>

<br>
 

<center>OLDER PLIOCENE STRATA.</center>

<p><b>Red Crag.</b>&mdash;Among the English Pliocene beds the next
in antiquity is the Red Crag, which often rests immediately on the
London Clay, as in the county of Essex, illustrated in Fig.
121.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 195">[ 195 ]</a></p>

<center><img src="images1/fig121.jpg" width="339" height="76" alt=
" Fig. 121: Red Crag, London clay and chalk."></center>

<p>It is chiefly in the county of Suffolk that it is found, rarely
exceeding twenty feet in thickness, and sometimes overlying another
Pliocene deposit, the Coralline Crag, to be mentioned in the
sequel. It has yielded--exclusive of 25 species regarded by Mr.
Wood as derivative--256 species of mollusca, of which 65, or 25 per
cent, are extinct. Thus, apart from its order of superposition, its
greater antiquity than the Norwich and glacial beds, already
described, is proved by the greater departure from the fauna of our
seas. It may also be observed that in most of the deposits of this
Red Crag, the northern forms of the Norwich Crag, and of such
glacial formations as Bridlington, are less numerous, while those
having a more southern aspect begin to make their appearance. Both
the quartzose sand, of which it chiefly consists, and the included
shells, are most commonly distinguished by a deep ferruginous or
ochreous colour, whence its name. The shells are often rolled,
sometimes comminuted, and the beds have much the appearance of
having been shifting sand-banks, like those now forming on the
Dogger-bank, in the sea, sixty miles east of the coast of
Northumberland. Cross stratification is almost always present, the
planes of the strata being sometimes directed towards one point of
the compass, sometimes to the opposite, in beds immediately
overlying. That such a structure is not deceptive or due to any
subsequent concretionary rearrangement of particles, or to mere
bands of colour produced by the iron, is proved by each bed being
made up of flat pieces of shell which lie parallel to the planes of
the smaller strata.</p>

<p>It has long been suspected that the different patches of Red
Crag are not all of the same age, although their chronological
relation can not be decided by superposition. Separate masses are
characterised by shells specifically distinct or greatly varying in
relative abundance, in a manner implying that the deposits
containing them were separated by intervals of time. At Butley,
Tunstall, Sudbourn, and in the Red Crag of Chillesford, the
mollusca appear to assume their most modern aspect when the climate
was colder than when the earliest deposits of the same period were
formed. At Butley, <i>Nucula Cobboldi&aelig;</i>, so common in the
Norwich and certain glacial beds, is found, and <i>Purpura
tetragona</i> (Fig. 122) is very abundant. On the other hand, at
Walton-on-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 196">[ 196 ]</a></p>

<img src="images1/fig122.jpg" width="97" height="208" alt=
"Fig. 122: Purpura tetragona." align="left"> 

<p>the-Naze, in Essex, we seem to have an exhibition of the oldest
phase of the Red Crag; and a warmer climate seems indicated, not
only by the absence of many northern forms, but also by the
abundance of some now living in the British seas and the
Mediterranean. <i>Voluta Lamberti</i> (see Figs. 123 and 124), an
extinct form, which seems to have flourished chiefly in the
antecedent Coralline Crag period, is still represented here by
individuals of every age.</p>

<p>The reversed whelk (Fig. 125) is common at Walton, where the
dextral form of that shell is unknown. Here also we find most
frequently specimens of lamellibranchiate molluscs, with both the
valves united, showing that they belonged to this sea of the Upper
Crag, and were not washed in from an older bed, such as the
Coralline, in which case the ligament would not have held together
the valves in strata so often showing signs of the boisterous
action of the waves. No less than forty species of
lamellibranchiate molluscs, with double valves, have been collected
by Mr. Bell from the various localities of the Red Crag.</p>

"Fig. 123: Voluta Lamberti; Fig. 124: Voluta Lamberti; Fig. 125: Trophon antiquum.">
</center>

<p>At and near the base of the Red Crag is a loose bed of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 197">[ 197 ]</a></p>

<p>brown nodules, first noticed by Professor Henslow as containing
a large percentage of earthy phosphates. This bed of coprolites (as
it is called, because they were originally supposed to be the
f&aelig;ces of animals) does not always occur at one level, but is
generally in largest quantity at the junction of the Crag and the
underlying formation. In thickness it usually varies from six to
eighteen inches, and in some rare cases amounts to many feet. It
has been much used in agriculture for manure, as not only the
nodules, but many of the separate bones associated with them, are
largely impregnated with phosphate of lime, of which there is
sometimes as much as sixty per cent. They are not unfrequently
covered with barnacles, showing that they were not formed as
concretions in the stratum where they now lie buried, but had been
previously consolidated. The phosphatic nodules often collect
fossil crabs and fishes from the London Clay, together with the
teeth of gigantic sharks. In the same bed have been found many
ear-bones of whales, and the teeth of <i>Mastodon arvernensis,
Rhinoceros Schleiermacheri, Tapirus priscus,</i> and Hipparion (a
quadruped of the horse family), and antlers of a stag, <i>Cervus
anoceros.</i> Organic remains also of the older chalk and Lias are
met with, showing how great was the denudation of previous
formations during the Pliocene period. As the older White Crag,
presently to be mentioned, contains similar phosphatic nodules near
its base, those of the Red Crag may be partly derived from this
source.</p>

<p><b>White or Coralline Crag.</b>&mdash;The lower or Coralline
Crag is of very limited extent, ranging over an area about twenty
miles in length, and three or four in breadth, between the rivers
Stour and Alde, in Suffolk. It is generally calcareous and
marly--often a mass of comminuted shells, and the remains of
bryozoa* (or polyzoa), passing occasionally into a soft
building-stone. At Sudbourn and Gedgrave, near Orford, this
building-stone has been largely quarried. At some places in the
neighbourhood the softer mass is divided by thin flags of hard
limestone, and bryozoa placed in the upright position in which they
grew. From the abundance of these coralloid mollusca the lowest or
White Crag obtained its popular name, but true corals, as now
defined, or zoantharia, are very rare in this formation.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Ehrenberg proposed in 1831 the term <i>
Bryozoum</i>, or &ldquo;Moss-animal,&rdquo; for the molluscous or ascidian form
of polyp, characterised by having two openings to the digestive
sack, as in <i>Eschara, Flustra, Retepora,</i> and other zoophytes
popularly included in the corals, but now classed by naturalists as
mollusca. The term <i>Polyzoum,</i> synonymous with <i>
Bryozoum,</i> was, it seems, proposed in 1830, or the year before,
by Mr. J. O. Thompson.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 198">[ 198 ]</a></p>

<p>The Coralline Crag rarely, if ever, attains a thickness of
thirty feet in any one section. Mr. Prestwich imagines that if the
beds found at different localities were united in the probable
order of their succession, they might exceed eighty feet in
thickness, but Mr. Searles Wood does not believe in the possibility
of establishing such a chronological succession by aid of the
organic remains, and questions whether proof could be obtained of
more than forty feet. I was unable to come to any satisfactory
opinion on the subject, although at Orford, especially at Gedgrave,
in the neighbourhood of that place, I saw many sections in pits,
where this crag is cut through. These pits are so unconnected, and
of such limited extent, that no continuous section of any length
can be obtained, so that speculations as to the thickness of the
whole deposit must be very vague. At the base of the formation at
Sutton a bed of phosphatic nodules, very similar to that before
alluded to in the Red Crag, with remains of mammalia, has been met
with.</p>

<center><img src="images1/fig126.jpg" width="336" height="107" alt=
"Fig. 126: Section near Woodbridge, in Suffolk."></center>

<p>Whenever the Red and Coralline Crag occur in the same district,
the Red Crag lies uppermost; and in some cases, as in the section
represented in Fig. 126, which I had an opportunity of seeing
exposed to view in 1839, it is clear that the older deposit, or
Coralline Crag, <i>b</i>, had suffered denudation, before the newer
formation, <i>a</i>, was thrown down upon it. At D there was not
only seen a distinct cliff, eight or ten feet high, of Coralline
Crag, running in a direction N.E. and S.W., against which the Red
Crag abuts with its horizontal layers, but this cliff occasionally
overhangs. The rock composing it is drilled everywhere by <i>
Pholades</i>, the holes which they perforated having been
afterwards filled with sand, and covered over when the newer beds
were thrown down. The older formation is shown by its fossils to
have accumulated in a deeper sea, and contains none of those
littoral forms such as the limpet, <i>Patella</i>, found in the Red
Crag. So great an amount of denudation could scarcely take place,
in such incoherent materials, without some of the fossils of the
inferior beds becoming mixed up with the overlying crag, so that
considerable difficulty must be occasionally experienced by</p>

</center>

<p>Mr. Searles Wood estimates the total number of marine testaceous
mollusca of the Coralline Crag at 350, of which 110 are not known
as living, being in the proportion of thirty-one per cent extinct.
No less than 130 species of bryozoa have been found in the
Coralline Crag, and some belong to genera unknown in the living
creation, and of a very peculiar structure; as, for example, that
represented in Fig. 127, which is one of several species having a
globular form. Among the testacea the genus <i>Astarte</i> (see
Fig. 128) is largely represented, no less than fourteen species
being known, and many of these being rich in individuals. There is
an absence of genera peculiar to hot climates, such as <i>Conus,
Oliva, Fasciolaria, Crassatella</i>, and others. The absence also
of large cowries (<i>Cyprea</i>), those found belonging</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 200">[ 200 ]</a></p>

<p>exclusively to the section <i>Trivia</i>, is remarkable. The
large volute, called <i>Voluta Lamberti</i> (Fig. 123, p. 196), may
seem an exception; but it differs in form from the volutes of the
torrid zone, and, like the living <i>Voluta Magellanica</i>, must
have been fitted for an extra-tropical climate.</p>

<p>The occurrence of a species of <i>Lingula</i> at Sutton (see
Fig. 129) is worthy of remark, as these <i>Brachiopoda</i> seem now
confined to more equatorial latitudes; and the same may be said
still more decidedly of a species of <i>Pyrula</i>, supposed by Mr.
Wood to be identical with <i>P. reticulata</i> (Fig. 130), now
living in the Indian Ocean. A genus also of echinoderms, called by
Professor Forbes <i>Temnechinus</i> (Fig. 131), occurs in the Red
and Coralline Crag of Suffolk, and until lately was unknown in a
living state, but it has been brought to light as an existing form
by the deep-sea dredgings, both of the United States survey, off
Florida, at a depth of from 180 to 480 feet, and more recently
(1869), in the British seas, during the explorations of the
&ldquo;Porcupine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Climate of the Crag Deposits.</b>&mdash;One of the most
interesting conclusions deduced from a careful comparison of the
shells of the British Pliocene strata and the fauna of our present
seas has been pointed out by Professor E. Forbes. It appears that,
during the Glacial period, a period intermediate, as we have seen,
between that of the Crag and our own time, many shells, previously
established in the temperate zone, retreated southward to avoid an
uncongenial climate, and they have been found fossil in the Newer
Pliocene strata of Sicily, Southern Italy, and the Grecian
Archipelago, where they may have enjoyed, during the era of
floating icebergs, a climate resembling that now prevailing in
higher European latitudes.* The Professor gave a list of fifty
shells which inhabited the British seas while the Coralline and Red
Crag were forming, and which, though now living in our seas,</p>

i, p. 386.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 201">[ 201 ]</a></p>

<p>were wanting, as far as was then known, in the glacial deposits.
Some few of these species have subsequently been found in the
glacial drift, but the general conclusion of Forbes remains
unshaken.</p>

<p>The transport of blocks by ice, when the Red Crag was being
deposited, appears to me evident from the large size of some huge,
irregular, quite unrounded chalk flints, retaining their white
coating, and 2 feet long by 18 inches broad, in beds worked for
phosphatic nodules at Foxhall, four miles south-east of Ipswich.
These must have been tranquilly drifted to the spot by floating
ice. Mr. Prestwich also mentions the occurrence of a large block of
porphyry in the base of the Coralline Crag at Sutton, which would
imply that the ice-action had begun in our seas even in this older
period. The cold seems to have gone on increasing from the time of
the Coralline to that of the Norwich Crag, and became more and more
severe, not perhaps without some oscillations of temperature, until
it reached its maximum in what has been called the Glacial period,
or at the close of the Newer Pliocene, and in the Post-pliocene
periods.</p>

<p><b>Relation of the Fauna of the Crag to that of the recent
Seas.</b>&mdash;By far the greater number of the recent marine
species occurring in the several Crag formations are still
inhabitants of the British seas; but even these differ considerably
in their relative abundance, some of the commonest of the Crag
shells being now extremely scarce--as, for example, <i>Buccinum
Dalei</i>--while others, rarely met with in a fossil state, are now
very common, as <i>Murex erinaceus</i> and <i>Cardium
echinatum.</i> Some of the species also, the identity of which with
the living would not be disputed by any conchologist, are
nevertheless distinguishable as varieties, whether by slight
deviations in form or a difference in average dimensions. Since Mr.
Searles Wood first described the marine testacea of the Crags, the
additions made to that fossil fauna have not been considerable,
whereas we have made in the same period immense progress in our
knowledge of the living testacea of the British and arctic seas,
and of the Mediterranean. By this means the naturalist has been
enabled to identify with existing species many forms previously
supposed to be extinct.</p>

<p>In the forthcoming supplement to the invaluable monograph
communicated by Mr. Wood to the Pal&aelig;ontographical Society, in
which he has completed his figures and descriptions of the British
crag shells of every age, list will be found of all the fossil
shells, of which a summary is given in the table, p. 202.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 202">[ 202 ]</a></p>

<p>To begin with the uppermost or Chillesford beds, it will be seen
that about 9 per cent only are extinct, or not known as living,
whereas in the Norwich, which succeeds in the descending order,
seventeen in a hundred are extinct. Formerly, when the Norwich or
Fluvio-marine Crag was spoken of, both these formations were
included under the same head, for both at Bramerton and Thorpe, the
chief localities where the Norwich Crag was studied, an overlying
deposit occurs referable to the Chillesford age. If now the two
were fused together as of old, their shells would, according to Mr.
Wood, yield a percentage of fifteen in a hundred of species extinct
or not known as living.</p>

<p>To come next to the Red Crag, the reader will observe that a
percentage of 25 is given of shells unknown as living, and this
increases to 31 in the antecedent Coralline Crag. But the gap
between these two stages of our Pliocene deposits is really wider
than these numbers would indicate, for several reasons. In the
first place, the Coralline Crag is more strictly the product of a
single period, the Red Crag, as we have seen, consisting of
separate and independent patches, slightly varying in age, of which
the newest is probably not much anterior to the Norwich Crag.
Secondly, there was a great change of conditions, both as to
the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 203">[ 203 ]</a></p>

<p>depth of the sea and climate, between the periods of the
Coralline and Red Crag, causing the fauna in each to differ far
more widely than would appear from the above numerical results.</p>

<p>The value of the analysis given in the above table of the shells
of the Red and Coralline Crags is in no small degree enhanced by
the fact that they were all either collected by Mr. Wood himself,
or obtained by him direct from their discoverers, so that he was
enabled in each case to test their authenticity, and as far as
possible to avoid those errors which arise from confounding
together shells belonging to the sea of a newer deposit, and those
washed into it from a formation of older date. The danger of this
confusion may be conceived when we remember that the number of
species rejected from the Red Crag as derivative by Mr. Wood is no
less than 25. Some geologists have held that on the same grounds it
is necessary to exclude as spurious some of the species found in
the Norwich Crag proper; but Mr. Wood does not entertain this view,
believing that the spurious shells which have sometimes found their
way into the lists of this crag have been introduced by want of
care from strata of Red Crag.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, on the other hand, that conchologists
have occasionally rejected from the Red and Norwich Crags, as
derivative, shells which really belonged to the seas of those
periods, because they were extinct or unknown as living, which in
their eyes afforded sufficient ground for suspecting them to be
intruders. The derivative origin of a species may sometimes be
indicated by the extreme scarcity of the individuals, their colour,
and worn condition; whereas an opposite conclusion may be arrived
at by the integrity of the shells, especially when they are of
delicate and tender structure, or their abundance, and, in the case
of the lamellibranchiata, by their being held together by the
ligament, which often happens when the shells have been so broken
that little more than the hinges of the two valves are preserved.
As to the univalves, I have seen from a pit of Red Crag, near
Woodbridge, a large individual of the extinct <i>Voluta
Lamberti</i>, seven inches in length, of which the lip, then
perfect, had in former stages of its growth been frequently broken,
and as often repaired. It had evidently lived in the sea of the Red
Crag, where it had been exposed to rough usage, and sustained
injuries like those which the reversed whelk, <i>Trophon
antiquum</i>, so characteristic of the same formation, often
exhibits. Additional proofs, however, have lately been obtained by
Mr. Searles Wood that this</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 204">[ 204 ]</a></p>

<p>shell had not died out in the era of the Red Crag by the
discovery of the same fossil near Southwold, in beds of the later
Norwich Crag.</p>

<p><b>Antwerp Crag.</b>&mdash;Strata of the same age as the Red and
Coralline Crag of Suffolk have been long known in the country round
Antwerp, and on the banks of the Scheldt, below that city; and the
lowest division, or Black Crag, there found, is shown by the shells
to be somewhat more ancient than any of our British series, and
probably forms the first links of a downward passage from the
strata of the Pliocene to those of the Upper Miocene period.</p>

<img src="images1/fig132.jpg" width="90" height="213" alt=
"Fig. 132: Murex vaginatus" align="left"> 

<p><b>Newer Pliocene Strata of Sicily.</b>&mdash;At several points
north of Catania, on the eastern sea-coast of Sicily--as at
Aci-Castello, for example, Trezza, and Nizzeti--marine strata,
associated with volcanic tuffs and basaltic lavas, are seen, which
belong to a period when the first igneous eruptions of Mount Etna
were taking place in a shallow bay of the Mediterranean. They
contain numerous fossil shells, and out of 142 species that have
been collected all but eleven are identical with species now
living. Some few of these eleven shells may possibly still linger
in the depths of the Mediterranean, like <i>Murex vaginatus</i>,
see Fig. 132. The last-mentioned shell had already become rare when
the associated marine and volcanic strata above alluded to were
formed. On the whole, the modern character of the testaceous fauna
under consideration is expressed not only by the small proportion
of extinct species, but by the relative number of individuals by
which most of the other species are represented, for the proportion
agrees with that observed in the present fauna of the
Mediterranean. The rarity of individuals in the extinct species is
such as to imply that they were already on the point of dying out,
having flourished chiefly in the earlier Pliocene times, when the
Subapennine strata were in progress.</p>

<p>Yet since the accumulation of these Newer Pliocene sands and
clays, the whole cone of Etna, 11,000 feet in height and about 90
miles in circumference at its base, has been slowly built up; an
operation requiring many tens of thousands of years for its
accomplishment, and to estimate the magnitude of which it is
necessary to study in detail the internal structure of the
mountain, and to see the proofs of its double axis, or the evidence
of the lavas of the present great centre of eruption having
gradually overwhelmed and enveloped a</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 205">[ 205 ]</a></p>

<p>more ancient cone, situated 3&frac12; miles to the east of the
present one.*</p>

<p>It appears that while Etna was increasing in bulk by a series of
eruptions, its whole mass, comprising the foundations of subaqueous
origin above alluded to, was undergoing a slow upheaval, by which
those marine strata were raised to the height of 1200 feet above
the sea, as seen at Catera, and perhaps to greater heights, for we
can not trace their extension westward, owing to the dense and
continuous covering of modern lava under which they are buried.
During the gradual rise of these Newer Pliocene formations
(consisting of clays, sands, and basalts) other strata of
Post-pliocene date, marine as well as fluviatile, accumulated round
the base of the mountain, and these, in their turn, partook of the
upward movement, so that several inland cliffs and terraces at low
levels, due partly to the action of the sea and partly to the river
Simeto, originated in succession. Fossil remains of the elephant,
and other extinct quadrupeds, have been found in these
Post-Pliocene strata, associated with recent shells.</p>

<p>There is probably no part of Europe where the Newer Pliocene
formations enter so largely into the structure of the earth&rsquo;s
crust, or rise to such heights above the level of the sea, as
Sicily. They cover nearly half the island, and near its centre, at
Castrogiovanni, reach an elevation of 3000 feet. They consist
principally of two divisions, the upper calcareous and the lower
argillaceous, both of which may be seen at Syracuse, Girgenti, and
Castrogiovanni. According to Philippi, to whom we are indebted for
the best account of the tertiary shells of this island, thirty-five
species out of one hundred and twenty-four obtained from the beds
in central Sicily are extinct.</p>

<p>A geologist, accustomed to see nearly all the Newer Pliocene
formations in the north of Europe occupying low grounds and very
incoherent in texture, is naturally surprised to behold formations
of the same age so solid and stony, of such thickness, and
attaining so great an elevation above the level of the sea. The
upper or calcareous member of this group in Sicily consists in some
places of a yellowish-white stone, like the Calcaire Grossier of
Paris; in others, of a rock nearly as compact as marble. Its
aggregate thickness amounts sometimes to 700 or 800 feet. It
usually occurs in regular horizontal beds, and is occasionally
intersected by deep valleys, such as those of Sortino and
Pentalica,</p>

<p class="fnote">* See a Memoir on the Lavas and Mode of Origin of
Mount Etna by the Author in Phil. Trans., 1858.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 206">[ 206 ]</a></p>

<p>in which are numerous caverns. The fossils are in every stage of
preservation, from shells retaining portions of their animal matter
and colour to others which are mere casts. The limestone passes
downward into a sandstone and conglomerate, below which is clay and
blue marl, from which perfect shells and corals may be disengaged.
The clay sometimes alternates with yellow sand.</p>

<p>South of the plain of Catania is a region in which the tertiary
beds are intermixed with volcanic matter, which has been for the
most part the product of submarine eruptions. It appears that,
while the clay, sand, and yellow limestone before mentioned were in
course of deposition at the bottom of the sea, volcanoes burst out
beneath the waters, like that of Graham Island, in 1831, and these
explosions recurred again and again at distant intervals of time.
Volcanic ashes and sand were showered down and spread by the waves
and currents so as to form strata of tuff, which are found
intercalated between beds of limestone and clay containing marine
shells, the thickness of the whole mass exceeding 2000 feet. The
fissures through which the lava rose may be seen in many places,
forming what are called <i>dikes.</i></p>

<center><img src="images1/fig133.jpg" width="336" height="321" alt=
"Fig. 133: Pecten jacob&aelig;us"></center>

<p>No shell is more conspicuous in these Sicilian strata than the
great scallop, <i>Pecten jacob&aelig;us</i> (Fig. 133), now so
common in the neighbouring seas. The more we reflect on the
preponderating number of this and other recent shells, the more</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 207">[ 207 ]</a></p>

<p>we are surprised at the great thickness, solidity, and height
above the sea of the rocky masses in which they are entombed, and
the vast amount of geographical change which has taken place since
their origin. It must be remembered that, before they began to
emerge, the uppermost strata of the whole must have been deposited
under water. In order, therefore, to form a just conception of
their antiquity, we must first examine singly the innumerable
minute parts of which the whole is made up, the successive beds of
shells, corals, volcanic ashes, conglomerates, and sheets of lava;
and we must afterwards contemplate the time required for the
gradual upheaval of the rocks, and the excavation of the valleys.
The historical period seems scarcely to form an appreciable unit in
this computation, for we find ancient Greek temples, like those of
Girgenti (Agrigentum), built of the modern limestone of which we
are speaking, and resting on a hill composed of the same; the site
having remained to all appearances unaltered since the Greeks first
colonised the island.</p>

<p>It follows, from the modern geological date of these rocks, that
the fauna and flora of a large part of Sicily are of higher
antiquity than the country itself. The greater part of the island
has been raised above the sea since the epoch of existing species,
and the animals and plants now inhabiting it must have migrated
from adjacent countries, with whose productions the species are now
identical. The average duration of species would seem to be so
great that they are destined to outlive many important changes in
the configuration of the earth&rsquo;s surface, and hence the necessity
for those innumerable contrivances by which they are enabled to
extend their range to new lands as they are formed, and to escape
from those which sink beneath the sea.</p>

<p><b>Newer Pliocene Strata of the Upper Val D&rsquo;arno.</b>&mdash;When
we ascend the Arno for about ten miles above Florence, we arrive at
a deep narrow valley called the Upper Val d&rsquo;Arno, which appears
once to have been a lake, at a time when the valley below Florence
was an arm of the sea. The horizontal lacustrine strata of this
upper basin are twelve miles long and two broad. The depression
which they fill has been excavated out of Eocene and Cretaceous
rocks, which form everywhere the sides of the valley in highly
inclined stratification. The thickness of the more modern and
unconformable beds is about 750 feet, of which the upper 200 feet
consist of Newer Pliocene strata, while the lower are Older
Pliocene. The newer series are made up of sands and a conglomerate
called &ldquo;sansino.&rdquo; Among the imbedded fossil</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 208">[ 208 ]</a></p>

<p>mammalia are <i>Mastodon arvernensis, Elephas meridionalis,
Rhinoceros etruscus, Hippopotamus major,</i> and remains of the
genera bear, hy&aelig;na, and felis, nearly all of which occur in
the Cromer forest-bed (see Chap. 13, p. 191).</p>

<p>In the same upper strata are found, according to M. Gaudin, the
leaves and cones of <i>Glyptostrobus europ&aelig;us</i>, a plant
closely allied to <i>G. heterophyllus</i>, now inhabiting the north
of China and Japan. This conifer had a wide range in time, having
been traced back to the Lower Miocene strata of Switzerland, and
being common at &OElig;ningen in the Upper Miocene, as we shall see
in the sequel <a href="ch14.html#page 218">(p. 218).</a></p>

<p><b>Older Pliocene of Italy.&mdash;Subapennine
Strata.</b>&mdash;The Apennines, it is well-known, are composed
chiefly of Secondary or Mesozoic rocks, forming a chain which
branches off from the Ligurian Alps and passes down the middle of
the Italian peninsula. At the foot of these mountains, on the side
both of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, are found a series of
tertiary strata, which form, for the most part, a line of low hills
occupying the space between the older chain and the sea. Brocchi
was the first Italian geologist who described this newer group in
detail, giving it the name of the Subapennine. Though chiefly
composed of Older Pliocene strata, it belongs, nevertheless, in
part, both to older and newer members of the tertiary series. The
strata, for example, of the Superga, near Turin, are Miocene; those
of Asti and Parma Older Pliocene, as is the blue marl of Sienna;
while the shells of the incumbent yellow sand of the same territory
approach more nearly to the recent fauna of the Mediterranean, and
may be Newer Pliocene.</p>

<p>We have seen that most of the fossil shells of the Older
Pliocene strata of Suffolk which are of recent species are
identical with testacea now living in British seas, yet some of
them belong to Mediterranean species, and a few even of the genera
are those of warmer climates. We might therefore expect, in
studying the fossils of corresponding age in countries bordering
the Mediterranean, to find among them some species and genera of
warmer latitudes. Accordingly, in the marls belonging to this
period at Asti, Parma, Sienna, and parts of the Tuscan and Roman
territories, we observe the genera <i>Conus, Cypr&aelig;a,
Strombus, Pyrula, Mitra, Fasciolaria, Sigaretus, Delphinula,
Ancillaria, Oliva, Terebellum, Terebra, Perna, Plicatula,</i> and
<i>Corbis</i>, some characteristic of tropical seas, others
represented by species more numerous or of larger size than those
now proper to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><b>Older Pliocene Flora of Italy.</b>&mdash;I have already
alluded to the Newer Pliocene deposits of the Upper Val d&rsquo;Arno
above</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 209">[ 209 ]</a></p>

<p>Florence, and stated that below those sands and conglomerates,
containing the remains of the <i>Elephas meridionalis</i> and other
associated quadrupeds, lie an older horizontal and conformable
series of beds, which may be classed as Older Pliocene. They
consist of blue clays with some subordinate layers of lignite, and
exhibit a richer flora than the overlying Newer Pliocene beds, and
one receding farther from the existing vegetation of Europe. They
also comprise more species common to the antecedent Miocene period.
Among the genera of flowering plants, M. Gaudin enumerates pine,
oak, evergreen oak, plum, plane, alder, elm, fig, laurel, maple,
walnut, birch, buckthorn, hickory, sumach, sarsaparilla, sassafras,
cinnamon, Glyptostrobus, Taxodium, Sequoia, Persea, Oreodaphne
(Fig. 134), Cassia, and Psoralea, and some others. This assemblage
of plants indicates a warm climate, but not so subtropical an one
as that of the Upper Miocene period, which will presently be
considered.</p>

<p>M. Gaudin, jointly with the Marquis Strozzi, has thrown much
light on the botany of beds of the same age in another part of
Tuscany, at a place called Montajone, between the rivers Elsa and
Evola, where, among other plants, is found the <i>Oreodaphne
Heerii</i>, Gaud. (see Fig. 134), which is probably only a variety
of <i>Oreodaphne foetens</i>, or the laurel called</p>

climate of Europe. In the fossil specimens the same glands or
protuberances are preserved* (see Fig. 134) as those which are seen
in the axils of the primary veins of the leaves in the recent Til.
Another plant also indicating a warmer climate is the <i>
Liquidambar europ&aelig;um</i>, Brong. (see Fig. 135), a species
nearly allied to <i>L. styracifluum</i>, L., which flourishes in
most places in the Southern States of North America, on the borders
of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
