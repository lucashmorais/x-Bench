<p>Of what materials is the earth composed, and in what manner are
these materials arranged? These are the first inquiries with which
Geology is occupied, a science which derives its name from the
Greek <i>ge</i>, the earth, and <i>logos</i>, a discourse.
Previously to experience we might have imagined that investigations
of this kind would relate exclusively to the mineral kingdom, and
to the various rocks, soils, and metals, which occur upon the
surface of the earth, or at various depths beneath it. But, in
pursuing such researches, we soon find ourselves led on to consider
the successive changes which have taken place in the former state
of the earth&rsquo;s surface and interior, and the causes which have
given rise to these changes; and, what is still more singular and
unexpected, we soon become engaged in researches into the history
of the animate creation, or of the various tribes of animals and
plants which have, at different periods of the past, inhabited the
globe.</p>

<p>All are aware that the solid parts of the earth consist of
distinct substances, such as clay, chalk, sand, limestone, coal,
slate, granite, and the like; but previously to observation it is
commonly imagined that all these had remained from the first in the
state in which we now see them&mdash;that they were created in
their present form, and in their present position. The geologist
soon comes to a different conclusion, discovering</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 26">[ 26 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>proofs that the external parts of the earth were not all
produced in the beginning of things in the state in which we now
behold them, nor in an instant of time. On the contrary, he can
show that they have acquired their actual configuration and
condition gradually, under a great variety of circumstances, and at
successive periods, during each of which distinct races of living
beings have flourished on the land and in the waters, the remains
of these creatures still lying buried in the crust of the
earth.</p>

<p>By the &ldquo;earth&rsquo;s crust,&rdquo;  is meant that small portion of the
exterior of our planet which is accessible to human observation. It
comprises not merely all of which the structure is laid open in
mountain precipices, or in cliffs overhanging a river or the sea,
or whatever the miner may reveal in artificial excavations; but the
whole of that outer covering of the planet on which we are enabled
to reason by observations made at or near the surface. These
reasonings may extend to a depth of several miles, perhaps ten
miles; and even then it may be said, that such a thickness is no
more than 1/400 part of the distance from the surface to the
centre. The remark is just: but although the dimensions of such a
crust are, in truth, insignificant when compared to the entire
globe, yet they are vast, and of magnificent extent in relation to
man, and to the organic beings which people our globe. Referring to
this standard of magnitude, the geologist may admire the ample
limits of his domain, and admit, at the same time, that not only
the exterior of the planet, but the entire earth, is but an atom in
the midst of the countless worlds surveyed by the astronomer.</p>

<p>The materials of this crust are not thrown together confusedly;
but distinct mineral masses, called rocks, are found to occupy
definite spaces, and to exhibit a certain order of arrangement. The
term <i>rock</i> is applied indifferently by geologists to all
these substances, whether they be soft or stony, for clay and sand
are included in the term, and some have even brought peat under
this denomination. Our old writers endeavoured to avoid offering
such violence to our language, by speaking of the component
materials of the earth as consisting of rocks and <i>soils.</i> But
there is often so insensible a passage from a soft and incoherent
state to that of stone, that geologists of all countries have found
it indispensable to have one technical term to include both, and in
this sense we find <i>roche</i> applied in French, <i>rocca</i> in
Italian, and <i>felsart</i> in German. The beginner, however, must
constantly bear in mind that the term rock by no means implies that
a mineral mass is in an indurated or stony condition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 27">[ 27 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>The most natural and convenient mode of classifying the various
rocks which compose the earth&rsquo;s crust, is to refer, in the first
place, to their origin, and in the second to their relative age. I
shall therefore begin by endeavouring briefly to explain to the
student how all rocks may be divided into four great classes by
reference to their different origin, or, in other words, by
reference to the different circumstances and causes by which they
have been produced.</p>

<p>The first two divisions, which will at once be understood as
natural, are the aqueous and volcanic, or the products of watery
and those of igneous action at or near the surface.</p>

<p><b>Aqueous Rocks.</b>&mdash;The aqueous rocks, sometimes called
the sedimentary, or fossiliferous, cover a larger part of the
earth&rsquo;s surface than any others. They consist chiefly of mechanical
deposits (pebbles, sand, and mud), but are partly of chemical and
some of them of organic origin, especially the limestones. These
rocks are <i>stratified,</i> or divided into distinct layers, or
strata. The term <i>stratum</i> means simply a bed, or any thing
spread out or <i>strewed</i> over a given surface; and we infer
that these strata have been generally spread out by the action of
water, from what we daily see taking place near the mouths of
rivers, or on the land during temporary inundations. For, whenever
a running stream charged with mud or sand, has its velocity
checked, as when it enters a lake or sea, or overflows a plain, the
sediment, previously held in suspension by the motion of the water,
sinks, by its own gravity to the bottom. In this manner layers of
mud and sand are thrown down one upon another.</p>

<p>If we drain a lake which has been fed by a small stream, we
frequently find at the bottom a series of deposits, disposed with
considerable regularity, one above the other; the uppermost,
perhaps, may be a stratum of peat, next below a more dense and
solid variety of the same material; still lower a bed of
shell-marl, alternating with peat or sand, and then other beds of
marl, divided by layers of clay. Now, if a second pit be sunk
through the same continuous lacustrine <i>formation</i> at some
distance from the first, nearly the same series of beds is commonly
met with, yet with slight variations; some, for example, of the
layers of sand, clay, or marl, may be wanting, one or more of them
having thinned out and given place to others, or sometimes one of
the masses first examined is observed to increase in thickness to
the exclusion of other beds.</p>

<p>The term <i>formation,</i> which I have used in the above
explanation, expresses in geology any assemblage of rocks which
have some character in common, whether of origin,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 28">[ 28 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>age, or composition. Thus we speak of stratified and
unstratified, fresh-water and marine, aqueous and volcanic, ancient
and modern, metalliferous and non-metalliferous formations.</p>

<p>In the estuaries of large rivers, such as the Ganges and the
Mississippi, we may observe, at low water, phenomena analogous to
those of the drained lakes above mentioned, but on a grander scale,
and extending over areas several hundred miles in length and
breadth. When the periodical inundations subside, the river hollows
out a channel to the depth of many yards through horizontal beds of
clay and sand, the ends of which are seen exposed in perpendicular
cliffs. These beds vary in their mineral composition, or colour, or
in the fineness or coarseness of their particles, and some of them
are occasionally characterised by containing drift-wood. At the
junction of the river and the sea, especially in lagoons nearly
separated by sand-bars from the ocean, deposits are often formed in
which brackish and salt-water shells are included.</p>

<p>In Egypt, where the Nile is always adding to its delta by
filling up part of the Mediterranean with mud, the newly deposited
sediment is <i>stratified,</i> the thin layer thrown down in one
season differing slightly in colour from that of a previous year,
and being separable from it, as has been observed in excavations at
Cairo and other places.*</p>

<p>When beds of sand, clay, and marl, containing shells and
vegetable matter, are found arranged in a similar manner in the
interior of the earth, we ascribe to them a similar origin; and the
more we examine their characters in minute detail, the more exact
do we find the resemblance. Thus, for example, at various heights
and depths in the earth, and often far from seas, lakes, and
rivers, we meet with layers of rounded pebbles composed of flint,
limestone, granite, or other rocks, resembling the shingles of a
sea-beach or the gravel in a torrent&rsquo;s bed. Such layers of pebbles
frequently alternate with others formed of sand or fine sediment,
just as we may see in the channel of a river descending from hills
bordering a coast, where the current sweeps down at one season
coarse sand and gravel, while at another, when the waters are low
and less rapid, fine mud and sand alone are carried
seaward.&dagger;</p>

<p>If a stratified arrangement, and the rounded form of pebbles,
are alone sufficient to lead us to the conclusion that certain
rocks originated under water, this opinion is farther confirmed by
the distinct and independent evidence of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 29">[ 29 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p><i>fossils,</i> so abundantly included in the earth&rsquo;s crust. By
a <i>fossil</i> is meant any body, or the traces of the existence
of any body, whether animal or vegetable, which has been buried in
the earth by natural causes. Now the remains of animals, especially
of aquatic species, are found almost everywhere imbedded in
stratified rocks, and sometimes, in the case of limestone, they are
in such abundance as to constitute the entire mass of the rock
itself. Shells and corals are the most frequent, and with them are
often associated the bones and teeth of fishes, fragments of wood,
impressions of leaves, and other organic substances. Fossil shells,
of forms such as now abound in the sea, are met with far inland,
both near the surface, and at great depths below it. They occur at
all heights above the level of the ocean, having been observed at
elevations of more than 8000 feet in the Pyrenees, 10,000 in the
Alps, 13,000 in the Andes, and above 18,000 feet in the
Himalaya.*</p>

<p>These shells belong mostly to marine testacea, but in some
places exclusively to forms characteristic of lakes and rivers.
Hence it is concluded that some ancient strata were deposited at
the bottom of the sea, and others in lakes and estuaries.</p>

<p>We have now pointed out one great class of rocks, which, however
they may vary in mineral composition, colour, grain, or other
characters, external and internal, may nevertheless be grouped
together as having a common origin. They have all been formed under
water, in the same manner as modern accumulations of sand, mud,
shingle, banks of shells, reefs of coral, and the like, and are all
characterised by stratification or fossils, or by both.</p>

<p><b>Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The division of rocks which we may
next consider are the volcanic, or those which have been produced
at or near the surface whether in ancient or modern times, not by
water, but by the action of fire or subterranean heat. These rocks
are for the most part unstratified, and are devoid of fossils. They
are more partially distributed than aqueous formations, at least in
respect to horizontal extension. Among those parts of Europe where
they exhibit characters not to be mistaken, I may mention not only
Sicily and the country round Naples, but Auvergne, Velay, and
Vivarais, now the departments of Puy de Dome, Haute Loire, and
Ard&ecirc;che, towards the centre and south of France, in which are
several hundred conical hills having the forms of modern volcanoes,
with craters more or less perfect on many of their summits. These
cones are composed moreover</p>

<p class="fnote">* Col. R. J. Strachey found oolitic fossils 18,400
feet high in the Himalaya.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 30">[ 30 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>of lava, sand, and ashes, similar to those of active volcanoes.
Streams of lava may sometimes be traced from the cones into the
adjoining valleys, where they have choked up the ancient channels
of rivers with solid rock, in the same manner as some modern flows
of lava in Iceland have been known to do, the rivers either flowing
beneath or cutting out a narrow passage on one side of the lava.
Although none of these French volcanoes have been in activity
within the period of history or tradition, their forms are often
very perfect. Some, however, have been compared to the mere
skeletons of volcanoes, the rains and torrents having washed their
sides, and removed all the loose sand and scori&aelig;, leaving
only the harder and more solid materials. By this erosion, and by
earthquakes, their internal structure has occasionally been laid
open to view, in fissures and ravines; and we then behold not only
many successive beds and masses of porous lava, sand, and
scori&aelig;, but also perpendicular walls, or <i>dikes,</i> as
they are called, of volcanic rock, which have burst through the
other materials. Such dikes are also observed in the structure of
Vesuvius, Etna, and other active volcanoes. They have been formed
by the pouring of melted matter, whether from above or below, into
open fissures, and they commonly traverse deposits of <i>volcanic
tuff,</i> a substance produced by the showering down from the air,
or incumbent waters, of sand and cinders, first shot up from the
interior of the earth by the explosions of volcanic gases.</p>

<p>Besides the parts of France above alluded to, there are other
countries, as the north of Spain, the south of Sicily, the Tuscan
territory of Italy, the lower Rhenish provinces, and Hungary, where
spent volcanoes may be seen, still preserving in many cases a
conical form, and having craters and often lava-streams connected
with them.</p>

<p>There are also other rocks in England, Scotland, Ireland, and
almost every country in Europe, which we infer to be of igneous
origin, although they do not form hills with cones and craters.
Thus, for example, we feel assured that the rock of Staffa, and
that of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, called basalt, is volcanic, because
it agrees in its columnar structure and mineral composition with
streams of lava which we know to have flowed from the craters of
volcanoes. We find also similar basaltic and other igneous rocks
associated with beds of <i>tuff</i> in various parts of the British
Isles, and forming <i>dikes,</i> such as have been spoken of; and
some of the strata through which these dikes cut are occasionally
altered at the point of contact, as if they had been exposed to the
intense heat of melted matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 31">[ 31 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>The absence of cones and craters, and long narrow streams of
superficial lava, in England and many other countries, is
principally to be attributed to the eruptions having been
submarine, just as a considerable proportion of volcanoes in our
own times burst out beneath the sea. But this question must be
enlarged upon more fully in the chapters on Igneous Rocks, in which
it will also be shown, that as different sedimentary formations,
containing each their characteristic fossils, have been deposited
at successive periods, so also volcanic sand and scori&aelig; have
been thrown out, and lavas have flowed over the land or bed of the
sea, at many different epochs, or have been injected into fissures;
so that the igneous as well as the aqueous rocks may be classed as
a chronological series of monuments, throwing light on a succession
of events in the history of the earth.</p>

<p><b>Plutonic Rocks</b> (<i>Granite,</i> etc).&mdash;We have now
pointed out the existence of two distinct orders of mineral masses,
the aqueous and the volcanic: but if we examine a large portion of
a continent, especially if it contain within it a lofty mountain
range, we rarely fail to discover two other classes of rocks, very
distinct from either of those above alluded to, and which we can
neither assimilate to deposits such as are now accumulated in lakes
or seas, nor to those generated by ordinary volcanic action. The
members of both these divisions of rocks agree in being highly
crystalline and destitute of organic remains. The rocks of one
division have been called Plutonic, comprehending all the granites
and certain porphyries, which are nearly allied in some of their
characters to volcanic formations. The members of the other class
are stratified and often slaty, and have been called by some the
<i>crystalline schists,</i> in which group are included gneiss,
micaceous-schist (or mica-slate), hornblende-schist, statuary
marble, the finer kinds of roofing slate, and other rocks
afterwards to be described.</p>

<p>As it is admitted that nothing strictly analogous to these
crystalline productions can now be seen in the progress of
formation on the earth&rsquo;s surface, it will naturally be asked, on
what data we can find a place for them in a system of
classification founded on the origin of rocks. I can not, in reply
to this question, pretend to give the student, in a few words, an
intelligible account of the long chain of facts and reasonings from
which geologists have been led to infer the nature of the rocks in
question. The result, however, may be briefly stated. All the
various kinds of granites which constitute the Plutonic family are
supposed to be of igneous or aqueo-igneous origin, and to have been
formed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 32">[ 32 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>under great pressure, at a considerable depth in the earth, or
sometimes, perhaps, under a certain weight of incumbent ocean. Like
the lava of volcanoes, they have been melted, and afterwards cooled
and crystallised, but with extreme slowness, and under conditions
very different from those of bodies cooling in the open air. Hence
they differ from the volcanic rocks, not only by their more
crystalline texture, but also by the absence of tuffs and breccias,
which are the products of eruptions at the earth&rsquo;s surface, or
beneath seas of inconsiderable depth. They differ also by the
absence of pores or cellular cavities, to which the expansion of
the entangled gases gives rise in ordinary lava.</p>

<p><b>Metamorphic, or Stratified Crystalline Rocks.</b>&mdash;The
fourth and last great division of rocks are the crystalline strata
and slates, or schists, called gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate,
chlorite-schist, marble, and the like, the origin of which is more
doubtful than that of the other three classes. They contain no
pebbles, or sand, or scori&aelig;, or angular pieces of imbedded
stone, and no traces of organic bodies, and they are often as
crystalline as granite, yet are divided into beds, corresponding in
form and arrangement to those of sedimentary formations, and are
therefore said to be stratified. The beds sometimes consist of an
alternation of substances varying in colour, composition, and
thickness, precisely as we see in stratified fossiliferous
deposits. According to the Huttonian theory, which I adopt as the
most probable, and which will be afterwards more fully explained,
the materials of these strata were originally deposited from water
in the usual form of sediment, but they were subsequently so
altered by subterranean heat, as to assume a new texture. It is
demonstrable, in some cases at least, that such a complete
conversion has actually taken place, fossiliferous strata having
exchanged an earthy for a highly crystalline texture for a distance
of a quarter of a mile from their contact with granite. In some
cases, dark limestones, replete with shells and corals, have been
turned into white statuary marble; and hard clays, containing
vegetable or other remains, into slates called mica-schist or
hornblende-schist, every vestige of the organic bodies having been
obliterated.</p>

<p>Although we are in a great degree ignorant of the precise nature
of the influence exerted in these cases, yet it evidently bears
some analogy to that which volcanic heat and gases are known to
produce; and the action may be conveniently called Plutonic,
because it appears to have been developed in those regions where
Plutonic rocks are generated, and under similar circumstances of
pressure and depth in the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 33">[ 33 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>earth. Intensely heated water or steam permeating stratified
masses under great pressure have no doubt played their part in
producing the crystalline texture and other changes, and it is
clear that the transforming influence has often pervaded entire
mountain masses of strata.</p>

<p>In accordance with the hypothesis above alluded to, I proposed
in the first edition of the Principles of Geology (1833) the term
&ldquo;Metamorphic&rdquo;  for the altered strata, a term derived from meta, <i>
trans,</i> and morphe, <i>forma.</i></p>

<p>Hence there are four great classes of rocks considered in
reference to their origin&mdash;the aqueous, the volcanic, the
Plutonic, and the metamorphic. In the course of this work it will
be shown that portions of each of these four distinct classes have
originated at many successive periods. They have all been produced
contemporaneously, and may even now be in the progress of formation
on a large scale. It is not true, as was formerly supposed, that
all granites, together with the crystalline or metamorphic strata,
were first formed, and therefore entitled to be called &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo;
and that the aqueous and volcanic rocks were afterwards
superimposed, and should, therefore, rank as secondary in the order
of time. This idea was adopted in the infancy of the science, when
all formations, whether stratified or unstratified, earthy or
crystalline, with or without fossils, were alike regarded as of
aqueous origin. At that period it was naturally argued that the
foundation must be older than the superstructure; but it was
afterwards discovered that this opinion was by no means in every
instance a legitimate deduction from facts; for the inferior parts
of the earth&rsquo;s crust have often been modified, and even entirely
changed, by the influence of volcanic and other subterranean
causes, while superimposed formations have not been in the
slightest degree altered. In other words, the destroying and
renovating processes have given birth to new rocks below, while
those above, whether crystalline or fossiliferous, have remained in
their ancient condition. Even in cities, such as Venice and
Amsterdam, it cannot be laid down as universally true that the
upper parts of each edifice, whether of brick or marble, are more
modern than the foundations on which they rest, for these often
consist of wooden piles, which may have rotted and been replaced
one after the other, without the least injury to the buildings
above; meanwhile, these may have required scarcely any repair, and
may have been constantly inhabited. So it is with the habitable
surface of our globe, in its relation to large masses of rock
immediately below; it may continue the same for ages, while
subjacent materials, at</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 34">[ 34 ]</a></p>

<br>
 

<p>a great depth, are passing from a solid to a fluid state, and
then reconsolidating, so as to acquire a new texture.</p>

<p>As all the crystalline rocks may, in some respects, be viewed as
belonging to one great family, whether they be stratified or
unstratified, metamorphic or Plutonic, it will often be convenient
to speak of them by one common name. It being now ascertained, as
above stated, that they are of very different ages, sometimes newer
than the strata called secondary, the terms primitive and primary
which were formerly used for the whole must be abandoned, as they
would imply a manifest contradiction. It is indispensable,
therefore, to find a new name, one which must not be of
chronological import, and must express, on the one hand, some
peculiarity equally attributable to granite and gneiss (to the
Plutonic as well as the <i>altered</i> rocks), and, on the other,
must have reference to characters in which those rocks differ, both
from the volcanic and from the <i>unaltered</i> sedimentary strata.
I proposed in the Principles of Geology (first edition, vol. iii)
the term &ldquo;hypogene&rdquo;  for this purpose, derived from upo, <i>
under,</i> and ginomai, <i>to be,</i> or <i>to be born</i>; a word
implying the theory that granite, gneiss, and the other crystalline
formations are alike <i>netherformed</i> rocks, or rocks which have
not assumed their present form and structure at the surface. They
occupy the lowest place in the order of superposition. Even in
regions such as the Alps, where some masses of granite and gneiss
can be shown to be of comparatively modern date, belonging, for
example, to the period hereafter to be described as tertiary, they
are still <i>underlying</i> rocks. They never repose on the
volcanic or trappean formations, nor on strata containing organic
remains. They are <i>hypogene,</i> as &ldquo;being under&rdquo;  all the
rest.</p>

<p>From what has now been said, the reader will understand that
each of the four great classes of rocks may be studied under two
distinct points of view; first, they may be studied simply as
mineral masses deriving their origin from particular causes, and
having a certain composition, form, and position in the earth&rsquo;s
crust, or other characters both positive and negative, such as the
presence or absence of organic remains. In the second place, the
rocks of each class may be viewed as a grand chronological series
of monuments, attesting a succession of events in the former
history of the globe and its living inhabitants.</p>

<p>I shall accordingly proceed to treat of each family of rocks;
first, in reference to those characters which are not
chronological, and then in particular relation to the several
periods when they were formed.</p>
