&mdash; The origin of the Oolite and Lias, and of alternating
Calcareous and Argillaceous Formations.</p>

<p><b>Lias.</b>&mdash;The English provincial name of Lias has been
very generally adopted for a formation of argillaceous limestone,
marl, and clay, which forms the base of the Oolite, and is classed
by many geologists as part of that group. The peculiar aspect which
is most characteristic of the Lias in England, France, and Germany,
is an alternation of thin beds of blue or grey limestone, having a
surface which becomes light-brown when weathered, these beds being
separated by dark-coloured, narrow argillaceous partings, so that
the quarries of this rock, at a distance, assume a striped and
ribbon-like appearance.</p>

<p>The Lias has been divided in England into three groups, the
Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Upper Lias consists first of sands,
which were formerly regarded as the base of the Oolite, but which,
according to Dr. Wright, are by their fossils more properly
referable to the Lias; secondly, of clay shale and thin beds of
limestone. The Middle Lias, or marl-stone series, has been divided
into three zones; and the Lower Lias, according to the labours of
Quenstedt, Oppel, Strickland, Wright, and others, into seven zones,
each marked by its own group of fossils. This Lower Lias averages
from 600 to 900 feet in thickness.</p>

<p>From Devon and Dorsetshire to Yorkshire all these divisions,
observes Professor Ramsay, are constant; and from top to bottom we
can not assert that anywhere there is actual unconformity between
any two subdivisions, whether of the larger or smaller kind.</p>

<p>In the whole of the English Lias there are at present known
about 937 species of mollusca, and of these 267 are Cephalopods, of
which class more than two-thirds are Ammonites,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 354">[ 354 ]</a></p>

<p>the Nautilus and Belemnite also abounding. The whole series has
been divided by zones characterised by particular Ammonites; for
while other families of shells pass from one division to another in
numbers varying from about 20 to 50 per cent, these cephalopods are
almost always limited to single zones, as Quenstedt and Oppel have
shown for Germany, and Dr. Wright and others for England.</p>

<p>As no actual unconformity is known from the top of the Upper to
the bottom of the Lower Lias, and as there is a marked uniformity
in the mineral character of almost all the strata, it is somewhat
difficult to account even for such partial breaks as have been
alluded to in the succession of species, if we reject the
hypothesis that the old species were in each case destroyed at the
close of the deposition of the rocks containing them, and replaced
by the creation of new forms when the succeeding formation began. I
agree with Professor Ramsay in not accepting this hypothesis. No
doubt some of the old species occasionally died out, and left no
representatives in Europe or elsewhere; others were locally
exterminated in the struggle for life by species which invaded
their ancient domain, or by varieties better fitted for a new state
of things. Pauses also of vast duration may have occurred in the
deposition of strata, allowing time for the modification of organic
life throughout the globe, slowly brought about by variation
accompanied by extinction of the original forms.</p>

<p><b>Fossils of the Lias.</b>&mdash;The name of Gryphite limestone
has sometimes been applied to the Lias, in consequence of the great
number of shells which it contains of a species of oyster, or <i>
Gryph&aelig;a</i> (Fig. 362). A large heavy shell called</p>

<p><i>Hippopodium</i> (Fig. 365), allied to <i>Cypricardia,</i> is
also characteristic of the upper part of the Lower Lias. In this
formation occur also the Aviculas, Figs. 363 and 364. The Lias
formation is also remarkable for being the newest of the secondary
rocks in which brachiopoda of the genera <i>Spirifer</i> and <i>
Lept&aelig;na</i> (Figs. 366, 367) occur, although the former is
slightly modified in structure so as to constitute the subgenus
Spiriferina, Davidson, and the Lept&aelig;na has dwindled to a
shell smaller in size than a pea. No less than eight or nine
species of Spiriferina are enumerated by Mr. Davidson as belonging
to the Lias. Palliobranchiate mollusca predominate greatly in</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made, p. 354, to numerous zones in the
Lias having each their peculiar Ammonites. Two of these occur near
the base of the Lower Lias, having a united thickness, varying from
40 to 80 feet. The upper of these is characterised by <i>Ammonites
Bucklandi,</i> and the lower by <i>Ammonites planorbis</i> (see
Figs. 368, 369).* Sometimes, however, there is a third intermediate
zone, that of <i>Ammonites angulatus,</i> which is the equivalent
of the zone called the infra-lias on the Continent, the species of

<p>Among the Crinoids or Stone-lilies of the Lias, the
Pentacrinites are conspicuous. (See Fig. 373.) Of <i>
Pal&aelig;ocoma (Ophioderma) Egertoni</i> (Fig. 374), referable to
the <i>Ophiurid&aelig;</i> of Muller, perfect specimens have been
met with in the Middle Lias beds of Dorset and Yorkshire.</p>

</center>

<p>The <i>Extracrinus Briareus</i> (removed by Major Austin from
Pentacrinus on account of generic differences) occurs in tangled
masses, forming thin beds of considerable extent, in the Lower Lias
of Dorset, Gloucestershire, and Yorkshire. The remains are often
highly charged with pyrites. This Crinoid, with its innumerable
tentacular arms, appears to have been frequently attached to the
driftwood of the liassic sea, in the same manner as Barnacles float
about on wood at the present day. There is another species of <i>
Extracrinus</i> and several of</p>

<p><i>Pentacrinus</i> in the Lias; and the latter genus is found in
nearly all the formations from the Lias to the London Clay
inclusive. It is represented in the present seas by the delicate
and rare <i>Pentacrinus caput-medus&aelig;</i> of the Antilles,
which, with Comatula, is one of the few surviving members of the
ancient family of the Crinoids, represented by so many extinct
genera in the older formations.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Fishes of the Lias.</b>&mdash;The fossil fish, of which there
are no less than 117 species known as British, resemble generically
those of the Oolite, but differ, according to M. Agassiz, from
those of the Cretaceous period. Among them is a species of <i>
Lepidotus</i> (<i>L. gigas,</i> Agassiz), Fig. 375, which is found
in the Lias of England, France, and Germany.* This genus was before
mentioned (<a href="ch18.html#page 316">p. 316</a>) as occurring in
the Wealden, and is supposed to have frequented both rivers and
sea-coasts. Another genus of Ganoids (or fish with hard, shining,
and enamelled scales), called <i>&AElig;chmodus</i> (Fig. 376), is
almost exclusively Liassic. The teeth of a species of <i>
Acrodus,</i> also, are very abundant in the Lias (Fig. 377).</p>

</center>

<p>But the remains of fish which have excited more attention than
any others are those large bony spines called ichthyodorulites (a,
Figure 378), which were once supposed by some naturalists to be
jaws, and by others weapons, resembling those of the living
Balistes and Silurus; but which M. Agassiz has shown to be neither
the one nor the other. The spines, in the genera last mentioned,
articulate with the backbone, whereas there are no signs of any
such articulation in the ichthyodorulites.</p>

<img src="images3/fig379.jpg" width="248" height="175" alt=
"Fig. 379: Chim&aelig;ra monstrosa.*" align="right"> 

<p>These last appear to have been bony spines which formed the
anterior part of the dorsal fin, like that of the living genera <i>
Cestracion</i> and <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> (see <i>a,</i> Figure 379).
In both of these genera, the posterior concave face is armed with
small spines, as in that of the fossil <i>Hybodus</i> (Fig. 378), a
placoid fish of the shark family found fossil at Lyme Regis. Such
spines are simply imbedded in the flesh, and attached to strong
muscles. &ldquo;They serve,&rdquo; says Dr. Buckland, &ldquo;as in
the <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> (Fig. 379), to raise and depress the fin,

<p>resembling that of a movable mast, raising and lowering backward
the sail of a barge.&rdquo;*</p>

<p><b>Reptiles of the Lias.</b>&mdash;It is not, however, the
fossil fish which form the most striking feature in the organic
remains of the Lias; but the <i>Enaliosaurian</i> reptiles, which
are extraordinary for their number, size, and structure. Among the
most singular of these are several species of <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>
and <i>Plesiosaurus</i> (Figs. 380, 381). The genus <i>
Ichthyosaurus,</i> or fish-lizard, is not confined to this
formation, but has been found in strata as high as the White Chalk
of England, and as low as the Trias of Germany, a formation which
immediately succeeds the Lias in the descending order. It is
evident from their fish-like vertebr&aelig;, their paddles,
resembling those of a porpoise or whale, the length of their tail,
and other parts of their structure, that the Ichthyosaurs were
aquatic. Their jaws and teeth show that they were carnivorous; and
the half-digested remains of fishes and reptiles, found within
their skeletons, indicate the precise nature of their food.</p>

<p>Mr. Conybeare was enabled, in 1824, after examining many
skeletons nearly perfect, to give an ideal restoration of the
osteology of this genus, and of that of the <i>
Plesiosaurus.</i>&dagger; (See Figs. 380, 381.) The latter animal
had an extremely long neck and small head, with teeth like those of
the crocodile, and paddles analogous to those of the <i>
Ichthyosaurus,</i> but larger. It is supposed to have lived in
shallow seas and estuaries, and to have breathed air like the
Ichthyosaur and our modern cetacea.&Dagger; Some of the reptiles
above mentioned were of formidable dimensions. One specimen of <i>
Ichthyosaurus platydon,</i> from the Lias at Lyme, now in the
British Museum, must have belonged to an animal more than 24 feet
in length; and there are species of <i>Plesiosaurus</i> which
measure from 18 to 20 feet in length. The form of the <i>
Ichthyosaurus</i> may have fitted it to cut through the waves like
the porpoise; as it was furnished besides its paddles with a
tail-fin so constructed as to be a powerful organ of motion; but it
is supposed that the <i>Plesiosaurus,</i> at least the long-necked
species (Fig. 381), was better suited to fish in shallow creeks and
bays defended from heavy breakers.</p>

<p>It is now very generally agreed that these extinct saurians must
have inhabited the sea; and it was urged that as there are now
chelonians, like the tortoise, living in fresh water,</p>

<p>and others, as the turtle, frequenting the ocean, so there may
have been formerly some saurians proper to salt, others to fresh
water. The common crocodile of the Ganges is well-known to frequent
equally that river and the brackish and salt water near its mouth;
and crocodiles are said in like manner to be abundant both in the
rivers of the Isla de</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 362">[ 362 ]</a></p>

<p>Pinos (Isle of Pines), south of Cuba, and in the open sea round
the coast. In 1835 a curious lizard (<i>Amblyrhynchus
cristatus</i>) was discovered by Mr. Darwin in the Galapagos
Islands.* It was found to be exclusively marine, swimming easily by
means of its flattened tail, and subsisting chiefly on seaweed. One
of them was sunk from the ship by a heavy weight, and on being
drawn up after an hour was quite unharmed.</p>

<p>The families of Dinosauria, crocodiles, and Pterosauria or
winged reptiles, are also represented in the Lias.</p>

<p><b>Sudden Destruction of Saurians.</b>&mdash;It has been
remarked, and truly, that many of the fish and saurians, found
fossil in the Lias, must have met with sudden death and immediate
burial; and that the destructive operation, whatever may have been
its nature, was often repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; says Dr. Buckland, &ldquo;scarcely a
single bone or scale has been removed from the place it occupied
during life; which could not have happened had the uncovered bodies
of these saurians been left, even for a few hours, exposed to
putrefaction, and to the attacks of fishes and other smaller
animals at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;&dagger; Not only are the
skeletons of the Ichthyosaurs entire, but sometimes the contents of
their stomachs still remain between their ribs, as before remarked,
so that we can discover the particular species of fish on which
they lived, and the form of their excrements. Not unfrequently
there are layers of these coprolites, at different depths in the
Lias, at a distance from any entire skeletons of the marine lizards
from which they were derived; &ldquo;as if,&rdquo; says Sir H. De
la Beche, &ldquo;the muddy bottom of the sea received small sudden
accessions of matter from time to time, covering up the coprolites
and other exuvi&aelig; which had accumulated during the
intervals.&rdquo;&Dagger; It is further stated that, at Lyme Regis,
those surfaces only of the coprolites which lay uppermost at the
bottom of the sea have suffered partial decay, from the action of
water before they were covered and protected by the muddy sediment
that has afterwards permanently enveloped them.</p>

<p>Numerous specimens of the Calamary or pen-and-ink fish,
(<i>Geoteuthis bollensis</i>) have also been met with in the Lias
at Lyme, with the ink-bags still distended, containing the ink in a
dried state, chiefly composed of carbon, and but slightly
impregnated with carbonate of lime. These Cephalopoda, therefore,
must, like the saurians, have been soon buried in</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 363">[ 363 ]</a></p>

<p>sediment; for, if long exposed after death, the membrane
containing the ink would have decayed.*</p>

<p>As we know that river-fish are sometimes stifled, even in their
own element, by muddy water during floods, it can not be doubted
that the periodical discharge of large bodies of turbid fresh water
in the sea may be still more fatal to marine tribes. In the
&ldquo;Principles of Geology&rdquo; I have shown that large
quantities of mud and drowned animals have been swept down into the
sea by rivers during earthquakes, as in Java in 1699; and that
indescribable multitudes of dead fishes have been seen floating on
the sea after a discharge of noxious vapours during similar
convulsions. But in the intervals between such catastrophes, strata
may have accumulated slowly in the sea of the Lias, some being
formed chiefly of one description of shell, such as ammonites,
others of gryphites.</p>

<p><b>Fresh-water Deposits.&mdash;Insect-beds.</b>&mdash;From the
above remarks the reader will infer that the Lias is for the most
part a marine deposit. Some members, however, of the series have an
estuarine character, and must have been formed within the influence
of rivers. At the base of the Upper and Lower Lias respectively,
insect-beds appear to be almost everywhere present throughout the
Midland and South-western districts of England. These beds are
crowded with the remains of insects, small fish, and crustaceans,
with occasional marine shells. One band in Gloucestershire, rarely
exceeding a foot in thickness, has been named the &ldquo;insect
limestone.&rdquo; It passes upward, says the Reverend P. B.
Brodie,&dagger; into a shale containing <i>Cypris</i> and <i>
Estheria,</i> and is full of the wing-cases of several genera of
Coleoptera, with some nearly entire beetles, of which the eyes are
preserved. The nervures of the wings of neuropterous insects
(Figure 382) are beautifully perfect in this bed. Ferns, with
Cycads and leaves of monocotyledonous plants, and some apparently
brackish and fresh-water shells, accompany the insects in several
places, while in others marine shells predominate, the fossils
varying apparently as we examine the bed nearer or farther from the
ancient land, or the source whence the fresh water was derived.
After studying 300 specimens of these insects from the Lias, Mr.
Westwood declares that they comprise both</p>

<p>wood-eating and herb-devouring beetles, of the Linnean genera
<i>Elater, Carabus,</i> etc., besides grasshoppers
(<i>Gryllus</i>), and detached wings of dragon-flies and may-flies,
or insects referable to the Linnean genera <i>Libellula, Ephemera,
Hemerobius,</i> and <i>Panorpa,</i> in all belonging to no less
than twenty-four families. The size of the species is usually
small, and such as taken alone would imply a temperate climate; but
many of the associated organic remains of other classes must lead
to a different conclusion.</p>

<p><b>Fossil Plants.</b>&mdash;Among the vegetable remains of the
Lias, several species of <i>Zamia</i> have been found at Lyme
Regis, and the remains of coniferous plants at Whitby. M. Ad.
Brongniart enumerates forty-seven liassic acrogens, most of them
ferns; and fifty gymnosperms, of which thirty-nine are cycads, and
eleven conifers. Among the cycads the predominance of <i>
Zamites,</i> and among the ferns the numerous genera with leaves
having reticulated veins (as in <a href="images2/fig349.jpg">Fig.
349</a>), are mentioned as botanical characteristics of this era.*
The absence as yet from the Lias and Oolite of all signs of
dicotyledonous angiosperms is worthy of notice. The leaves of such
plants are frequent in tertiary strata, and occur in the
Cretaceous, though less plentifully (see <a href=
"ch17.html#page 303">p. 303</a>). The angiosperms seem, therefore,
to have been at the least comparatively rare in these older
secondary periods, when more space was occupied by the Cycads and
Conifers.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Oolite and Lias.</b>&mdash;The entire group of
Oolite and Lias consists of repeated alternations of clay,
sandstone, and limestone, following each other in the same order.
Thus the clays of the Lias are followed by the sands now considered
(see <a href="#page 353">p. 353</a>) as belonging to the same
formation, though formerly referred to the Inferior Oolite, and
these sands again by the shelly and coralline limestone called the
Great or Bath Oolite. So, in the Middle Oolite, the Oxford Clay is
followed by calcareous grit and coral rag; lastly, in the Upper
Oolite, the Kimmeridge Clay is followed by the Portland Sand and
limestone (see <a href="images2/fig298.jpg">Fig. 298</a>).&dagger;
The clay beds, however, as Sir H. de la Beche remarks, can be
followed over larger areas than the sand or sandstones.&Dagger; It
should also be remembered that while the Oolite system becomes
arenaceous and resembles a coal-field in Yorkshire, it assumes in
the Alps an almost purely calcareous form, the sands and clays
being omitted; and even in the intervening tracts it is more
complicated and variable than appears in ordinary descriptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 365">[ 365 ]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, some of the clays and intervening limestones do
retain, in reality, a pretty uniform character for distances of
from 400 to 600 miles from east to west and north to south.</p>

<p>In order to account for such a succession of events, we may
imagine, first, the bed of the ocean to be the receptacle for ages
of fine argillaceous sediment, brought by oceanic currents, which
may have communicated with rivers, or with part of the sea near a
wasting coast. This mud ceases, at length, to be conveyed to the
same region, either because the land which had previously suffered
denudation is depressed and submerged, or because the current is
deflected in another direction by the altered shape of the bed of
the ocean and neighbouring dry land. By such changes the water
becomes once more clear and fit for the growth of stony zoophytes.
Calcareous sand is then formed from comminuted shell and coral, or,
in some cases, arenaceous matter replaces the clay; because it
commonly happens that the finer sediment, being first drifted
farthest from coasts, is subsequently overspread by coarse sand,
after the sea has grown shallower, or when the land, increasing in
extent, whether by upheaval or by sediment filling up parts of the
sea, has approached nearer to the spots first occupied by fine
mud.</p>

<p>The increased thickness of the limestones in those regions, as
in the Alps and Jura, where the clays are comparatively thin,
arises from the calcareous matter having been derived from species
of corals and other organic beings which live in clear water, far
from land, to the growth of which the influx of mud would be
unfavourable. Portions therefore of these clays and limestones have
probably been formed contemporaneously to a greater extent than we
can generally prove, for the distinctness of the species of organic
beings would be caused by the difference of conditions between the
more littoral and the more pelagic areas and the different depths
and nature of the sea-bottom. Independently of those ascending and
descending movements which have given rise to the superposition of
the limestones and clays, and by which the position of land and sea
