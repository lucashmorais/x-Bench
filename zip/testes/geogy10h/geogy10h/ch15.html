<p><b>Line between Miocene and Eocene Formations.</b>&mdash;The
marine faluns of the valley of the Loire have been already
described as resting in some places on a fresh-water tertiary
limestone, fragments of which have been broken off and rolled on
the shores and in the bed of the Miocene sea. Such pebbles are
frequent at Pontlevoy on the Cher, with hollows drilled in them in
which the perforating marine shells of the Falunian period still
remain. Such a mode of superposition implies an interval of time
between the origin of the fresh-water limestone and its submergence
beneath the waters of the Upper Miocene sea. The limestone in
question forms a part of the formation called the Calcaire de la
Beauce, which constitutes a large table-land between the basins of
the Loire and the Seine. It is associated with marls and other
deposits, such as may have been formed in marshes and shallow lakes
in the newest part of a great delta. Beds of flint, continuous or
in nodules, accumulated in these lakes, and aquatic plants called
Charae, left their stems and seed-vessels imbedded both in the marl
and flint, together with fresh-water and land shells. Some of the
siliceous rocks of this formation are used extensively for
mill-stones. The flat summits or platforms of the hills round
Paris, and large areas in the forest of Fontainebleau, as well as
the Plateau de la Beauce, already alluded to, are chiefly composed
of these fresh-water strata. Next to these in the descending order
are marine sands and sandstone, commonly called the Gres de
Fontainebleau, from which a considerable number of shells, very
distinct from those of the faluns, have been obtained at Etampes,
south of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 231">[ 231 ]</a></p>

<p>Paris, and at Montmartre and other hills in Paris itself, or in
its suburbs. At the bottom of these sands a green clay occurs,
containing a small oyster, <i>Ostrea cyathula,</i> Lam., which,
although of slight thickness, is spread over a wide area. This clay
rests immediately on the Paris gypsum, or that series of beds of
gypsum and gypseous marl from which Cuvier first obtained several
species of Pal&aelig;otherium and other extinct mammalia.*</p>

<p>At this junction of the clay and the gypsum the majority of
French geologists have always drawn the line between the Middle and
Lower Tertiary, or between the Miocene and Eocene formations,
regarding the Fontainebleau sands and the <i>Ostrea cyathula</i>
clay as the base of the Miocene, and the gypsum, with its mammalia,
as the top of the Eocene group. I formerly dissented from this
division, but I now find that I must admit it to be the only one
which will agree with the distribution of the Miocene mammalia,
while even the mollusca of the Fontainebleau sands, which were
formerly supposed to present at preponderance of affinities to an
Eocene fauna, have since been shown to agree more closely with the
fossils of certain deposits always regarded as Middle Tertiary at
Mayence and in Belgium. In fact, we are now arriving at that stage
of progress when the line, wherever it be drawn between Miocene and
Eocene, will be an arbitrary one, or one of mere convenience, as I
shall have an opportunity of showing when the Upper Eocene
formations in the Isle of Wight are described in the sixteenth
chapter.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene of Central France.</b>&mdash;Lacustrine strata,
belonging, for the most part, to the same Miocene system as the
Calcaire de la Beauce, are again met with farther south in
Auvergne, Cantal, and V&eacute;lay. They appear to be the monuments
of ancient lakes, which, like some of those now existing in
Switzerland, once occupied the depressions in a mountainous region,
and have been each fed by one or more rivers and torrents. The
country where they occur is almost entirely composed of granite and
different varieties of granitic schist, with here and there a few
patches of Secondary strata, much dislocated, and which have
suffered great denudation. There are also some vast piles of
volcanic matter, the greater part of which is newer than the
fresh-water strata, and is sometimes seen to rest upon them, while
a small part has evidently been of contemporaneous origin. Of these
igneous rocks I shall treat more particularly in the sequel.</p>

<p>The study of these regions possesses a peculiar interest very
distinct in kind from that derivable from the investigation</p>

<p class="fnote">* Bulletin, 1856, Journ., vol. xii, p. 768.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 232">[ 232 ]</a></p>

<p>either of the Parisian or English Tertiary areas. For we are
presented in Auvergne with the evidence of a series of events of
astonishing magnitude and grandeur, by which the original form and
features of the country have been greatly changed, yet never so far
obliterated but that they may still, in part at least, be restored
in imagination. Great lakes have disappeared&mdash;lofty mountains have
been formed, by the reiterated emission of lava, preceded and
followed by showers of sand and scori&aelig;&mdash;deep valleys have
been subsequently furrowed out through masses of lacustrine and
volcanic origin&mdash;at a still later date, new cones have been thrown
up in these valleys&mdash;new lakes have been formed by the damming up
of rivers&mdash;and more than one assemblage of quadrupeds, birds, and
plants, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, have followed in succession;
yet the region has preserved from first to last its geographical
identity; and we can still recall to our thoughts its external
condition and physical structure before these wonderful
vicissitudes began, or while a part only of the whole had been
completed. There was first a period when the spacious lakes, of
which we still may trace the boundaries, lay at the foot of
mountains of moderate elevation, unbroken by the bold peaks and
precipices of Mont Dor, and unadorned by the picturesque outline of
the Puy de Dome, or of the volcanic cones and craters now covering
the granitic platform. During this earlier scene of repose deltas
were slowly formed; beds of marl and sand, several hundred feet
thick, deposited; siliceous and calcareous rocks precipitated from
the waters of mineral springs; shells and insects imbedded,
together with the remains of the crocodile and tortoise, the eggs
and bones of water-birds, and the skeletons of quadrupeds, most of
them of genera and species characteristic of the Miocene period. To
this tranquil condition of the surface succeeded the era of
volcanic eruptions, when the lakes were drained, and when the
fertility of the mountainous district was probably enhanced by the
igneous matter ejected from below, and poured down upon the more
sterile granite. During these eruptions, which appear to have taken
place towards the close of the Miocene epoch, and which continued
during the Pliocene, various assemblages of quadrupeds successively
inhabited the district, among which are found the genera mastodon,
rhinoceros, elephant, tapir, hippopotamus, together with the ox,
various kinds of deer, the bear, hy&aelig;na, and many beasts of
prey which ranged the forest or pastured on the plain, and were
occasionally overtaken by a fall of burning cinders, or buried in
flows of mud, such as accompany volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 233">[ 233 ]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, these quadrupeds became extinct, and gave place in their
turn to the species now existing. There are no signs, during the
whole time required for this series of events, of the sea having
intervened, nor of any denudation which may not have been
accomplished by currents in the different lakes, or by rivers and
floods accompanying repeated earthquakes, or subterranean
movements, during which the levels of the district have in some
places been materially modified, and perhaps the whole upraised
relatively to the surrounding parts of France.</p>

<p><i class="2">Auvergne.</i>&mdash;The most northern of the
fresh-water groups is situated in the valley-plain of the Allier,
which lies within the department of the Puy de Dome, being the
tract which went formerly by the name of the Limagne
d&rsquo;Auvergne. The average breadth of this tract is about twenty
miles; and it is for the most part composed of nearly horizontal
strata of sand, sandstone, calcareous marl, clay, and limestone,
none of which observe a fixed and invariable order of
superposition. The ancient borders of the lake wherein the
fresh-water strata were accumulated may generally be traced with
precision, the granite and other ancient rocks rising up boldly
from the level country. The actual junction, however, of the
lacustrine beds and the granite is rarely seen, as a small valley
usually intervenes between them. The fresh-water strata may
sometimes be seen to retain their horizontality within a very
slight distance of the border-rocks, while in some places they are
inclined, and in few instances vertical. The principal divisions
into which the lacustrine series may be separated are the
following:&mdash;first, Sandstone, grit, and conglomerate, including red
marl and red sandstone; secondly, Green and white foliated marls;
thirdly, Limestone, or travertin, often oolitic in structure;
fourthly, Gypseous marls.</p>

<p>The relations of these different groups can not be learnt by the
study of any one section; and the geologist who sets out with the
expectation of finding a fixed order of succession may perhaps
complain that the different parts of the basin give contradictory
results. The arenaceous division, the marls, and the limestone may
all be seen in some places to alternate with each other; yet it can
by no means be affirmed that there is no order of arrangement. The
sands, sandstone, and conglomerate constitute in general a littoral
group; the foliated white and green marl, a contemporaneous central
deposit more than 700 feet thick, and thinly foliated, a character
which often arises from the innumerable thin shells or carapace
valves shed by the small crustacean</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 234">[ 234 ]</a></p>

<p>called <i>Cypris</i> in the ancient lakes of Auvergne; and
lastly the limestone is for the most part subordinate to the newer
portions of both the above formations.</p>

<p>It seems that, when the ancient lake of the Limagne first began
to be filled with sediment, no volcanic action had yet produced
lava and scori&aelig; on any part of the surface of Auvergne. No
pebbles, therefore, of lava were transported into the lake&mdash;no
fragments of volcanic rocks imbedded in the conglomerate. But at a
later period, when a considerable thickness of sandstone and marl
had accumulated, eruptions broke out, and lava and tuff were
deposited, at some spots, alternately with the lacustrine strata.
It is not improbable that cold and thermal springs, holding
different mineral ingredients in solution, became more numerous
during the successive convulsions attending this development of
volcanic agency, and thus deposits of carbonate and sulphate of
lime, silex, and other minerals were produced. Hence these minerals
predominate in the uppermost strata. The subterranean movements may
then have continued until they altered the relative levels of the
country, and caused the waters of the lakes to be drained off, and
the further accumulation of regular fresh-water strata to
cease.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene Mammalia of the Limagne.</b>&mdash;It is
scarcely possible to determine the age of the oldest part of the
fresh-water series of the Limagne, large masses both of the sandy
and marly strata being devoid of fossils. Some of the lowest beds
may be of Upper Eocene date, although, according to M. Pomel, only
one bone of a <i>Pal&aelig;otherium</i> has been discovered in
Auvergne. But in V&eacute;lay, in strata containing some species of
fossil mammalia common to the Limagne, no less than four species of
Pal&aelig;othere have been found by M. Aymard, and one of these is
generally supposed to be identical with <i>Pal&aelig;otherium
magnum,</i> an undoubted Upper Eocene fossil, of the Paris gypsum,
the other three being peculiar.</p>

<p>Not a few of the other mammalia of the Limagne belong
undoubtedly to genera and species elsewhere proper to the Lower
Miocene. Thus, for example, the Cainotherium of Bravard, a genus
not far removed from the Anoplotherium, is represented by several
species, one of which, as I learn from Mr. Waterhouse, agrees with
<i>Microtherium Renggeri</i> of the Mayence basin. In like manner,
the <i>Amphitragulus elegans</i> of Pomel, an Auvergne fossil, is
identified by Waterhouse with <i>Dorcatherium nanum</i> of Kaup, a
Rhenish species from Weissenau, near Mayence. A small species,
also, of rodent, of the genus Titanomys of H. von Meyer, is common
to the Lower Miocene of Mayence and the Limagne</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 235">[ 235 ]</a></p>

<p>d&rsquo;Auvergne, and there are many other points of agreement
which the discordance of nomenclature tends to conceal. A
remarkable carnivorous genus, the Hy&aelig;nodon of Laizer, is
represented by more than one species. The same genus has also been
found in the Upper Eocene marls of Hordwell Cliff, Hampshire, just
below the level of the Bembridge Limestone, and therefore a
formation older than the Gypsum of Paris. Several species of
opossum (<i>Didelphis</i>) are met with in the same strata of the
Limagne. The total number of mammalia enumerated by M. Pomel as
appertaining to the Lower Miocene fauna of the Limagne and Velay
falls little short of a hundred, and with them are associated some
large crocodiles and tortoises, and some Ophidian and Batrachian
reptiles.</p>

<p><b>Lower Molasse of Switzerland.</b>&mdash;The two upper
divisions of the Swiss Molasse&mdash;the one fresh-water, the other
marine&mdash;have already been described in the preceding chapter. I
shall now proceed to treat of the third division, which is of Lower
Miocene age. Nearly the whole of this Lower Molasse is fresh-water,
yet some of the inferior beds contain a mixture of marine and
fluviatile shells, the <i>Cerithium margaritaceum,</i> a well-known
Lower Miocene fossil, being one of the marine species.
Notwithstanding, therefore, that some of these Lower Miocene strata
consist of old shingle-beds several thousand feet in thickness, as
in the Rigi, near Lucerne, and in the Speer, near Wesen, mountains
5000 and 7000 feet above the sea, the deposition of the whole
series must have begun at or below the sea-level.</p>

<p>The conglomerates, as might be expected, are often very unequal
in thickness, in closely adjoining districts, since in a littoral
formation accumulations of pebbles would swell out in certain
places where rivers entered the sea, and would thin out to
comparatively small dimensions where no streams or only small ones
came down to the coast. For ages, in spite of a gradual depression
of the land and adjacent sea-bottom, the rivers continued to cover
the sinking area with their deltas; until finally, the subsidence
being in excess, the sea of the Middle Molasse gained upon the
land, and marine beds were thrown down over the dense mass of
fresh-water and brackish-water deposit, called the Lower Molasse,
which had previously accumulated.</p>

<p><b>Flora of the Lower Molasse.</b>&mdash;In part of the Swiss
Molasse, which belongs exclusively to the Lower Miocene period, the
number of plants has been estimated at more than 500 species,
somewhat exceeding those which were before enumerated as occurring
in the two upper divisions. The Swiss Lower</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 236">[ 236 ]</a></p>

<p>Miocene may best be studied on the northern borders of the Lake
of Geneva, between Lausanne and Vevay, where the contiguous
villages of Monod and Rivaz are situated. The strata there, which I
have myself examined, consist of alternations of conglomerate,
sandstone, and finely laminated marls with fossil plants. A small
stream falls in a succession of cascades over the harder beds of
pudding-stone, which resist, while the sandstone and plant-bearing
shales and marls give way. From the latter no less than 193 species
of plants have been obtained by the exertions of MM. Heer and
Gaudin, and they are considered to afford a true type of the
vegetation of the Lower Miocene formations of Switzerland&mdash;a
vegetation departing farther in its character from that now
flourishing in Europe than any of the higher members of the series
before alluded to, and yet displaying so much affinity to the flora
of &OElig;ningen as to make it natural for the botanist to refer
the whole to one and the same Miocene period. There are, indeed, no
less than 81 species of these Older Miocene plants which pass up
into the flora of &OElig;ningen.</p>

<p>This fact is important as bearing on the propriety of classing
the Lower Molasse of Switzerland as belonging to the Miocene rather
than to the latter part of the Eocene period. There are, indeed, so
many types among the fossils, both specific and generic, which have
a wide range through the whole of the Molasse, that a unity of
character is thereby stamped on the whole flora, in spite of the
contrast between the plants of the uppermost and lowest formations,
or between Oeningen and Monod. The proofs of a warmer climate, and
the excess of arborescent over herbaceous plants, and of evergreen
trees over deciduous species, are characters common to the whole
flora, but which are intensified as we descend to the inferior
deposits.</p>

<p>Nearly all the plants at Monod are contained in three layers of
marl separated by two of soft sandstone. The thickness of the marls
is ten feet, and vegetable matter predominates so much in some
layers as to form an imperfect lignite. One bed is filled with
large leaves of a species of fig (<i>Ficus populina</i>), and of a
hornbeam (<i>Carpinus grandis</i>), the strength of the wind having
probably been great when they were blown into the lake; whereas
another contiguous layer contains almost exclusively smaller
leaves, indicating, apparently, a diminished strength in the wind.
Some of the upper beds at Monod abound in leaves of
Proteace&aelig;, Cyperace&aelig;, and ferns, while in some of the
lower ones <i>Sequoia, Cinnamomum,</i> and <i>Sparganium</i> are
common. In one bed of sandstone the trunk of a large palm-tree was
found</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 237">[ 237 ]</a></p>

<p>unaccompanied by other fossils, and near Vevay, in the same
series of Lower Miocene strata, the leaves of a palm of the genus
<i>Sabal</i> (Fig. 151), a genus now proper to America, were
obtained.</p>

<img src="images1/fig151.jpg" width="174" height="226" alt=
"Fig. 151: Sabal major" align="right"> 

<p>Among other genera of the same class is a <i>Flabellaria</i>
occurring near Lausanne, and a magnificent <i>Ph&oelig;nicites</i>
allied to the date palm. When these plants flourished the climate
must have been much hotter than now. The Alps were no doubt much
lower, and the palms now found fossil in strata elevated 2000 feet
above the sea grew nearly at the sea-level, as is demonstrated by
the brackish-water character of some of the beds into which they
were carried by winds or rivers from the adjoining coast.</p>

<p>In the same plant-bearing deposits of the Lower Molasse in
Switzerland leaves have been found which have been ascribed to the
order Proteace&aelig; already spoken of as well represented in the
&OElig;ningen beds (see <a href="ch14.html#page 221">p. 221</a>).
The Proteas and other plants of this family now flourish at the
Cape of Good Hope; while the Banksias, and a set of genera distinct
from those of Africa, grow most luxuriantly in the southern and
temperate parts of Australia. They were probably inhabitants, says
Heer, of dry hilly ground, and the stiff leathery character of
their leaves must have been favourable to their preservation,
allowing them to float on a river for great distances without being
injured, and then to sink, when water-logged, to the bottom. It has
been objected that the fruit of the Proteace&aelig; is of so tough
and enduring a texture that it ought to have been more commonly met
with; but in the first place we must not forget the numerous cones
found in the Eocene strata of Sheppey, which all admit to be
proteaceous and to belong to at least two species (see <a href=
"ch14.html#page 222">p. 222</a>). Secondly, besides the fruit of
Hakea before mentioned (<a href="ch14.html#page 221">p. 221</a>),
Heer found associated with fossil leaves, having the exact form and
nervation of Banksia, fruit precisely such as may have come from a
cone of that plant, and lately he has received another similar
fruit from the Lower Miocene strata of Lucerne. They may have
fallen out of a decayed cone in the same way as often happens to
the seeds of the spruce fir, <i>Pinus abies,</i> found scattered
over the ground in our woods. It is a known fact that</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 238">[ 238 ]</a></p>

<p>among the living Proteace&aelig; the cones are very firmly
attached to the branches, so that the seeds drop out without the
cone itself falling to the ground, and this may perhaps be the
reason why, in some instances in which fossil seeds have been
found, no traces of the cone have been observed.</p>

<center><img src="images1/fig152.jpg" width="413" height="236" alt=
"Fig. 152: Fruit of fossil Banksia and leaf of Banksia. Fig. 153: Sequoia Langsdorfii.">
</center>

<p>Among the Conifer&aelig; the Sequoia here figured is common at
Rivaz, and is one of the most universal plants in the Lowest
Miocene of Switzerland, while it also characterises the Miocene
Brown Coals of Germany and certain beds of the Val d&rsquo;Arno,
which I have called Older Pliocene, <a href="ch13.html#page 208">p.
208</a>.</p>

<img src="images1/fig154.jpg" width="237" height="282" alt=
"Fig. 154: Lastr&aelig;a stiriaca." align="left"> 

<p>Among the ferns met with in profusion at Monod is the <i>
Lastr&aelig;a stiriaca,</i> Unger, which has a wide range in the
Miocene period from strata of the age of &OElig;ningen to the
lowest part of the Swiss Molasse. In some specimens, as shown in
Fig. 154, the fructification is distinctly seen.</p>

<p>Among the laurels several species of <i>Cinnamomum</i> are very
conspicuous. Besides the <i>C. polymorphum,</i> before figured, <a
href="ch14.html#page 219">p. 219</a>, another species also ranges
from the Lower to the Upper Molasse of Switzerland, and</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 239">[ 239 ]</a></p>

<img src="images1/fig155.jpg" width="183" height="339" alt=
"Fig. 155: Cinnamomum Rossm&auml;ssleri." align="right"> 

<p>is very characteristic of different deposits of Brown Coal in
Germany. It has been called <i>Cinnamomum Rossm&auml;ssleri</i> by
Heer (see Fig. 155). The leaves are easily recognised as having two
side veins, which run up uninterruptedly to their point.</p>

<p><b>American Character of the Flora.</b>&mdash;If we consider not
merely the number of species but those plants which constitute the
mass of the Lower Miocene vegetation, we find the European part of
the fossil flora very much less prominent than in the &OElig;ningen
beds, while the foreground is occupied by American forms, by
evergreen oaks, maples, poplars, planes, Liquidambar, Robinia,
Sequoia, Taxodium, and ternate-leaved pines. There is also a much
greater fusion of the characters now belonging to distinct
botanical provinces than in the Upper Miocene flora, and we shall
find this fusion still more strikingly exemplified as we go back to
the antecedent Eocene and Cretaceous periods.</p>

<p>Professor Heer has advocated the doctrine, first advanced by
Unger to explain the large number of American genera in the Miocene
flora of Europe, that the present basin of the Atlantic was
occupied by land over which the Miocene flora could pass freely.
But other able botanists have shown that it is far more probable
that the American plants came from the east and not from the west,
and instead of reaching Europe by the shortest route over an
imaginary Atlantis, migrated in an opposite direction, crossing the
whole of Asia.</p>

<p><b>Arctic Miocene Flora.</b>&mdash;But when we indulge in
speculations as to the geographical origin of the Miocene plants of
Central Europe, we must take into account the discoveries recently
made of a rich terrestrial flora having flourished in the Arctic
Regions in the Miocene period from which many species may have
migrated from a common centre so as to reach the present continents
of Europe, Asia, and America. Professor Heer has examined the
various collections of fossil plants that have been obtained in
North Greenland (lat. 70&deg;), Iceland, Spitzbergen, and other
parts of the Arctic regions,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 240">[ 240 ]</a></p>

<p>and has determined that they are of Miocene age and indicate a
temperate climate.* Including the collections recently brought from
Greenland by Mr. Whymper, the Arctic Miocene flora now comprises
194 species, and that of Greenland 137 species, of which 46, or
exactly one-third, are identical with plants found in the Miocene
beds of Central Europe. Considerably more than half the number are
trees, which is the more remarkable since, at the present day,
trees do not exist in any part of Greenland even 10 degrees farther
south.</p>

<p>More than thirty species of Conifer&aelig; have been found,
including several Sequoias (allied to the gigantic Wellingtonia of
California), with species of Thujopsis and Salisburia now peculiar
to Japan. There are also beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples,
walnuts, limes, and even a magnolia, two cones of which have
recently been obtained, proving that this splendid evergreen not
only lived but ripened its fruit within the Arctic circle. Many of
the limes, planes, and oaks were large-leaved species, and both
flowers and fruit, besides immense quantities of leaves, are in
many cases preserved. Among the shrubs were many evergreens, as <i>
Andromeda,</i> and two extinct genera, <i>Daphnogene</i> and <i>
M&lsquo;Clintockia,</i> with fine leathery leaves, together with
hazel, blackthorn, holly, logwood, and hawthorn. A species of Zamia
(<i>Zamites</i>) grew in the swamps, with <i>Potamogeton,
Sparganium,</i> and <i>Menyanthes,</i> while ivy and vines twined
around the forest trees and broad-leaved ferns grew beneath their
shade. Even in Spitzbergen, as far north as latitude 78&deg; 56',
no less than ninety-five species of fossil plants have been
obtained, including <i>Taxodium</i> of two species, hazel, poplar,
alder, beech, plane-tree, and lime. Such a vigorous growth of trees
within 12 degrees of the pole, where now a dwarf willow and a few
herbaceous plants form the only vegetation, and where the ground is
covered with almost perpetual snow and ice, is truly
remarkable.</p>

<p>The identity of so many of the fossils with Miocene species of
Central Europe and Italy not only proves that the climate of
Greenland was much warmer than it is now, but also renders it
probable that a much more uniform climate prevailed over the entire
northern hemisphere. This is also indicated by the whole character
of the Upper Miocene flora of Central Europe, which does not
necessitate a mean temperature very much greater than exists at
present, if we suppose such absence of winter cold as is proper to
insular climates. Professor Heer believes that the mean temperature
of North Greenland must have been at least 30 degrees higher than
at present,</p>

<p>while an addition of 10 degrees to the mean temperature of
Central Europe would probably be as much as was required. The chief
locality where this wonderful flora is preserved is at Atanekerdluk
in North Greenland (lat. 70&deg;), on a hill at an elevation of
about 1200 feet above the sea. There is here a considerable
succession of sedimentary strata pierced by volcanic rocks. Fossil
plants occur in all the beds, and the erect trunks as thick as a
man&rsquo;s body which are sometimes found, together with the
abundance of specimens of flowers and fruit in good preservation,
sufficiently prove that the plants grew where they are now found.
At Disco island and other localities on the same part of the coast,
good coal is abundant, interstratified with beds of sandstone, in
some of which fossil plants have also been found, similar to those
at Atanekerdluk.</p>

Miocene, Belgium.</b>&mdash;The Upper Miocene Bolderberg beds,
mentioned in <a href="ch14.html#page 224">p. 224</a>, rest on a
Lower Miocene formation called the Rupelian of Dumont. This
formation is best seen at the villages of Rupelmonde and Boom, ten
miles south of Antwerp, on the banks of the Scheldt and near the
junction with it of a small stream called the Rupel. A stiff clay
abounding in fossils is extensively worked at the above localities
for making tiles. It attains a thickness of about 100 feet, and
though very different in age, much resembles in mineral character
the &ldquo;London clay,&rdquo; containing, like it, septaria or
concretions of argillaceous limestone traversed by cracks in the
interior, which are filled with calc-spar. The shells, referable to
about forty species, have been described by MM. Nyst and De
Koninck. Among them <i>Leda</i> (or Nucula) <i>Deshayesiana</i>
(see Fig. 156) is by far the most abundant; a fossil unknown as yet
in the English tertiary strata, but when young much resembling Leda
amygdaloides of the London Clay proper (see <a href=
"images1/fig213.jpg">Fig. 213</a>). Among other characteristic
shells are <i>Pecten H&oelig;ninghausii,</i> and a species of <i>
Cassidaria,</i> and several of the genus <i>Pleurotoma.</i> Not a
few of these testacea agree with English Eocene species, such as
<i>Act&aelig;on simulatus,</i> Sowb, <i>Cancellaria evulsa,</i>
Brander, <i>Corbula pisum</i> (<a href="images1/fig157.jpg">Fig.
157</a>), and <i>Nautilus (Aturia) ziczac.</i> They are accompanied
by many teeth of sharks, as <i>Lamna contortidens,</i> Ag., <i>
Oxyrhinaxiphodon,</i> Ag., <i>Carcharodon angustidens</i> (see <a

strata.</p>

<p><i class="2">Kleyn Spawen beds.</i>&mdash;The succession of the
Lower Miocene strata of Belgium can be best studied in the environs
of Kleyn Spawen, a village situated about seven miles west of
Maestricht, in the old province of Limburg in Belgium. In that
region, about 200 species of testacea, marine and fresh-water, have
been obtained, with many foraminifera and remains of fish. In none
of the Belgian Lower Miocene strata could I find any nummulites;
and M. d&rsquo;Archiac had previously observed that these
foraminifera characterise his &ldquo;Lower Tertiary Series,&rdquo;
as contrasted with the Middle, and they therefore serve as a good
test of age between Eocene and Miocene, at least in Belgium and the
North of France.* Between the Bolderberg beds and the Rupelian clay
there is a great gap in Belgium, which seems, according to M.
Beyrich, to be filled up in the North of Germany by what he calls
the Sternberg beds, and which, had Dumont found them in Belgium, he
might probably have termed Upper Rupelian.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene of Germany.&mdash;</b><i class="2">Rupelian
Clay of Hermsdorf, near Berlin.</i>&mdash;Professor Beyrich has
described a mass of clay, used for making tiles, within seven miles
of the gates of Berlin, near the village of Hermsdorf, rising up
from beneath the sands with which that country is chiefly
overspread. This clay is more than forty feet thick, of a dark
bluish-grey colour, and, like that of Rupelmonde, contains
septaria. Among other shells, the <i>Leda Deshayesiana,</i> before
mentioned (Fig. 156), abounds, together with many species of <i>
Pleurotoma, Voluta,</i> etc., a certain proportion of the fossils
being identical in species with those of Rupelmonde.</p>

<p><i class="2">Mayence Basin.</i>&mdash;An elaborate description
has been published by Dr. F. Sandberger of the Mayence tertiary
area, which occupies a tract from five to twelve miles in breadth,
extending for a great distance along the left bank of the Rhine
from Mayence to the neighbourhood of Manheim, and which is also
found to the east, north, and south-west of Frankfort. M. De
Koninck, of Liege, first pointed out to me that the purely marine
portion of the deposit contained many species of shells common to
the Kleyn Spawen beds, and to the clay of Rupelmonde, near Antwerp.
Among these he mentioned <i>Cassidaria depressa, Tritonium
argutum,</i> Brander (<i>T. flandricum,</i> De Koninck), <i>
Tornatella simulata, Aporrhais Sowbyi, Leda Deshayesiana</i> (Fig.
156), <i>Corbula pisum,</i> (Fig. 158) and others.</p>

<p>near Angram in Croatia, not far from the borders of Styria, is
covered, says Von Buch, by beds containing the marine shells of the
Vienna basin, or, in other words, by Upper Miocene or Falunian
strata. They appear to correspond in age to the Mayence basin, or
to the Rupelian strata of Belgium. They have yielded more than 200
species of fossil plants, described by the late Professor Unger.
These plants are well preserved in a hard marlstone, and contain
several palms; among them the Sabal, <a href="images1/fig151.jpg">
Fig. 151,</a> p. 237, and another genus allied to the date-palm <i>
Ph&oelig;nicites spectabilis.</i> The only abundant plant among the
Radaboj fossils which is characteristic of the Upper Miocene period
is the <i>Populus mutabilis,</i> whereas no less than fifty of the
Radaboj species are common to the more ancient flora of the Lower
Molasse of Switzerland.</p>

<center><img src="images1/fig157.jpg" width="317" height="214" alt=
"Fig. 157: Vanessa Pluto."></center>

<p>The insect fauna is very rich, and, like the plants, indicates a
more tropical climate than do the fossils of &OElig;ningen
presently to be mentioned. There are ten species of Termites, or
white ants, some of gigantic size, and large dragon-flies with
speckled wings, like those of the Southern States in North America;
there are also grasshoppers of considerable size, and even the
Lepidoptera are not unrepresented. In one instance, the pattern of
a butterfly&rsquo;s wing has escaped obliteration in the marl-stone
of Radaboj; and when we reflect on the remoteness of the time from
which it has been faithfully transmitted to us, this fact may
inspire the reader with some confidence as to the reliable nature
of the characters which other insects of a more durable texture,
such as the beetles, may afford for specific determination. The
Vanessa above figured retains, says Heer, some of its colours, and
corresponds with <i>V. Hadena</i> of India.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 244">[ 244 ]</a></p>

<p>Professor Beyrich has made known to us the existence of a long
succession of marine strata in North Germany, which lead by an
almost gradual transition from beds of Upper Miocene age to others
of the age of the base of the Lower Miocene. Although some of the
German lignites called Brown Coal belong to the upper parts of this
series, the most important of them are of Lower Miocene date, as,
for example, those of the Siebengebirge, near Bonn, which are
associated with volcanic rocks.</p>

<p>Professor Beyrich confines the term &ldquo;Miocene&rdquo; to
those strata which agree in age with the faluns of Touraine, and he
has proposed the term &ldquo;Oligocene&rdquo; for those older
formations called Lower Miocene in this work.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene of Italy.</b>&mdash;In the hills of which the
Superga forms a part there is a great series of Tertiary strata
which pass downward into the Lower Miocene. Even in the Superga
itself there are some fossil plants which, according to Heer, have
never been found in Switzerland so high as the marine Molasse, such
as <i>Banksia longifolia,</i> and <i>Carpinus grandis.</i> In
several parts of the Ligurian Apennines, as at D&eacute;go and
Carcare, the Lower Miocene appears, containing some nummulites, and
at Cadibona, north of Savona, fresh-water strata of the same age
occur, with dense beds of lignite inclosing remains of the <i>
Anthracotherium magnum</i> and <i>A. minimum,</i> besides other
mammalia enumerated by Gastaldi. In these beds a great number of
the Lower Miocene plants of Switzerland have been discovered.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene of England&mdash;Hempstead Beds.</b>&mdash;We
have already stated that the Upper Miocene formation is nowhere
represented in the British Isles; but strata referable to the Lower
Miocene period are found both in England, Scotland, and Ireland. In
the Hampshire basin these occupy a very small superficial area,
having been discovered by the late Edward Forbes at Hempstead near
Yarmouth, in the northern part of the Isle of Wight, where they are
170 feet thick, and rich in characteristic marine shells. They
overlie the uppermost of an extensive series of Eocene deposits of
marine, brackish, and fresh-water formations, which rest on the
Chalk and terminate upward in strata corresponding in age to the
Paris gypsum, and containing the same extinct genera of quadrupeds,
<i>Pal&aelig;otherium, Anoplotherium,</i> and others which Cuvier
first described. The following is the succession of these Lower
Miocene strata, most of them exposed in a cliff east of
Yarmouth:</p>

<p>1. The uppermost or Corbula beds, consisting of marine sands and
clays, contain <i>Voluta Rathieri,</i> a characteristic Lower
Miocene shell; <i>Corbula pisum</i> (Fig. 158), a species common to
the Upper Eocene clay of Barton; Cyrena semistriata (Fig. 159),
several Cerithia, and other shells peculiar to this series.</p>

<center><img src="images1/fig158.jpg" width="394" height="341" alt=
"Fig. 158: Corbula pisum. Fig. 159: Cyrena semistriata. Fig. 160: Cerithium plicatum. Fig. 161: Cerithium elegans. Fig. 162: Rissoa Chastelii. Fig. 163: Paludina lenta.">
</center>

<p>2. Next are fresh-water and estuary marls and carbonaceous clays
in the brackish-water portion of which are found abundantly <i>
Cerithium plicatum,</i> Lam. (Fig. 160), <i>Cerithium elegans</i>
(Fig. 161), and <i>Cerithium tricinctum</i>; also <i>Rissoa
Chastelii</i> (Fig. 162), a very common Kleyn Spawen shell, and
which occurs in each of the four subdivisions of the Hempstead
series down to its base, where it passes into the Bembridge beds.
In the fresh-water portion of the same beds <i>Paludina lenta</i>
(Fig. 163) occurs; a shell identified by some conchologists with a
species now living, <i>P. unicolor</i>; also several species of <i>
Lymneus, Planorbis,</i> and <i>Unio.</i></p>

<p>3. The next series, or middle fresh-water and estuary marls, are
distinguished by the presence of <i>Melania fasciata, Paludina
lenta,</i> and clays with <i>Cypris</i>; the lowest bed contains
<i>Cyrena semistriata</i> (Fig. 159), mingled with Cerithia and a
<i>panop&aelig;a.</i></p>

<p>4. The lower fresh-water and estuary marls contain <i>Melania
costata,</i> Sowerby, <i>Melanopsis,</i> etc. The bottom bed is
carbonaceous, and called the &ldquo;Black band,&rdquo; in which <i>
Rissoa Chastelii</i> (Fig. 162), before alluded to, is common. This
bed contains a mixture of Hempstead shells with those of the
underlying Upper Eocene or Bembridge series. The mammalia,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 246">[ 246 ]</a></p>

<p>among which is <i>Hyopotamus bovinus,</i> differ, so far as they
are known, from those of the Bembridge beds. Among the plants,
Professor Heer has recognised four species common to the lignite of
Bovey Tracey, a Lower Miocene formation presently to be described:
namely, <i>Sequoia Couttsi&aelig;,</i> Heer; <i>Andromeda
reticulata,</i> Ettings.; <i>Nelumbium (Nymph&oelig;a) doris,</i>
Heer; and <i>Carpolithes Websteri,</i> Brong.* The seed-vessels of
<i>Chara medicaginula,</i> Brong, and <i>C. helicteres</i> are
characteristic of the Hempstead beds generally.</p>

<p>The <i>Hyopotamus</i> belongs to the hog tribe, or the same
family as the Anthracotherium, of which seven species, varying in
size from the hippopotamus to the wild boar, have been found in
Italy and other part of Europe associated with the lignites of the
Lower Miocene period.</p>

<p><b>Lignites and Clays of Bovey Tracey,
Devonshire.</b>&mdash;Surrounded by the granite and other rocks of
the Dartmoor hills in Devonshire, is a formation of clay, sand, and
lignite, long known to geologists as the Bovey Coal formation,
respecting the age of which, until the year 1861, opinions were
very unsettled. This deposit is situated at Bovey Tracey, a village
distant eleven miles from Exeter in a south-west, and about as far
from Torquay in a north-west direction. The strata extend over a
plain nine miles long, and they consist of the materials of
decomposed and worn-down granite and vegetable matter, and have
evidently filled up an ancient hollow or lake-like expansion of the
valleys of the Bovey and Teign.</p>

<p>The lignite is of bad quality for economical purposes, as there
is a great admixture in it of iron pyrites, and it emits a
sulphurous odour, but it has been successfully applied to the
baking of pottery, for which some of the fine clays are well
adapted. Mr. Pengelly has confirmed Sir H. De la Beche&rsquo;s
opinion that much of the upper portion of this old lacustrine
formation has been removed by denudation.&dagger;</p>

<p>At the surface is a dense covering of clay and gravel with
angular stones probably of the Post-pliocene period, for in the
clay are three species of willow and the dwarf birch, <i>Betula
nana,</i> indicating a climate colder than that of Devonshire at
the present day.</p>

<p>Below this are Lower Miocene strata about 300 feet in thickness,
in the upper part of which are twenty-six beds of lignite, clay,
and sand, and at their base a ferruginous quartzose sand, varying
in thickness from two to twenty-seven</p>

Bovey Tracey, p. xvii, London, 1863.<br>

Dr. Oswald Heer.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 247">[ 247 ]</a></p>

<p>feet. Below this sand are forty-five beds of alternating lignite
and clay. No shells or bones of mammalia, and no insect, with the
exception of one fragment of a beetle (<i>Buprestis</i>); in a
word, no organic remains, except plants, have as yet been found.
These plants occur in fourteen of the beds&mdash;namely, in two of the
clays, and the rest in the lignites. One of the beds is a perfect
mat of the debris of a coniferous tree, called by Heer <i>Sequoia
Couttsi&aelig;,</i> intermixed with leaves of ferns. The same
Sequoia (before mentioned as a Hempstead fossil, p. 246) is spread
through all parts of the formation, its cones, and seeds, and
branches of every age being preserved. It is a species supplying a
link between <i>Sequoia Langsdorfii</i> (see <a href=
"images1/fig152.jpg">Fig. 153,</a> p. 238) and <i>S.
Sternbergi,</i> the widely spread fossil representatives of the two
living trees <i>S. sempervirens</i> and <i>S. gigantea</i> (or
Wellingtonia), both now confined to California. Another bed is full
of the large rhizomes of ferns, while two others are rich in
dicotyledonous leaves. In all, Professor Heer enumerates forty-nine
species of plants, twenty of which are common to the Miocene beds
of the Continent, a majority of them being characteristic of the
Lower Miocene. The new species, also of Bovey, are allied to plants
of the older Miocene deposits of Switzerland, Germany, and other
Continental countries. The grape-stones of two species of vine
occur in the clays, and leaves of the fig and seeds of a
water-lily. The oak and laurel have supplied many leaves. Of the
triple-nerved laurels several are referred to Cinnamomum. There are
leaves also of a palm of which the genus is not determined. Leaves
also of proteaceous forms, like some of the Continental fossils
before mentioned, occur, and ferns like the well-known <i>
Lastr&aelig;a stiriaca</i> (<a href="images1/fig154.jpg">Fig.
154,</a> p. 238), displaying at Bovey, as in Switzerland, its
fructification.</p>

<p>The croziers of some of the young ferns are very perfect, and
were at first mistaken by collectors for shells of the genus <i>
Planorbis.</i> On the whole, the vegetation of Bovey implies the
existence of a sub-tropical climate in Devonshire, in the Lower
Miocene period.</p>

<p><b>Scotland: Isle of Mull.</b>&mdash;In the sea-cliffs forming
the headland of Ardtun, on the west coast of Mull, in the Hebrides,
several bands of tertiary strata containing leaves of
dicotyledonous plants were discovered in 1851 by the Duke of
Argyll.* From his description it appears that there are three
leaf-beds, varying in thickness from 1&frac12; to 5&frac12; feet,
which are interstratified with volcanic tuff and trap, the whole
mass being about 130 feet in thickness. A sheet of basalt 40
feet</p>

<p class="fnote">* Quart. Geol. Journal, 1851, p. 19.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 248">[ 248 ]</a></p>

<p>thick covers the whole; and another columnar bed of the same
rock, ten feet thick, is exposed at the bottom of the cliff. One of
the leaf-beds consists of a compressed mass of leaves unaccompanied
by any stems, as if they had been blown into a marsh where a
species of <i>Equisetum</i> grew, of which the remains are
plentifully imbedded in clay.</p>

<p>It is supposed by the Duke of Argyll that this formation was
accumulated in a shallow lake or marsh in the neighbourhood of a
volcano, which emitted showers of ashes and streams of lava. The
tufaceous envelope of the fossils may have fallen into the lake
from the air as volcanic dust, or have been washed down into it as
mud from the adjoining land. Even without the aid of organic
remains we might have decided that the deposit was newer than the
chalk, for chalk-flints containing cretaceous fossils were detected
by the duke in the principal mass of volcanic ashes or tuff.*</p>

<p>The late Edward Forbes observed that some of the plants of this
formation resembled those of Croatia, described by Unger, and his
opinion has been confirmed by Professor Heer, who found that the
conifer most prevalent was the <i>Sequoia Langsdorfii</i> (<a href=
"images1/fig152.jpg">Fig. 153,</a> p. 238), also <i>Corylus
grossedentata,</i> a Lower Miocene species of Switzerland and of
Menat in Auvergne. There is likewise a plane-tree, the leaves of
which seem to agree with those of <i>Platanus aceroides</i> (<a
href="images1/fig141.jpg">Fig. 141</a>), and a fern which is as yet
peculiar to Mull, <i>Filicites hebridica,</i> Forbes.</p>

<p>These interesting discoveries in Mull led geologists to suspect
that the basalt of Antrim, in Ireland, and of the celebrated
Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, might be of the same age. The volcanic
rocks that overlie the chalk, and some of the strata associated
with and interstratified between masses of basalt, contain leaves
of dicotyledonous plants, somewhat imperfect, but resembling the
beech, oak, and plane, and also some conifer&aelig; of the genera
pine and Sequoia. The general dearth of strata in the British
Isles, intermediate in age between the formation of the Eocene and
Pliocene periods, may arise, says Professor Forbes, from the extent
of dry land which prevailed in that vast interval of time. If land
predominated, the only monuments we are likely ever to find of
Miocene date are those of lacustrine and volcanic origin, such as
the Bovey Coal in Devonshire, the Ardtun beds in Mull, or the
lignites and associated basalts in Antrim.</p>

River, lat. 42&deg; N., a tertiary formation occurs, consisting of

<p>limestone, marls, and siliceous clay, described by Dr. D. Dale
Owen,* in which many bones of extinct quadrupeds, and of chelonians
of land or fresh-water forms, are met with. Among these, Dr. Leidy
describes a gigantic quadruped, called by him <i>Titanotherium,</i>
nearly allied to the <i>Pal&aelig;otherium,</i> but larger than any
of the species found in the Paris gypsum. With these are several
species of the genus <i>Oreodon,</i> Leidy, uniting the characters
of pachyderms and ruminants also; <i>Eucrotaphus,</i> another new
genus of the same mixed character; two species of rhinoceros of the
sub-genus <i>Acerotherium,</i> a Lower Miocene form of Europe
before mentioned; two species of <i>Arch&aelig;otherium,</i> a
pachyderm allied to <i>Ch&aelig;ropotamus</i> and <i>
Hyracotherium</i>; also <i>P&aelig;brotherium,</i> an extinct
ruminant allied to <i>Dorcatherium,</i> Kaup; also <i>
Agriochoerus,</i> of Leidy, a ruminant allied to <i>
Merycopotamus</i> of Falconer and Cautley; and, lastly, a large
carnivorous animal of the genus <i>Machairodus,</i> the most
ancient example of which in Europe occurs in the Lower Miocene
strata of Auvergne, but of which some species are found in Pliocene
deposits. The turtles are referred to the genus <i>Testudo,</i> but
have some affinity to <i>Emys.</i> On the whole, the Nebraska
formation is probably newer than the Paris gypsum, and referable to
the Lower Miocene period, as above defined.</p>
