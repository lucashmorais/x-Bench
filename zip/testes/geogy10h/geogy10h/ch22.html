<p>In pursuing our examination of the strata in descending order,
we have next to pass from the base of the Secondary or Mesozoic to
the uppermost or newest of the Primary or Pal&aelig;ozoic
formations. As this point has been selected as a line of
demarkation for one of the three great divisions of the
fossiliferous series, the student might naturally expect that by
aid of lithological and pal&aelig;ontological characters he would
be able to recognise without difficulty a distinct break between
the newer and older group. But so far is this from being the case
in Great Britain, that nowhere have geologists found more
difficulty in drawing the line of separation than between the
Secondary and Primary series. The obscurity has arisen from the
great resemblance in colour and mineral character of the Triassic
and Permian red marls and sandstones, and the scarcity and often
total absence in them of organic remains. The thickness of the
strata belonging to each group amounts in some places to several
thousand feet; and by dint of a careful examination of their
geological position, and of those fossil, animal, and vegetable
forms which are occasionally met with in some members of each
series, it has at length been made clear that the older or Permian
rocks are more connected with the Primary or Pal&aelig;ozoic than
with the Secondary or Mesozoic strata already described.</p>

<p>The term Permian has been proposed for this group by</p>

<p>Sir R. Murchison, from Perm, a Russian province, where it
occupies an area twice the size of France, and contains a great
abundance and variety of fossils, both vertebrate and invertebrate.
Professor Sedgwick in 1832* described what is now recognised as the
central member of this group, the Magnesian limestone, showing that
it attained a thickness of 600 feet along the north-east of
England, in the counties of Durham, Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire,
its lower part often passing into a fossiliferous marl-slate and
resting on an inferior Red Sandstone, the equivalent of the
Rothliegendes of Germany. It has since been shown that some of the
Red Sandstones of newer date also belong to the Permian group; and
it appears from the observations of Mr. Binney, Sir R. Murchison,
Mr. Harkness, and others, that it is in the region where the
limestone is most largely developed, as, for example, in the county
of Durham, that the associated red sandstones or sedimentary rocks
are thinnest, whereas in the country where the latter are thickest
the calcareous member is reduced to thirty, or even sometimes to
ten feet. It is clear, therefore, says Mr. Hull, that the
sedimentary region in the north of England area has been to the
westward, and the calcareous area to the eastward; and that in this
group there has been a development from opposite directions of the
two types of strata.</p>

<p>In illustration of this he has given us the following table:</p>

<p><b>Upper Permian.</b>&mdash;What is called in this table the
Upper Permian will be seen to attain its chief thickness in the
north-west, or on the coast of Cumberland, as at St. Bee&rsquo;s
Head, where it is described by Sir Roderick Murchison as consisting
of massive red sandstones with gypsum resting on a thin course of
Magnesian Limestone with fossils, which again is connected with the
Lower Red Sandstone, resembling the upper one in such a manner that
the whole forms a continuous series. No fossil footprints have been
found in this Upper as in the Lower Red Sandstone.</p>

<p><b>Middle Permian&mdash;Magnesian Limestone and
Marl-slate.</b>&mdash;This formation is seen upon the coast of
Durham and Yorkshire, between the Wear and the Tees. Among its
characteristic fossils are <i>Schizodus Schlotheimi</i> (Fig. 410)
and <i>Mytilus septifer</i> (Fig. 412). These shells occur at
Hartlepool and Sunderland, where the rock assumes an oolitic and
botryoidal character. Some of the beds in this division are
ripple-marked. In some parts of the coast of Durham, where the rock
is not crystalline, it contains as much as 44 per cent of carbonate
of magnesia, mixed with carbonate of lime. In other places&mdash;for it
is extremely variable in structure&mdash;it consists chiefly of
carbonate of lime, and has concreted into globular and
hemispherical masses, varying from the size of a marble to that of
a cannon-ball, and radiating from the centre. Occasionally earthy
and pulverulent beds pass into compact limestone or hard granular
dolomite. Sometimes the limestone appears in a brecciated form, the
fragments which are united together not consisting of foreign rocks
but seemingly composed of the breaking-up of the Permian limestone
itself, about the time of its consolidation. Some of the angular
masses in Tynemouth cliff are two feet in diameter.</p>

</center>

<p>The magnesian limestone sometimes becomes very fossiliferous and
includes in it delicate bryozoa, one of which, <i>Fenestella
retiformis</i> (Fig. 413), is a very variable species, and has
received many different names. It sometimes attains a large size,
single specimens measuring eight inches in width. The same
bryozoan, with several other British species, is also found
abundantly in the Permian of Germany.</p>

<p>The total known fauna of the Permian series of Great Britain at
present numbers 147 species, of which 77, or more than half, are
mollusca. Not one of these is common to rocks newer than the
Pal&aelig;ozoic, and the brachiopods are the only group which have
furnished species common to the more ancient or Carboniferous
rocks. Of these <i>Lingula Crednerii</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 388">[ 388 ]</a></p>

<p>(Fig. 415) is an example. There are 25 Gasteropods and only one
cephalopod, <i>Nautilus Freieslebeni,</i> which is also found in
the German Zechstein.</p>

<center><img src="images3/fig413.jpg" width="380" height="230" alt=
"Fig. 413: Magnesian Limestone.*"></center>

<p>Shells of the genera <i>Productus</i> (Fig. 414) and <i>
Strophalosia</i> (the latter of allied form with hinge teeth),
which do not occur in strata newer than the Permian, are abundant
in the ordinary yellow magnesian limestone, as will be seen in the
valuable memoirs of Messrs. King and Howse. They are accompanied by
certain species of <i>Spirifera</i> (Fig. 416), <i>Lingula
Crednerii</i> (Fig. 415), and other brachiopoda of the true primary
or pal&aelig;ozoic type. Some of this same tribe of shells, such as
Camarophoria, allied to Rhynchonella, Spiriferina, and two species
of <i>Lingula,</i> are specifically the same as fossils of the
carboniferous rocks. <i>Avicula, Arca,</i> and <i>Schizodus</i>
(Fig. 410), and other lamellibranchiate bivalves, are abundant, but
spiral univalves are very rare.</p>

<p>Beneath the limestone lies a formation termed the marl-stone,
which consists of hard calcareous shales, marl-slate, and
thin-bedded limestones. At East Thickley, in Durham, where</p>

<p>it is thirty feet thick, this slate has yielded many fine
specimens of fossil fish&mdash;of the genera <i>Pal&aelig;oniscus</i>
ten species, <i>Pygopterus</i> two species, <i>Coelacanthus</i> two
species, and <i>Platysomus</i> two species, which as genera are
common to the older Carboniferous formation, but the Permian
species are peculiar, and, for the most part, identical with those
found in the marl-slate or copper-slate of Thuringia.</p>

"Fig. 417: Restored outline of a fish of the genus Pal&aelig;oniscus. Fig. 418: Shark, Heterocercal. Fig. 419: Shad. (Clupea. Herring tribe.) Homocereal.">
</center>

<p>The <i>Pal&aelig;oniscus</i> above mentioned belongs to that
division of fishes which M. Agassiz has called
&ldquo;Heterocercal,&rdquo; which have their tails unequally
bilobate, like the recent shark and sturgeon, and the vertebral
column running along the upper caudal lobe. (See Fig. 418.) The
&ldquo;Homocercal&rdquo; fish, which comprise almost all the 9000
species at present known in the living creation, have the tail-fin
either single or equally divided; and the vertebral column stops
short, and is not prolonged into either lobe. (See Fig. 419.) Now
it is a singular fact, first pointed out by Agassiz, that the
heterocercal form, which is confined to a small number of genera in
the existing creation, is universal in the magnesian limestone, and
all the more ancient formations. It characterises the earlier
periods of the earth&rsquo;s history, whereas in the secondary
strata, or those newer than the Permian, the homocercal tail
predominates.</p>

<p>A full description has been given by Sir Philip Egerton of the
species of fish characteristic of the marl-slate, in Professor
King&rsquo;s monograph before referred to, where figures of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 390">[ 390 ]</a></p>

<p>ichthyolites, which are very entire and well preserved, will be
found. Even a single scale is usually so characteristically marked
as to indicate the genus, and sometimes even the particular
species. They are often scattered through the beds singly, and may
be useful to a geologist in determining the age of the rock.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Messrs. Hancock and Howse for the discovery
in this marl-slate at Midderidge, Durham, of two species of <i>
Protosaurus,</i> a genus of reptiles, one representative of which,
<i>P. Speneri,</i> has been celebrated ever since the year 1810 as
characteristic of the Kupfer-schiefer or Permian of Thuringia.
Professor Huxley informs us that the agreement of the Durham fossil
with Hermann von Meyer&rsquo;s figure of the German specimen is
most striking. Although the head is wanting in all the examples yet
found, they clearly belong to the Lacertian order, and are
therefore of a higher grade than any other vertebrate animal
hitherto found fossil in a Pal&aelig;ozoic rock. Remains of
Labyrinthodont reptiles have also been met with in the same slate
near Durham.</p>

<p><b>Lower Permian.</b>&mdash;The inferior sandstones which lie
beneath the marl-slate consist of sandstone and sand, separating
the Magnesian Limestone from the coal, in Yorkshire and Durham. In
some instances, red marl and gypsum have been found associated with
these beds. They have been classed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 391">[ 391 ]</a></p>

<p>with the Magnesian Limestone by Professor Sedgwick, as being
nearly co-extensive with it in geographical range, though their
relations are very obscure. But the principal development of Lower
Permian is, as we have seen by Mr. Hull&rsquo;s table <a href=
"#page 386">p. 386</a>, in the northwest, where the Penrith
sandstone, as it has been called, and the associated breccias and
purple shales are estimated by Professor Harkness to attain a
thickness of 3000 feet. Organic remains are generally wanting, but
the leaves and wood of coniferous plants, and in one case a cone,
have been found. Also in the purple marls of Corncockle Muir near
Dumfries, very distinct footprints of reptiles occur, originally
referred to the Trias, but shown by Mr. Binney in 1856 to be
Permian. No bones of the animals which they represent have yet been
discovered.</p>

<p><i>Angular Breccias in Lower Permian.</i>&mdash;A striking
feature in these beds is the occasional occurrence, especially at
the base of the formation, of angular and sometimes rounded
fragments of Carboniferous and older rocks of the adjoining
districts being included in a paste of red marl. Some of the
angular masses are of huge size.</p>

<p>In the central and southern counties, where the Middle Permian
or Magnesian Limestone is wanting, it is difficult to separate the
upper and lower sandstones, and Mr. Hull is of opinion that the
patches of this formation found here and there in Worcestershire,
Shropshire, and other counties may have been deposited in a sea
separated from the northern basin by a barrier of Carboniferous
rocks running east and west, and now concealed under the Triassic
strata of Cheshire. Similar breccias to those before described are
found in the more southern counties last mentioned, where their
appearance is rendered more striking by the marked contrast they
present to the beds of well-rolled and rounded pebbles of the Trias
occupying a large area in the same region.</p>

<p>Professor Ramsay refers the angular form and large size of the
fragments composing these breccias to the action of floating ice in
the sea. These masses of angular rock, some of them weighing more
than half a ton, and lying confusedly in a red, unstratified marl,
like stones in boulder-drift, are in some cases polished, striated,
and furrowed like erratic blocks in the moraine of a glacier. They
can be shown in some cases to have travelled from the parent rocks,
thirty or more miles distant, and yet not to have lost their
angular shape.*</p>

<p>The formation was well studied by the miners of that country a
century ago as containing a thin band of dark-coloured cupriferous
shale, characterised at Mansfield in Thuringia by numerous fossil
fish. Beneath some variegated sandstones (not belonging to the
Trias, though often confounded with it) they came down first upon a
dolomitic limestone corresponding to the upper part of our Middle
Permian, and then upon a marl-slate richly impregnated with copper
pyrites, and containing fish and reptiles (Protosaurus) identical
in species with those of the corresponding marl-slate of Durham. To
the limestone they gave the name of Zechstein, and to the
marl-slate that of Mergel-schiefer or Kupfer-schiefer. Beneath the
fossiliferous group lies the Rothliegendes or Rothtodt-liegendes,
meaning the red-lyer or red-dead-lyer, so-called by the German
miners from its colour, and because the copper had <i>died out</i>
when they reached this underlying non-metalliferous member of the
series. This red under-lyer is, in fact, a great deposit of red
sandstone, breccia, and conglomerate with associated porphyry,
basalt, and amygdaloid.</p>

<p>According to Sir R. Murchison, the Permian rocks are composed,
in Russia, of white limestone, with gypsum and white salt; and of
red and green grits, occasionally with copper ore; also magnesian
limestones, marl-stones, and conglomerates.</p>

"Fig. 426: Walchia piniformis."></center>

<p><b>Permian Flora.</b>&mdash;About 18 or 20 species of plants are
known in the Permian rocks of England. None of them pass down into
the Carboniferous series, but several genera, such as <i>
Alethopteris, Neuropteris, Walchia,</i> and <i>Ullmania,</i> are
common to the two groups. The Permian flora on the Continent
appears, from the researches of MM. Murchison and de Verneuil</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 393">[ 393 ]</a></p>

<p>in Russia, and of MM. Geinitz and von Gutbier in Saxony, to be,
with a few exceptions, distinct from that of the coal.</p>

<img src="images3/fig427.jpg" width="87" height="145" alt=
"Fig. 27: Cardiocarpon Ottonis." align="left"> 

<p>In the Permian rocks of Saxony no less than 60 species of fossil
plants have been met with. Two or three of these, as <i>Calamites
gigas, Sphenopteris erosa,</i> and <i>S. lobata,</i> are also met
with in the government of Perm in Russia. Seven others, and among
them <i>Neuropteris Loshii, Pecopteris arborescens,</i> and <i>P.
similis,</i> and several species of <i>Walchia</i> (see Fig. 426),
a genus of Conifers, called <i>Lycopodites</i> by some authors, are
said by Geinitz to be common to the coal-measures.</p>

<img src="images3/fig428.jpg" width="134" height="336" alt=
"Fig. 428: Noeggerathia cuneifolia." align="right"> 

<p>Among the genera also enumerated by Colonel Gutbier are the
fruit called <i>Cardiocarpon</i> (see Fig. 427), <i>
Asterophyllites,</i> and Annularia, so characteristic of the
Carboniferous period; also <i>Lepidodendron,</i> which is common to
the Permian of Saxony, Thuringia, and Russia, although not
abundant. <i>Neoggerathia</i> (see Fig. 428), the leaves of which
have parallel veins without a midrib, and to which various generic
synonyms, such as <i>Cordaites, Flabellaria,</i> and <i>
Poacites,</i> have been given, is another link between the Permian
and Carboniferous vegetation. Conifer&aelig;, of the Araucarian
division, also occur; but these are likewise met with both in older
and newer rocks. The plants called <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>
Stigmaria,</i> so marked a feature in the Carboniferous period, are
as yet wanting in the true Permian.</p>

<p>Among the remarkable fossils of the Rothliegendes, or lowest
part of the Permian in Saxony and Bohemia, are the silicified
trunks of tree-ferns called generically <i>Psaronius.</i> Their
bark was surrounded by a dense mass of air-roots, which often
constituted a great addition to the original stem, so as to double
or quadruple its diameter. The same remark holds good in regard to
certain living extra-tropical arborescent ferns, particularly those
of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it is evident that the Permian plants approach
much nearer to the Carboniferous flora than to the Triassic; and
the same may be said of the Permian fauna.</p>
