<p>Having in the former part of this work referred the sedimentary
strata to a long succession of geological periods, we have now to
consider how far the volcanic formations can be classed in a
similar chronological order. The tests of relative age in this
class of rocks are four: first, superposition and intrusion, with
or without alteration of the rocks in contact; second, organic
remains; third, mineral characters; fourth, included fragments of
older rocks.</p>

<p>Besides these four tests it may be said, in a general way, that
volcanic rocks of Primary or Pal&aelig;ozoic antiquity differ from
those of the Secondary or Mesozoic age, and these again from the
Tertiary and Recent. Not, perhaps, that they differed originally in
a greater degree than the modern volcanic rocks of one region, such
as that of the Andes, differ from those of another, such as
Iceland, but because all rocks permeated by water, especially if
its temperature be high, are liable to undergo a slow
transmutation, even when they do not assume a new crystalline form
like that of the hypogene rocks.</p>

<p>Although suba&euml;rial and submarine denudation, as before
stated, remove, in the course of ages, large portions of the upper
or more superficial products of volcanoes, yet these are sometimes
preserved by subsidence, becoming covered by the sea or by
superimposed marine deposits. In this way they may be protected for
ages from the waves of the sea, or the destroying action of rivers,
while, at the same time, they may not sink so deep as to be exposed
to that Plutonic action (to be spoken of in Chapter XXXI) which
would convert them into crystalline rocks. But even in this case
they will not remain unaltered, because they will be percolated by
water often of high temperature, and charged with</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 521">[ 521 ]</a></p>

<p>carbonate of lime, silex, iron, and other mineral ingredients,
whereby gradual changes in the constitution of the rocks may be
superinduced. Every geologist is aware how often silicified trees
occur in volcanic tuffs, the perfect preservation of their internal
structure showing that they have not decayed before the petrifying
material was supplied.</p>

<p>The porous and vesicular nature of a large part, both of the
basaltic and trachytic lavas, affords cavities in which silex and
carbonate of lime are readily deposited. Minerals of the zeolite
family, the composition of which has already been alluded to, <a
href="ch28.html#page 500">p. 500</a>, occur in amygdaloids and
other trap-rocks in great abundance, and Daubr&eacute;e&rsquo;s
observations have proved that they are not always simple deposits
of substances held in solution by the percolating waters, being
occasionally products of the chemical action of that water on the
rock through which they are filtered, and portions of which are
decomposed. From these considerations it follows that the perfect
identity of very ancient and very modern volcanic formations is
scarcely possible.</p>

</center>

<p><b>Tests by Superposition.</b>&mdash;If a volcanic rock rest
upon an aqueous deposit, the volcanic must be the newest of the
two; but the like rule does not hold good where the aqueous
formation rests upon the volcanic, for melted matter, rising from
below, may penetrate a sedimentary mass without reaching the
surface, or may be forced in conformably between two strata, as <i>
b</i> below D in Fig. 597, after which it may cool down and
consolidate. Superposition, therefore, is not of the same value as
a test of age in the unstratified volcanic rocks as in
fossiliferous formations. We can only rely implicitly on this test
where the volcanic rocks are contemporaneous, not where they are
intrusive. Now, they are said to be contemporaneous if produced by
volcanic action which was going on simultaneously with the
deposition of the strata with which they are associated. Thus in
the section at D (Fig. 597), we may perhaps ascertain that the trap
<i>b</i> flowed over the fossiliferous bed <i>c,</i> and that,
after its consolidation, <i>a</i> was deposited upon it, <i>a</i>
and <i>c</i> both belonging to the same geological period. But, on
the other hand, we must conclude the trap to be intrusive, if the
stratum <i>a</i> be altered by <i>b</i> at the point of
contact,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 522">[ 522 ]</a></p>

<p>or if, in pursuing <i>b</i> for some distance, we find at length
that it cuts through the stratum <i>a,</i> and then overlies it as
at E.</p>

<img src="images5/fig598.jpg" width="168" height="106" alt=
"Fig. 598: Section through sedimentary mass with melted matter."
align="left"> 

<p>We may, however, be easily deceived in supposing the volcanic
rock to be intrusive, when in reality it is contemporaneous; for a
sheet of lava, as it spreads over the bottom of the sea, can not
rest everywhere upon the same stratum, either because these have
been denuded, or because, if newly thrown down, they thin out in
certain places, thus allowing the lava to cross their edges.
Besides, the heavy igneous fluid will often, as it moves along, cut
a channel into beds of soft mud and sand. Suppose the submarine
lava F (Fig. 598) to have come in contact in this manner with the
strata <i>a, b, c,</i> and that after its consolidation the strata
<i>d, e</i> are thrown down in a nearly horizontal position, yet so
as to lie unconformably to F, the appearance of subsequent
intrusion will here be complete, although the trap is in fact
contemporaneous. We must not, therefore, hastily infer that the
rock F is intrusive, unless we find the overlying strata, <i>d,
e,</i> to have been altered at their junction, as if by heat.</p>

<p>The test of age by superposition is strictly applicable to all
stratified volcanic tuffs, according to the rules already explained
in the case of sedimentary deposits (see <a href=
"ch8.html#page 124">p. 124</a>).</p>

<p><b>Test of Age by Organic Remains.</b>&mdash;We have seen how,
in the vicinity of active volcanoes, scori&aelig;, pumice, fine
sand, and fragments of rock are thrown up into the air, and then
showered down upon the land, or into neighbouring lakes or seas. In
the tuffs so formed shells, corals, or any other durable organic
bodies which may happen to be strewed over the bottom of a lake or
sea will be imbedded, and thus continue as permanent memorials of
the geological period when the volcanic eruption occurred.
Tufaceous strata thus formed in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius,
Etna, Stromboli, and other volcanoes now in islands or near the
sea, may give information of the relative age of these tuffs at
some remote future period when the fires of these mountains are
extinguished. By evidence of this kind we can establish a
coincidence in age between volcanic rocks and the different
primary, secondary, and tertiary fossiliferous strata.</p>

<p>The tuffs alluded to may not always be marine, but may include,
in some places, fresh-water shells; in others, the bones of
terrestrial quadrupeds. The diversity of organic remains in
formations of this nature is perfectly intelligible,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 523">[ 523 ]</a></p>

<p>if we reflect on the wide dispersion of ejected matter during
late eruptions, such as that of the volcano of Coseguina, in the
province of Nicaragua, January 19, 1835. Hot cinders and fine
scori&aelig; were then cast up to a vast height, and covered the
ground as they fell to the depth of more than ten feet, for a
distance of eight leagues from the crater, in a southerly
direction. Birds, cattle, and wild animals were scorched to death
in great numbers, and buried in ashes. Some volcanic dust fell at
Chiapa, upward of 1200 miles, not to leeward of the volcano, as
might have been anticipated, but to windward, a striking proof of a
counter-current in the upper region of the atmosphere; and some on
Jamaica, about 700 miles distant to the north-east. In the sea,
also, at the distance of 1100 miles from the point of eruption,
Captain Eden of the &ldquo;Conway&rdquo; sailed 40 miles through
floating pumice, among which were some pieces of considerable
size.*</p>

<p><b>Test of Age by Mineral Composition.</b>&mdash;As sediment of
homogeneous composition, when discharged from the mouth of a large
river, is often deposited simultaneously over a wide space, so a
particular kind of lava flowing from a crater during one eruption
may spread over an extensive area; thus in Iceland, in 1783, the
melted matter, pouring from Skaptar Jokul, flowed in streams in
opposite directions, and caused a continuous mass the extreme
points of which were 90 miles distant from each other. This
enormous current of lava varied in thickness from 100 feet to 600
feet, and in breadth from that of a narrow river gorge to 15
miles.&dagger; Now, if such a mass should afterwards be divided
into separate fragments by denudation, we might still, perhaps,
identify the detached portions by their similarity in mineral
composition. Nevertheless, this test will not always avail the
geologist; for, although there is usually a prevailing character in
lava emitted during the same eruption, and even in the successive
currents flowing from the same volcano, still, in many cases, the
different parts even of one lava-stream, or, as before stated, of
one continuous mass of trap, vary much in mineral composition and
texture.</p>

<p>In Auvergne, the Eifel, and other countries where trachyte and
basalt are both present, the trachytic rocks are for the most part
older than the basaltic. These rocks do, indeed, sometimes
alternate partially, as in the volcano of Mont Dor, in Auvergne;
and in Madeira trachytic rocks overlie an older basaltic series;
but the trachyte occupies more generally an inferior position, and
is cut through and overflowed by</p>

<p class="fnote">* Caldcleugh, Phil. Trans., 1836, p. 27.<br>
&dagger; See Principles, <i>Index,</i> &ldquo;Skaptar
Jokul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 524">[ 524 ]</a></p>

<p>basalt. It can by no means be inferred that trachyte
predominated at one period of the earth&rsquo;s history and basalt
at another, for we know that trachytic lavas have been formed at
many successive periods, and are still emitted from many active
craters; but it seems that in each region, where a long series of
eruptions have occurred, the lavas containing feldspar more rich in
silica have been first emitted, and the escape of the more augitic
kinds has followed. The hypothesis suggested by Mr. Scrope may,
perhaps, afford a solution of this problem. The minerals, he
observes, which abound in basalt are of greater specific gravity
than those composing the feldspathic lavas; thus, for example,
hornblende, augite, and olivine are each more than three times the
weight of water; whereas common feldspar and albite have each
scarcely more than 2&frac12; times the specific gravity of water;
and the difference is increased in consequence of there being much
more iron in a metallic state in basalt and greenstone than in
trachyte and other allied feldspathic lavas. If, therefore, a large
quantity of rock be melted up in the bowels of the earth by
volcanic heat, the denser ingredients of the boiling fluid may sink
to the bottom, and the lighter remaining above would in that case
be first propelled upward to the surface by the expansive power of
gases. Those materials, therefore, which occupy the lowest place in
the subterranean reservoir will always be emitted last, and take
the uppermost place on the exterior of the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p><b>Test by Included Fragments.</b>&mdash;We may sometimes
discover the relative age of two trap-rocks, or of an aqueous
deposit and the trap on which it rests, by finding fragments of one
included in the other in cases such as those before alluded to,
where the evidence of superposition alone would be insufficient. It
is also not uncommon to find a conglomerate almost exclusively
composed of rolled pebbles of trap, associated with some
fossiliferous stratified formation in the neighbourhood of massive
trap. If the pebbles agree generally in mineral character with the
latter, we are then enabled to determine its relative age by
knowing that of the fossiliferous strata associated with the
conglomerate. The origin of such conglomerates is explained by
observing the shingle beaches composed of trap-pebbles in modern
volcanoes, as at the base of Etna.</p>

<p><b>Recent and Post-pliocene Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;I shall
now select examples of contemporaneous volcanic rocks of successive
geological periods, to show that igneous causes have been in
activity in all past ages of the world. They have been perpetually
shifting the places where they have broken out</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 525">[ 525 ]</a></p>

<p>at the earth&rsquo;s surface, and we can sometimes prove that
those areas which are now the great theatres of volcanic action
were in a state of perfect tranquillity at remote geological
epochs, and that, on the other hand, in places where at former
periods the most violent eruptions took place at the surface and
continued for a great length of time, there has been an entire
suspension of igneous action in historical times, and even, as in
the British Isles, throughout a large part of the antecedent
Tertiary Period.</p>

<p>In the absence of British examples of volcanic rocks newer than
the Upper Miocene, I may state that in other parts of the world,
especially in those where volcanic eruptions are now taking place
from time to time, there are tuffs and lavas belonging to that part
of the Tertiary era the antiquity of which is proved by the
presence of the bones of extinct quadrupeds which co-existed with
terrestrial, fresh-water, and marine mollusca of species still
living. One portion of the lavas, tuffs, and trap-dikes of Etna,
Vesuvius, and the island of Ischia has been produced within the
historical era; another and a far more considerable part originated
at times immediately antecedent, when the waters of the
Mediterranean were already inhabited by the existing testacea, but
when certain species of elephant, rhinoceros, and other quadrupeds
now extinct, inhabited Europe.</p>

<p><i>Vesuvius.</i>&mdash;I have traced in the &ldquo;Principles of
Geology&rdquo; the history of the changes which the volcanic region
of Campania is known to have undergone during the last 2000 years.
The aggregate effect of igneous operations during that period is
far from insignificant, comprising as it does the formation of the
modern cone of Vesuvius since the year 79, and the production of
several minor cones in Ischia, together with that of Monte Nuovo in
the year 1538. Lava-currents have also flowed upon the land and
along the bottom of the sea&mdash;volcanic sand, pumice, and
scori&aelig; have been showered down so abundantly that whole
cities were buried&mdash;tracts of the sea have been filled up or
converted into shoals&mdash;and tufaceous sediment has been
transported by rivers and land-floods to the sea. There are also
proofs, during the same recent period, of a permanent alteration of
the relative levels of the land and sea in several places, and of
the same tract having, near Puzzuoli, been alternately upheaved and
depressed to the amount of more than twenty feet. In connection
with these convulsions, there are found, on the shores of the Bay
of Bai&aelig;, recent tufaceous strata, filled with articles
fabricated by the hands of man, and mingled with marine shells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 526">[ 526 ]</a></p>

<p>It has also been stated (<a href="ch13.html#page 206">p.
206</a>), that when we examine this same region, it is found to
consist largely of tufaceous strata, of a date anterior to human
history or tradition, which are of such thickness as to constitute
hills from 500 to more than 2000 feet in height. Some of these
strata contain marine shells which are exclusively of living
species, others contain a slight mixture, one or two per cent of
species not known as living.</p>

<p>The ancient part of Vesuvius is called Somma, and consists of
the remains of an older cone which appears to have been partly
destroyed by explosion. In the great escarpment which this remnant
of the ancient mountain presents towards the modern cone of
Vesuvius, there are many dikes which are for the most part
vertical, and traverse the inclined beds of lava and scori&aelig;
which were successively superimposed during those eruptions by
which the old cone was formed. They project in relief several
inches, or sometimes feet, from the face of the cliff, being
extremely compact, and less destructible than the intersected tuffs
and porous lavas. In vertical extent they vary from a few yards to
500 feet, and in breadth from one to twelve feet. Many of them cut
all the inclined beds in the escarpment of Somma from top to
bottom, others stop short before they ascend above halfway. In
mineral composition they scarcely differ from the lavas of Somma,
the rock consisting of a base of leucite and augite, through which
large crystals of augite and some of leucite are scattered.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable than the usual parallelism of the
opposite sides of the dikes, which correspond almost as regularly
as the two opposite faces of a wall of masonry. This character
appears at first the more inexplicable, when we consider how jagged
and uneven are the rents caused by earthquakes in masses of
heterogeneous composition, like those composing the cone of Somma.
In explanation of this phenomenon, M. Necker refers us to Sir W.
Hamilton&rsquo;s account of an eruption of Vesuvius in the year
1779, who records the following fact: &ldquo;The lavas, when they
either boiled over the crater, or broke out from the conical parts
of the volcano, constantly formed channels as regular as if they
had been cut by art down the steep part of the mountain; and whilst
in a state of perfect fusion, continued their course in those
channels, which were sometimes full to the brim, and at other times
more or less so, according to the quantity of matter in motion.</p>

<p>&rdquo;These channels (says the same observer), I have found,
upon examination after an eruption, to be in general from</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 527">[ 527 ]</a></p>

<p>two to five or six feet wide, and seven or eight feet deep. They
were often hid from the sight by a quantity of scori&aelig; that
had formed a crust over them; and the lava, having been conveyed in
a covered way for some yards, came out fresh again into an open
channel. After an eruption, I have walked in some of those
subterraneous or covered galleries, which were exceedingly curious,
the sides, top, and bottom <i>being worn perfectly smooth and
even</i> in most parts by the violence of the currents of the
red-hot lavas which they had conveyed for many weeks
successively.&rdquo; I was able to verify this phenomenon in 1858,
when a stream of lava issued from a lateral cone.* Now, the walls
of a vertical fissure, through which lava has ascended in its way
to a volcanic vent, must have been exposed to the same erosion as
the sides of the channels before adverted to. The prolonged and
uniform friction of the heavy fluid, as it is forced and made to
flow upward, can not fail to wear and smooth down the surfaces on
which it rubs, and the intense heat must melt all such masses as
project and obstruct the passage of the incandescent fluid.</p>

<p>The rock composing the dikes both in the modern and ancient part
of Vesuvius is far more compact than that of ordinary lava, for the
pressure of a column of melted matter in a fissure greatly exceeds
that in an ordinary stream of lava; and pressure checks the
expansion of those gases which give rise to vesicles in lava. There
is a tendency in almost all the Vesuvian dikes to divide into
horizontal prisms, a phenomenon in accordance with the formation of
vertical columns in horizontal beds of lava; for in both cases the
divisions which give rise to the prismatic structure are at right
angles to the cooling surfaces. (See <a href="ch28.html#page 510">
p. 510</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Auvergne.</i>&mdash;Although the latest eruptions in central
France seem to have long preceded the historical era, they are so
modern as to have a very intimate connection with the present
superficial outline of the country and with the existing valleys
and river-courses. Among a great number of cones with perfect
craters, one called the Puy de Tartaret sent forth a lava-current
which can be traced up to its crater, and which flowed for a
distance of thirteen miles along the bottom of the present valley
to the village of Nechers, covering the alluvium of the old valley
in which were preserved the bones of an extinct species of horse,
and of a lagomys and other quadrupeds all closely allied to recent
animals, while the associated land-shells were of species now
living, such as <i>Cyclostoma elegans, Helix hortensis, H.
nemoralis,</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* Principles of Geology, vol. i, p. 626.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 528">[ 528 ]</a></p>

<p><i>H. lapicida,</i> and <i>Clausilia rugosa.</i> That the
current which has issued from the Puy de Tartaret may,
nevertheless, be very ancient in reference to the events of human
history, we may conclude, not only from the divergence of the
mammiferous fauna from that of our day, but from the fact that a
Roman bridge of such form and construction as continued in use only
down to the fifth century, but which may be older, is now seen at a
place about a mile and a half from St. Nectaire. This ancient
bridge spans the river Couze with two arches, each about fourteen
feet wide. These arches spring from the lava of Tartaret, on both
banks, showing that a ravine precisely like that now existing had
already been excavated by the river through that lava thirteen or
fourteen centuries ago.</p>

<p>While the river Couze has in most cases, as at the site of this
ancient bridge, been simply able to cut a deep channel through the
lava, the lower portion of which is shown to be columnar, the same
torrent has in other places, where the valley was contracted to a
narrow gorge, had power to remove the entire mass of basaltic rock,
causing for a short space a complete breach of continuity in the
volcanic current. The work of erosion has been very slow, as the
basalt is tough and hard, and one column after another must have
been undermined and reduced to pebbles, and then to sand. During
the time required for this operation, the perishable cone of
Tartaret, occupying the lowest part of the great valley descending
from Mont Dor (see <a href="ch30.html#page 542">p. 542</a>), and
damming up the river so as to cause the Lake of Chambon, has stood
uninjured, proving that no great flood or deluge can have passed
over this region in the interval between the eruption of Tartaret
and our own times.</p>

<p><i>Puy de C&ocirc;me.</i>&mdash;The Puy de C&ocirc;me and its
lava-current, near Clermont, may be mentioned as another minor
volcano of about the same age. This conical hill rises from the
granitic platform, at an angle of between 30&deg; and 40&deg;, to
the height of more than 900 feet. Its summit presents two distinct
craters, one of them with a vertical depth of 250 feet. A stream of
lava takes its rise at the western base of the hill instead of
issuing from either crater, and descends the granitic slope towards
the present site of the town of Pont Gibaud. Thence it pours in a
broad sheet down a steep declivity into the valley of the Sioule,
filling the ancient river-channel for the distance of more than a
mile. The Sioule, thus dispossessed of its bed, has worked out a
fresh one between the lava and the granite of its western bank; and
the excavation</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 529">[ 529 ]</a></p>

<p>has disclosed, in one spot, a wall of columnar basalt about
fifty feet high.*</p>

<p>The excavation of the ravine is still in progress, every winter
some columns of basalt being undermined and carried down the
channel of the river, and in the course of a few miles rolled to
sand and pebbles. Meanwhile the cone of C&ocirc;me remains
unimpaired, its loose materials being protected by a dense
vegetation, and the hill standing on a ridge not commanded by any
higher ground, so that no floods of rain-water can descend upon it.
There is no end to the waste which the hard basalt may undergo in
future, if the physical geography of the country continue
unchanged&mdash;no limit to the number of years during which the
heap of incoherent and transportable materials called the Puy de
C&ocirc;me may remain in an almost stationary condition.</p>

<p><i>Puy de Pariou.</i>&mdash;The brim of the crater of the Puy de
Pariou, near Clermont, is so sharp, and has been so little blunted
by time, that it scarcely affords room to stand upon. This and
other cones in an equally remarkable state of integrity have stood,
I conceive, uninjured, not <i>in spite</i> of their loose porous
nature, as might at first be naturally supposed, but in consequence
of it. No rills can collect where all the rain is instantly
absorbed by the sand and scori&aelig;, as is remarkably the case on
Etna; and nothing but a water-spout breaking directly upon the Puy
de Pariou could carry away a portion of the hill, so long as it is
not rent or ingulfed by earthquakes.</p>

<p><b>Newer Pliocene Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The more ancient
portion of Vesuvius and Etna originated at the close of the Newer
Pliocene period, when less than ten, sometimes only one, in a
hundred of the shells differed from those now living. In the case
of Etna, it was before stated (<a href="ch13.html#page 205">p.
205</a>) that Post-pliocene formations occur in the neighbourhood
of Catania, while the oldest lavas of the great volcano are
Pliocene. These last are seen associated with sedimentary deposits
at Trezza and other places on the southern and eastern flanks of
the great cone (see <a href="ch13.html#page 205">p. 205</a>).</p>

<p><i>Cyclopean Islands.</i>&mdash;The Cyclopean Islands, called by
the Sicilians Dei Faraglioni, in the sea-cliffs of which these beds
of clay, tuff, and associated lava are laid open to view, are
situated in the Bay of Trezza, and may be regarded as the extremity
of a promontory severed from the main land. Here numerous proofs
are seen of submarine eruptions, by which the argillaceous and
sandy strata were invaded and cut through, and tufaceous breccias
formed. Inclosed in</p>

<p class="fnote">* Scrope&rsquo;s Central France, p. 60, and
plate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 530">[ 530 ]</a></p>

<p>these breccias are many angular and hardened fragments of
laminated clay in different states of alteration by heat, and

<p>The loftiest of the Cyclopean islets, or rather rocks, is about
200 feet in height, the summit being formed of a mass of stratified
clay, the lamin&aelig; of which are occasionally subdivided by thin
arenaceous layers. These strata dip to the N.W., and rest on a mass
of columnar lava (see Fig. 599) in which the tops of the pillars
are weathered, and so rounded as to be often hemispherical.</p>

<p>In some places in the adjoining and largest islet of the group,
which lies to the north-eastward of that represented in Figure
599), the overlying clay has been greatly altered and hardened by
the igneous rock, and occasionally contorted in the most
extraordinary manner; yet the lamination has not been obliterated,
but, on the contrary, rendered much more conspicuous, by the
indurating process.</p>

<p>In Fig. 600 I have represented a portion of the altered rock, a
few feet square, where the alternating thin lamin&aelig; of sand
and clay are contorted in a manner often observed in ancient
metamorphic schists. A great fissure, running</p>

<p>from east to west, nearly divides this larger island into two
parts, and lays open its internal structure. In the section thus
exhibited, a dike of lava is seen, first cutting through an older
mass of lava, and then penetrating the superincumbent tertiary
strata. In one place the lava ramifies and terminates in thin
veins, from a few feet to a few inches in thickness (see Fig. 601).
The arenaceous lamin&aelig; are much hardened at the point of
contact, and the clays are converted into siliceous schist. In this
island the altered rocks assume a honey-comb structure on their
weathered surface, singularly contrasted with the smooth and even
outline which the same beds present in their usual soft and
yielding state. The pores of the lava are sometimes coated, or
entirely filled with carbonate of lime, and with a zeolite
resembling analcime, which has been called cyclopite. The latter
mineral has also been found in small fissures traversing the
altered marl, showing that the same cause which introduced the
minerals into the cavities of the lava, whether we suppose
sublimation or aqueous infiltration, conveyed it also into the open
rents of the contiguous sedimentary strata.</p>

<p><i>Dikes of Palagonia.</i>&mdash;Dikes of vesicular and
amygdaloidal lava are also seen traversing marine tuff or peperino,
west of Palagonia, some of the pores of the lava being empty, while
others are filled with carbonate of lime. In such cases we may
suppose the tuff to have resulted from showers of volcanic sand and
scori&aelig;, together with fragments of limestone, thrown out by a
submarine explosion, similar to that which gave rise to Graham
Island in 1831. When the mass was, to a certain degree,
consolidated, it may have been rent open, so that the lava ascended
through fissures, the walls of which were perfectly even and
parallel. In one case, after the melted matter that filled the rent
(Fig. 602) had cooled down, it must have been fractured and shifted
horizontally by a lateral movement.</p>

<p>In Fig. 603, the lava has more the appearance of a vein, which
forced its way through the peperino. It is highly probable that
similar appearances would be seen, if we could examine the floor of
the sea in that part</p>

<p>of the Mediterranean where the waves have recently washed away
the new volcanic island; for when a superincumbent mass of ejected
fragments has been removed by denudation, we may expect to see
sections of dikes traversing tuff, or, in other words, sections of
the channels of communication by which the subterranean lavas
reached the surface.</p>

<p><i>Madeira.</i>&mdash;Although the more ancient portion of the
volcanic eruptions by which the island of Madeira and the
neighbouring one of Porto Santo were built up occurred, as we shall
presently see, in the Upper Miocene Period, a still larger part of
the island is of Pliocene date. That the latest outbreaks belonged
to the Newer Pliocene Period, I infer from the close affinity to
the present flora of Madeira of the fossil plants preserved in a
leaf-bed in the north-eastern part of the island. These fossils,
associated with some lignite in the ravine of the river San Jorge,
can none of them be proved to be of extinct species, but their
antiquity may be inferred from the following considerations:
Firstly&mdash;The leaf-bed, discovered by Mr. Hartung and myself in
1853, at the height of 1000 feet above the level of the sea, crops
out at the base of a cliff formed by the erosion of a gorge cut
through alternating layers of basalt and scori&aelig;, the product
of a vast succession of eruptions of unknown date, piled up to a
thickness of 1000 feet, and which were all poured out after the
plants, of which about twenty species have been recognised,
flourished in Madeira. These lavas are inclined at an angle of
about 15&deg; to the north, and came down from the great central
region of eruption. Their accumulation implies a long period of
intermittent volcanic action, subsequently to which the ravine of
San Jorge was hollowed out. Secondly&mdash;Some few of the plants,
though perhaps all of living species, are supposed to be of genera
not now existing in the island. They have been described by Sir
Charles Bunbury and Professor Heer, and the former first pointed
out that many of the leaves are of the laurel type, and analogous
to those now flourishing in the modern forests of Madeira. He also
recognised among them the leaves of <i>Woodwardia radicans,</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 532">[ 532 ]</a></p>

<p>and <i>Davallia Canariensis,</i> ferns now abundant in Madeira.
Thirdly&mdash;the great age of this leaf-bed of San Jorge, which
was perhaps originally formed in the crater of some ancient
volcanic cone afterwards buried under lava, is proved by its
belonging to a part of the eastern extremity of Madeira, which,
after the close of the igneous eruptions, became covered in the
adjoining district of Cani&ccedil;al with blown sand in which a
vast number of land-shells were buried. These fossil shells
belonged to no less than 36 species, among which are many now
extremely rare in the island, and others, about five per cent,
extinct or unknown in any part of the world. Several of these of
the genus <i>Helix</i> are conspicuous from the peculiarity of
their forms, others from their large dimensions. The geographical
configuration of the country shows that this shell-bed is
considerably more modern than the leaf-bed; it must therefore be
referred to the Newer Pliocene, according to the definition of this
period given in a former chapter (<a href="ch9.html#page 143">p.
143</a>).</p>

<p><b>Older Pliocene Period.</b>&mdash;<i>Italy.</i>&mdash;In
Tuscany, as at Radicofani, Viterbo, and Aquapendente, and in the
Campagna di Roma, submarine volcanic tuffs are interstratified with
the Older Pliocene strata of the Sub-apennine hills in such a
manner as to leave no doubt that they were the products of
eruptions which occurred when the shelly marls and sands of the
Sub-appenine hills were in the course of deposition. This opinion I
expressed* after my visit to Italy in 1828 and it has recently
(1850) been confirmed by the argument adduced by Sir R. Murchison
in favour of the submarine origin of the tertiary volcanic rocks of
Italy.&dagger; These rocks are well-known to rest conformably on
the Sub-apennine marls, even as far south as Monte Mario, in the
suburbs of Rome. On the exact age of the deposits of Monte Mario
new light has recently been thrown by a careful study of their
marine fossil shells, undertaken by MM. Rayneval, Van den Hecke,
and Ponzi. They have compared no less than 160 species with the
shells of the Coralline Crag of Suffolk, so well described by Mr.
Searles Wood; and the specific agreement between the British and
Italian fossils is so great, if we make due allowance for
geographical distance and the difference of latitude, that we can
have little hesitation in referring both to the same period, or to
the Older Pliocene of this work. It is highly probable that,
between the oldest trachytes of Tuscany and the newest rocks in the
neighbourhood of Naples, a</p>

<p>series of volcanic products might be detected of every age from
the Older Pliocene to the historical epoch.</p>

<p><i>Pliocene Volcanoes of the Eifel.</i>&mdash;Some of the most
perfect cones and craters in Europe, not even excepting those of
the district round Vesuvius, may be seen on the left or west bank
of the Rhine, near Bonn and Andernach. They exhibit characters
distinct from any which I have observed elsewhere, owing to the
large part which the escape of aqueous vapour has played in the
eruptions and the small quantities of lava emitted. The fundamental
rocks of the district are grey and red sandstones and shales, with
some associated limestones, replete with fossils of the Devonian or
Old Red Sandstone group. The volcanoes broke out in the midst of
these inclined strata, and when the present systems of hills and
valleys had already been formed. The eruptions occurred sometimes
at the bottom of deep valleys, sometimes on the summit of hills,
and frequently on intervening platforms. In travelling through this
district we often come upon them most unexpectedly, and may find
ourselves on the very edge of a crater before we had been led to
suspect that we were approaching the site of any igneous outburst.
Thus, for example, on arriving at the village of Gemund,
immediately south of Daun, we leave the stream, which flows at the
bottom of a deep valley in which strata of sandstone and shale crop
out. We then climb a steep hill, on the surface of which we see the
edges of the same strata dipping inward towards the mountain. When
we have ascended to a considerable height, we see fragments of
scori&aelig; sparingly scattered over the surface; until at length,
on reaching the summit, we find ourselves suddenly on the edge of a
<i>tarn,</i> or deep circular lake-basin called the Gemunder Maar.
In it we recognise the ordinary form of a crater, for which we have
been prepared by the occurrence of scori&aelig; scattered over the
surface of the soil. But on examining the walls of the crater we
find precipices of sandstone and shale which exhibit no signs of
the action of heat; and we look in vain for those beds of lava and
scori&aelig;, dipping outward on every side, which we have been
accustomed to consider as characteristic of volcanic vents. As we
proceed, however, to the opposite side of the lake, we find a
considerable quantity of scori&aelig; and some lava, and see the
whole surface of the soil sparkling with volcanic sand, and strewed
with ejected fragments of half-fused shale, which preserves its
laminated texture in the interior, while it has a vitrified or
scoriform coating.</p>

<p>Other crater lakes of circular or oval form, and hollowed out of
similar ancient strata, occur in the Upper Eifel, where</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 535">[ 535 ]</a></p>

<p>copious a&euml;riform discharges have taken place, throwing out
vast heaps of pulverized shale into the air. I know of no other
extinct volcanoes where gaseous explosions of such magnitude have
been attended by the emission of so small a quantity of lava. Yet I
looked in vain in the Eifel for any appearances which could lend
support to the hypothesis that the sudden rushing out of such
enormous volumes of gas had ever lifted up the stratified rocks
immediately around the vent so as to form conical masses, having
their strata dipping outward on all sides from a central axis, as
is assumed in the theory of elevation craters, alluded to in the
last chapter.</p>

<p>I have already given (<a href="images4/fig590.jpg">Fig. 590</a>)
an example in the Eifel of a small stream of lava which issued from
one of the craters of that district at Bertrich-Baden. It shows
that when some of these volcanoes were in action the valleys had
already been eroded to their present depth.</p>

<p><i>Trass.</i>&mdash;The tufaceous alluvium called <i>trass,</i>
which has covered large areas in the Eifel, and choked up some
valleys now partially re-excavated, is unstratified. Its base
consists almost entirely of pumice, in which are included fragments
of basalt and other lavas, pieces of burnt shale, slate, and
sandstone, and numerous trunks and branches of trees. If, as is
probable, this trass was formed during the period of volcanic
eruptions, it may have originated in the manner of the moya of the
Andes.</p>

<p>We may easily conceive that a similar mass might now be
produced, if a copious evolution of gases should occur in one of
the lake-basins. If a breach should be made in the side of the
cone, the flood would sweep away great heaps of ejected fragments
of shale and sandstone, which would be borne down into the
adjoining valleys. Forests might be torn up by such a flood, and
thus the occurrence of the numerous trunks of trees dispersed
irregularly through the trass can be explained. The manner in which
this trass conforms to the shape of the present valleys implies its
comparatively modern origin, probably not dating farther back than
the Pliocene Period.</p>
