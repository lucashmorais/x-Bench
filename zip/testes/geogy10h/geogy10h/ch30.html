<p><b>Volcanic Rocks of the Upper Miocene
Period.</b>&mdash;<i>Madeira.</i>&mdash;The greater part of the
volcanic eruptions of Madeira, as we have already seen (<a href=
"ch29.html#page 532">p. 532</a>), belong to the Pliocene Period,
but the most ancient of them are of Upper Miocene date, as shown by
the fossil shells included in the marine tuffs which have been
upraised at San Vicente, in the northern part of the island, to the
height of 1300 feet above the level of the sea. A similar marine
and volcanic formation constitutes the fundamental portion of the
neighbouring island of Porto Santo, forty miles distant from
Madeira, and is there elevated to an equal height, and covered, as
in Madeira, with lavas of supra-marine origin.</p>

<p>The largest number of fossils have been collected from the tuffs
and conglomerates and some beds of limestone in the island of
Baixo, off the southern extremity of Porto Santo. They amount in
this single locality to more than sixty in number, of which about
fifty are mollusca, but many of these are only casts. Some of the
shells probably lived on the spot during the intervals between
eruptions, and some may have been cast up into the water or air
together with muddy ejections, and, falling down again, have been
deposited on the bottom of the sea. The hollows in some of the
fragments of vesicular lava of which the breccias and conglomerates
are composed are partially filled with calc-sinter, being thus half
converted into amygdaloids. Among the fossil shells common to
Madeira and Porto Santo, large cones, strombs, and cowries are
conspicuous among the univalves, and <i>Cardium, Spondylus,</i> and
<i>Lithodomus</i> among the lamellibranchiate bivalves, and among
the <i>Echinoderms</i> the large Clypeaster called <i>C. altus,</i>
an extinct European Miocene fossil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 537">[ 537 ]</a></p>

<p>The largest list of fossils has been published by Mr. Karl
Meyer, in Hartung&rsquo;s &ldquo;Madeira;&rdquo; but in the
collection made by myself, and in a still larger one formed by Mr.
J. Yate Johnson, several remarkable forms not in Meyer&rsquo;s list
occur, as, for example, <i>Pholadomya,</i> and a large <i>
Terebra.</i> Mr. Johnson also found a fine specimen of <i>Nautilus
(Atruria) ziczac</i> (<a href="images1/fig207.jpg">Fig. 211</a>), a
well-known Falunian fossil of Europe; and in the same volcanic tuff
of Baixo, the Echinoderm <i>Brissus Scill&aelig;,</i> a living
Mediterranean species, found fossil in the Miocene strata of Malta.
Mr. Meyer identifies one-third of the Madeira shells with known
European Miocene (or Falunian) forms. The huge Strombus of San
Vicente and Porto Santo, <i>S. Italicus,</i> is an extinct shell of
the Sub-apennine or Older Pliocene formations. The mollusca already
obtained from various localities of Madeira and Porto Santo are not
less than one hundred in number, and, according to the late Dr. S.
P. Woodward, rather more than a third are of species still living,
but many of these are not now inhabitants of the neighbouring
sea.</p>

<p>It has been remarked (<a href="ch14.html#page 212">p. 212</a>),
that in the Older Pliocene and Upper Miocene deposits of Europe
many forms occur of a more southern aspect than those now
inhabiting the nearest sea. In like manner the fossil corals, or
Zoantharia, six in number, which I obtained from Madeira, of the
genera <i>Astr&aelig;a, Sarcinula, Hydnophora,</i> were pronounced
by Mr. Lonsdale to be forms foreign to the adjacent coasts, and
agreeing with the fauna of a sea warmer than that now separating
Madeira from the nearest part of the African coast. We learn,
indeed, from the observations made in 1859, by the Reverend R. T.
Lowe, that more than one-half, or fifty-three in ninety, of the
marine mollusks collected by him from the sandy beach of Mogador
are common British species, although Mogador is 18&frac12; degrees
south of the nearest shores of England. The living shells of
Madeira and Porto Santo are in like manner those of a temperate
climate, although in great part differing specifically from those
of Mogador.*</p>

<p><i>Grand Canary.</i>&mdash;In the Canaries, especially in the
Grand Canary, the same marine Upper Miocene formation is found.
Stratified tuffs, with intercalated conglomerates and lavas, are
there seen in nearly horizontal layers in sea-cliffs about 300 feet
high, near Las Palmas. Mr. Hartung and I were unable to find marine
shells in these tuffs at a greater elevation than 400 feet above
the sea; but as the deposit to which they belong reaches to the
height of 1100 feet or more in the interior, we conceive that an
upheaval of at least that amount has</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 538">[ 538 ]</a></p>

<p>taken place. The <i>Clypeaster altus, Spondylus g&aelig;deropus,
Pectunculus pilosus, Cardita calyculata,</i> and several other
shells, serve to identify this formation with that of the Madeiras,
and <i>Ancillaria glandiformis,</i> which is not rare, and some
other fossils, remind us of the faluns of Touraine.</p>

<p>The sixty-two Miocene species which I collected in the Grand
Canary were referred by the late Dr. S. P. Woodward to forty-seven
genera, ten of which are no longer represented in the neighbouring
sea, namely <i>Corbis,</i> an African form, Hinnites, now living in
Oregon, <i>Thecidium</i> (<i>T. Mediterranean,</i> identical with
the Miocene fossil of St. Juvat, in Brittany), <i>Calyptr&aelig;a,
Hipponyx, Nerita, Erato, Oliva, Ancillaria,</i> and <i>
Fasciolaria.</i></p>

<p>These tuffs of the southern shores of the Grand Canary,
containing the Upper Miocene shells, appear to be about the same
age as the most ancient volcanic rocks of the island, composed of
slaty diabase, phonolite, and trachyte. Over the marine lavas and
tuffs trachytic and basaltic products of suba&euml;rial volcanic
origin, between 4000 and 5000 feet in thickness, have been piled,
the central parts of the Grand Canary reaching the height of about
6000 feet above the level of the sea. A large portion of this mass
is of Pliocene date, and some of the latest lavas have been poured
out since the time when the valleys were already excavated to
within a few feet of their present depth.</p>

<p>On the whole, the rocks of the Grand Canary, an island of a
nearly circular shape, and 6&frac12; geographical miles diameter,
exhibit proofs of a long series of eruptions beginning like those
of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Azores, in the Upper Miocene
period, and continued to the Post-Pliocene. The building up of the
Grand Canary by suba&euml;rial eruptions, several thousand feet
thick, went on simultaneously with the gradual upheaval of the
earliest products of submarine eruptions, in the same manner as the
Pliocene marine strata of the oldest parts of Vesuvius and Etna
have been upraised during eruptions of Post-tertiary date.</p>

<p>In proof that movements of elevation have actually continued
down to Post-tertiary times, I may remark that I found raised
beaches containing shells of the Recent Period in the Grand Canary,
Teneriffe, and Porto Santo. The most remarkable raised beach which
I observed in the Grand Canary, in the study of which I was
assisted by Don Pedro Maffiotte, is situated in the north-eastern
part of the island at San Catalina, about a quarter of a mile north
of Las Palmas. It intervenes between the base of the high cliff
formed of the tuffs with Miocene shells and the sea-shore. From</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 539">[ 539 ]</a></p>

<p>this beach, at an elevation of twenty-five feet above high-water
mark, and at a distance of about 150 feet from the present shore, I
obtained more than fifty species of living marine shells. Many of
them, according to Dr. S. P. Woodward, are no longer inhabitants of
the contiguous sea, as, for example, <i>Strombus bubonius,</i>
which is still living on the West Coast of Africa, and <i>Cerithium
procerum,</i> found at Mozambique; others are Mediterranean
species, as <i>Pecten Jacob&aelig;us</i> and <i>P. polymorphus.</i>
Some of these testacea, such as <i>Cardita squamosa,</i> are
inhabitants of deep water, and the deposit on the whole seems to
indicate a depth of water exceeding a hundred feet.</p>

<p><i>Azores.</i>&mdash;In the island of St. Mary&rsquo;s, one of
the Azores, marine fossil shells have long been known. They are
found on the north-east coast on a small projecting promontory
called Ponta do Papagaio (or Point-Parrot), chiefly in a limestone
about twenty feet thick, which rests upon, and is again covered by,
basaltic lavas, scori&aelig;, and conglomerates. The pebbles in the
conglomerate are cemented together with carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartung, in his account of the Azores, published in 1860,
describes twenty-three shells from St. Mary&rsquo;s,* of which
eight perhaps are identical with living species, and twelve are
with more or less certainty referred to European Tertiary forms,
chiefly Upper Miocene. One of the most characteristic and abundant
of the new species, <i>Cardium Hartungi,</i> not known as fossil in
Europe, is very common in Porto Santo and Baixo, and serves to
connect the Miocene fauna of the Azores and the Madeiras. In some
of the Azores, as well as in the Canary islands, the volcanic fires
are not yet extinct, as the recorded eruptions of Lanzerote,
Teneriffe, Palma, St. Michael&rsquo;s, and others, attest.</p>

<p><b>Lower Miocene Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;<i>Isle of Mull and
Antrim.</i>&mdash;I may refer the reader to the account already
given (<a href="ch15.html#page 247">p. 247</a>) of leaf-beds at
Ardtun, in the Isle of Mull in the Hebrides, which bear a relation
to the associated volcanic rocks of Lower Miocene date analogous to
that which the Madeira leaf-bed, above described (<a href=
"ch29.html#page 532">p. 532</a>), bears to the Pliocene lavas of
that island. Mr. Geikie has shown that the volcanic rocks in Mull
are above 3000 feet in thickness. There seems little doubt that the
well-known columnar basalt of Staffa, as well as that of Antrim in
Ireland, are of the same age, and not of higher antiquity, as once
suspected.</p>

<p><i>The Eifel.</i>&mdash;A large portion of the volcanic rocks of
the</p>

<p>Lower Rhine and the Eifel are coeval with the Lower Miocene
deposits to which most of the &ldquo;Brown-Coal&rdquo; of Germany
belongs. The Tertiary strata of that age are seen on both sides of
the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Bonn, resting unconformably on
highly inclined and vertical strata of Silurian and Devonian rocks.
The Brown-Coal formation of that region consists of beds of loose
sand, sandstone, and conglomerate, clay with nodules of
clay-iron-stone, and occasionally silex. Layers of light brown and
sometimes black lignite are interstratified with the clays and
sands, and often irregularly diffused through them. They contain
numerous impressions of leaves and stems of trees, and are
extensively worked for fuel, whence the name of the formation. In
several places layers of trachytic tuff are interstratified, and in
these tuffs are leaves of plants identical with those found in the
brown-coal, showing that, during the period of the accumulation of
the latter, some volcanic products were ejected. The igneous rocks
of the Westerwald, and of the mountains called the Siebengebirge,
consist partly of basaltic and partly of trachytic lavas, the
latter being in general the more ancient of the two. There are many
varieties of trachyte, some of which are highly crystalline,
resembling a coarse-grained granite, with large separate crystals
of feldspar. Trachytic tuff is also very abundant.</p>

<p>M. Von Dechen, in his work on the Siebengebirge,* has given a
copious list of the animal and vegetable remains of the fresh-water
strata associated with the brown-coal of that part of Germany.
Plants of the genera <i>Flabellaria, Ceanothus,</i> and <i>
Daphnogene,</i> including <i>D. cinnamomifolia</i> (<a href=
"images1/fig155.jpg">Fig. 155</a>), occur in these beds, with
nearly 150 other plants. The fishes of the brown-coal near Bonn are
found in a bituminous shale, called paper-coal, from being
divisible into extremely thin leaves. The individuals are very
numerous; but they appear to belong to a small number of species,
some of which were referred by Agassiz to the genera <i>Leuciscus,
Aspius,</i> and <i>Perca.</i> The remains of frogs also, of extinct
species, have been discovered in the paper-coal; and a complete
series may be seen in the museum at Bonn, from the most imperfect
state of the tadpole to that of the full-grown animal. With these a
salamander, scarcely distinguishable from the recent species, has
been found, and the remains of many insects.</p>

<p><b>Upper and Lower Miocene Volcanic Rocks of
Auvergne.</b>&mdash;The extinct volcanoes of Auvergne and Cantal,
in central France, seem to have commenced their eruptions in the
Lower</p>

<p>Miocene period, but to have been most active during the Upper
Miocene and Pliocene eras. I have already alluded to the grand
succession of events of which there is evidence in Auvergne since
the last retreat of the sea (see <a href="ch29.html#page 527">p.
527</a>).</p>

<p>The earliest monuments of the Tertiary Period in that region are
lacustrine deposits of great thickness, in the lowest conglomerates
of which are rounded pebbles of quartz, mica-schist, granite, and
other non-volcanic rocks, without the slightest intermixture of
igneous products. To these conglomerates succeed argillaceous and
calcareous marls and limestones, containing Lower Miocene shells
and bones of mammalia, the higher beds of which sometimes alternate
with volcanic tuff of contemporaneous origin. After the filling up
or drainage of the ancient lakes, huge piles of trachytic and
basaltic rocks, with volcanic breccias, accumulated to a thickness
of several thousand feet, and were superimposed upon granite, or
the contiguous lacustrine strata. The greater portion of these
igneous rocks appear to have originated during the Upper Miocene
and Pliocene periods; and extinct quadrupeds of those eras,
belonging to the genera Mastodon, Rhinoceros, and others, were
buried in ashes and beds of alluvial sand and gravel, which owe
their preservation to overspreading sheets of lava.</p>

<p>In Auvergne, the most ancient and conspicuous of the volcanic
masses is Mont Dor, which rests immediately on the granitic rocks
standing apart from the fresh-water strata. This great mountain
rises suddenly to the height of several thousand feet above the
surrounding platform, and retains the shape of a flattened and
somewhat irregular cone, the slope of which is gradually lost in
the high plain around. This cone is composed of layers of
scori&aelig;, pumice-stones, and their fine detritus, with
interposed beds of trachyte and basalt, which descend often in
uninterrupted sheets until they reach and spread themselves round
the base of the mountain.* Conglomerates, also, composed of angular
and rounded fragments of igneous rocks, are observed to alternate
with the above; and the various masses are seen to dip off from the
central axis, and to lie parallel to the sloping flanks of the
mountain. The summit of Mont Dor terminates in seven or eight rocky
peaks, where no regular crater can now be traced, but where we may
easily imagine one to have existed, which may have been shattered
by earthquakes, and have suffered degradation by aqueous agents.
Originally, perhaps, like the highest crater of Etna, it may have
formed</p>

<p class="fnote">* Scrope&rsquo;s Central France, p. 98.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 542">[ 542 ]</a></p>

<p>an insignificant feature in the great pile, and, like it, may
frequently have been destroyed and renovated.</p>

<p>Respecting the age of the great mass of Mont Dor, we can not
come at present to any positive decision, because no organic
remains have yet been found in the tuffs, except impressions of the
leaves of trees of species not yet determined. It has already been
stated (<a href="ch15.html#page 234">p. 234</a>) that the earliest
eruptions must have been posterior in origin to those grits and
conglomerates of the fresh-water formation of the Limagne which
contain no pebbles of volcanic rocks. But there is evidence at a
few points, as in the hill of Gergovia, presently to be mentioned,
that some eruptions took place before the great lakes were drained,
while others occurred after the desiccation of those lakes, and
when deep valleys had already been excavated through fresh-water
strata.</p>

<p>The valley in which the cone of Tartaret, above-mentioned (<a
href="ch29.html#page 527">p. 527</a>), is situated affords an
impressive monument of the very different dates at which the
igneous eruptions of Auvergne have happened; for while the cone
itself is of Post-Pliocene date, the valley is bounded by lofty
precipices composed of sheets of ancient columnar trachyte and
basalt, which once flowed from the summit of Mont Dor in some part
of the Miocene period. These Miocene lavas had accumulated to a
thickness of nearly 1000 feet before the ravine was cut down to the
level of the river Couze, a river which was at length dammed up by
the modern cone and the upper part of its course transformed into a
lake.</p>

<p><i>Gergovia.</i>&mdash;It has been supposed by some observers
that there is an alternation of a contemporaneous sheet of lava
with fresh-water strata in the hill of Gergovia, near Clermont.</p>

<center><img src="images5/fig604.jpg" width="406" height="237" alt=
"Fig. 604: Hill of Gergovia."></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 543">[ 543 ]</a></p>

<p>But this idea has arisen from the intrusion of the dike
represented in Fig. 604, which has altered the green and white
marls both above and below. Nevertheless, there is a real
alternation of volcanic tuff with strata containing Lower Miocene
fresh-water shells, among others a Melania allied to <i>M.
inquinata</i> (<a href="images1/fig216.jpg">Fig. 217</a>), with a
Melanopsis and a Unio; there can, therefore, be no doubt that in
Auvergne some volcanic explosions took place before the drainage of
the lakes, and at a time when the Lower Miocene species of animals
and plants still flourished.</p>

<p><b>Eocene Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;<i>Monte
Bolca.</i>&mdash;The fissile limestone of Monte Bolca, near Verona,
has for many centuries been celebrated in Italy for the number of
perfect Ichthyolites which it contains. Agassiz has described no
less than 133 species of fossil fish from this single deposit, and
the multitude of individuals by which many of the species are
represented is attested by the variety of specimens treasured up in
the principal museums of Europe. They have been all obtained from
quarries worked exclusively by lovers of natural history, for the
sake of the fossils. Had the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, now
regarded as so rich in fossils, been in like manner quarried solely
for scientific objects, it would have remained almost a sealed book
to pal&aelig;ontologists, so sparsely are the organic remains
scattered through it. When I visited Monte Bolca, in company with
Sir Roderick Murchison, in 1828, we ascertained that the
fish-bearing beds were of Eocene date, containing well-known
species of Nummulites, and that a long series of submarine volcanic
eruptions, evidently contemporaneous, had produced beds of tuff,
which are cut through by dikes of basalt. There is evidence here of
a long series of submarine volcanic eruptions of Eocene date, and
during some of them, as Sir R. Murchison has suggested, shoals of
fish were probably destroyed by the evolution of heat, noxious
gases, and tufaceous mud, just as happened when Graham&rsquo;s
Island was thrown up between Sicily and Africa in 1831, at which
time the waters of the Mediterranean were seen to be charged with
red mud, and covered with dead fish over a wide area.*</p>

<p>Associated with the marls and limestones of Monte Bolca are beds
containing lignite and shale with numerous plants, which have been
described by Unger and Massalongo, and referred by them to the
Eocene period. I have already cited (<a href=
"ch16.html#page 263">p. 263</a>) Professor Heer&rsquo;s remark,
that several of the species are common to Monte Bolca and the white
clay of Alum Bay, a Middle Eocene deposit; and the same botanist
dwells on</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 544">[ 544 ]</a></p>

<p>the tropical character of the flora of Monte Bolca and its
distinctness from the sub-tropical flora of the Lower Miocene of
Switzerland and Italy, in which last there is a far more
considerable mixture of forms of a temperate climate, such as the
willow, poplar, birch, elm, and others. That scarcely any one of
the Monte Bolca fish should have been found in any other locality
in Europe, is a striking illustration of the extreme imperfection
of the pal&aelig;ontological record. We are in the habit of
imagining that our insight into the geology of the Eocene period is
more than usually perfect, and we are certainly acquainted with an
almost unbroken succession of assemblages of shells passing one
into the other from the era of the Thanet sands to that of the
Bembridge beds or Paris gypsum. The general dearth, therefore, of
fish in the different members of the Eocene series, Upper, Middle,
and Lower, might induce a hasty reasoner to conclude that there was
a poverty of ichthyic forms during this period; but when a local
accident, like the volcanic eruptions of Monte Bolca, occurs,
proofs are suddenly revealed to us of the richness and variety of
this great class of vertebrata in the Eocene sea. The number of
genera of Monte Bolca fish is, according to Agassiz, no less than
seventy-five, twenty of them peculiar to that locality, and only
eight common to the antecedent Cretaceous period. No less than
forty-seven out of the seventy-five genera make their appearance
for the first time in the Monte Bolca rocks, none of them having
been met with as yet in the antecedent formations. They form a
great contrast to the fish of the secondary strata, as, with the
exception of the Placoids, they are all Teleosteans, only one
genus, <i>Pycnodus,</i> belonging to the order of Ganoids, which
form, as before stated, the vast majority of the ichthyolites
entombed in the secondary are Mesozoic rocks.</p>

<p><b>Cretaceous Period.</b>&mdash;M. Virlet, in his account of the
geology of the Morea, p. 205, has clearly shown that certain traps
in Greece are of Cretaceous date; as those, for example, which
alternate conformably with cretaceous limestone and greensand
between Kastri and Damala, in the Morea. They consist in great part
of diallage rocks and serpentine, and of an amygdaloid with
calcareous kernels, and a base of serpentine. In certain parts of
the Morea, the age of these volcanic rocks is established by the
following proofs: first, the lithographic limestones of the
Cretaceous era are cut through by trap, and then a conglomerate
occurs, at Nauplia and other places, containing in its calcareous
cement many well-known fossils of the chalk and greensand, together
with pebbles</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 545">[ 545 ]</a></p>

<p>ormed of rolled pieces of the same serpentinous trap, which
appear in the dikes above alluded to.</p>

<p><b>Period of Oolite and Lias.</b>&mdash;Although the green and
serpentinous trap-rocks of the Morea belong chiefly to the
Cretaceous era, as before mentioned, yet it seems that some
eruptions of similar rocks began during the Oolitic period;* and it
is probable that a large part of the trappean masses, called
ophiolites in the Apennines, and associated with the limestone of
that chain, are of corresponding age.</p>

<p><b>Trap of the New Red Sandstone Period.</b>&mdash;In the
southern part of Devonshire, trappean rocks are associated with New
Red Sandstone, and, according to Sir H. De la Beche, have not been
intruded subsequently into the sandstone, but were produced by
contemporaneous volcanic action. Some beds of grit, mingled with
ordinary red marl, resemble sands ejected from a crater; and in the
stratified conglomerates occurring near Tiverton are many angular
fragments of trap porphyry, some of them one or two tons in weight,
intermingled with pebbles of other rocks. These angular fragments
were probably thrown out from volcanic vents, and fell upon
sedimentary matter then in the course of deposition.&dagger;</p>

<p><b>Trap of the Permian Period.</b>&mdash;The recent
investigations of Mr. Archibald Geikie in Ayrshire have shown that
some of the volcanic rocks in that county are of Permian age, and
it appears highly probable that the uppermost portion of
Arthur&rsquo;s Seat in the suburbs of Edinburgh marks the site of
an eruption of the same era.</p>

<p><b>Trap of the Carboniferous Period.</b>&mdash;Two classes of
contemporaneous trap-rocks occur in the coal-field of the Forth, in
Scotland. The newest of these, connected with the higher series of
coal-measures, is well exhibited along the shores of the Forth, in
Fifeshire, where they consist of basalt with olivine, amygdaloid,
greenstone, wacke, and tuff. They appear to have been erupted while
the sedimentary strata were in a horizontal position, and to have
suffered the same dislocations which those strata have subsequently
undergone. In the volcanic tuffs of this age are found not only
fragments of limestone, shale, flinty slate, and sandstone, but
also pieces of coal. The other or older class of carboniferous
traps are traced along the south margin of Stratheden, and
constitute a ridge parallel with the Ochils, and extending from
Stirling to near St. Andrews. They consist almost exclusively of
greenstone, becoming, in a few instances, earthy and amygdaloidal.

<p>sandstone, shale, and iron-stone of the lower coal-measures,
and, on the East Lomond, with Mountain Limestone. I examined these
trap-rocks in 1838, in the cliffs south of St. Andrews, where they
consist in great part of stratified tuffs, which are curved,
vertical, and contorted, like the associated coal-measures. In the
tuff I found fragments of carboniferous shale and limestone, and
intersecting veins of greenstone.</p>

<p><i>Fife&mdash;Flisk Dike.</i>&mdash;A trap dike was pointed out
to me by Dr. Fleming, in the parish of Flisk, in the northern part
of the county of Fife, which cuts through the grey sandstone and
shale, forming the lowest part of the Old Red Sandstone, but which
may probably be of carboniferous date. It may be traced for many
miles, passing through the amygdaloidal and other traps of the hill
called Norman&rsquo;s Law in that parish. In its course it affords
a good exemplification of the passage from the trappean into the
Plutonic, or highly crystalline texture. Professor Gustavus Rose,
to whom I submitted specimens of this dike, found it to be
dolerite, and composed of greenish black augite and Labrador
feldspar, the latter being the most abundant ingredient. A small
quantity of magnetic iron, perhaps titaniferous, is also present.
The result of this analysis is interesting, because both the
ancient and modern lavas of Etna consist in like manner of augite,
Labradorite, and titaniferous iron.</p>

<p><i>Erect Trees buried in Volcanic Ash at Arran.</i>&mdash;An
interesting discovery was made in 1867 by Mr. E. A. W&uuml;nsch in
the carboniferous strata of the north-eastern part of the island of
Arran. In the sea-cliff about five miles north of Corrie, near the
village of Laggan, strata of volcanic ash occur, forming a solid
rock cemented by carbonate of lime and enveloping trunks of trees,
determined by Mr. Binney to belong to the genera Sigillaria and
Lepidodendron. Some of these trees are at right angles to the
planes of stratification, while others are prostrate and
accompanied by leaves and fruits of the same genera. I visited the
spot in company with Mr. W&uuml;nsch in 1870, and saw that the
trees with their roots, of which about fourteen had been observed,
occur at two distinct levels in volcanic tuffs parallel to each
other, and inclined at an angle of about 40&deg;, having between
them beds of shale and coaly matter seven feet thick. It is evident
that the trees were overwhelmed by a shower of ashes from some
neighbouring volcanic vent, as Pompeii was buried by matter ejected
from Vesuvius. The trunks, several of them from three to five feet
in circumference, remained with their Stigmarian roots spreading
through the stratum below, which had served as a soil. The trees
must have continued for</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 547">[ 547 ]</a></p>

<p>years in an upright position after they were killed by the
shower of burning ashes, giving time for a partial decay of the
interior, so as to afford hollow cylinders into which the spores of
plants were wafted. These spores germinated and grew, until finally
their stems were petrified by carbonate of lime like some of the
remaining portions of the wood of the containing Sigillaria. Mr.
Carruthers has discovered that sometimes the plants which had thus
grown and become fossil in the inside of a single trunk belonged to
several distinct genera. The fact that the tree-bearing deposits
now dip at an angle of 40&deg; is the more striking, as they must
clearly have remained horizontal and undisturbed during a long
period of intermittent and contemporaneous volcanic action.</p>

<p>In some of the associated carboniferous shales, ferns and
calamites occur, and all the phenomena of the successive buried
forests remind us of the sections in <a href="ch23.html#page 410">
pp. 410 and 411</a> of the Nova Scotia coal-measures, with this
difference only, that in the case of the South Joggins the
fossilisation of the trees was effected without the eruption of
volcanic matter.</p>

<p><b>Trap of the Old Red Sandstone Period.</b>&mdash;By referring
to the section explanatory of the structure of Forfarshire, already
given (<a href="ch5.html#page 74">p. 74</a>), the reader will
perceive that beds of conglomerate, No. 3, occur in the middle of
the Old Red Sandstone system, 1, 2, 3, 4. The pebbles in these
conglomerates are sometimes composed of granitic and quartzose
rocks, sometimes exclusively of different varieties of trap, which
last, although purposely omitted in the section referred to, is
often found either intruding itself in amorphous masses and dikes
into the old fossiliferous tilestones, No. 4, or alternating with
them in conformable beds. All the different divisions of the red
sandstone, 1, 2, 3, 4, are occasionally intersected by dikes, but
they are very rare in Nos. 1 and 2, the upper members of the group
consisting of red shale and red sandstone. These phenomena, which
occur at the foot of the Grampians, are repeated in the Sidlaw
Hills; and it appears that in this part of Scotland volcanic
eruptions were most frequent in the earlier part of the Old Red
Sandstone period. The trap-rocks alluded to consist chiefly of
feldspathic porphyry and amygdaloid, the kernels of the latter
being sometimes calcareous, often chalcedonic, and forming
beautiful agates. We meet also with claystone, greenstone, compact
feldspar, and tuff. Some of these rocks look as if they had flowed
as lavas over the bottom of the sea, and enveloped quartz pebbles
which were lying there, so as to form conglomerates with a base of
greenstone, as is seen in Lumley Den, in the Sidlaw Hills. On
either side of the axis of this chain of hills</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 548">[ 548 ]</a></p>

<p>(see <a href="images/fig55.jpg">Fig. 55</a>), the beds of
massive trap, and the tuffs composed of volcanic sand and ashes,
dip regularly to the south-east or north-west, conformably with the
shales and sandstones.</p>

<p>But the geological structure of the Pentland Hills, near
Edinburgh, shows that igneous rocks were there formed during the
newer part of the Devonian or &ldquo;Old Red&rdquo; period. These
hills are 1900 feet high above the sea, and consist of
conglomerates and sandstones of Upper Devonian age, resting on the
inclined edges of grits and slates of Lower Devonian and Upper
Silurian date. The contemporaneous volcanic rocks intercalated in
this Upper Old Red consist of feldspathic lavas, or feldstones,
with associated tuffs or ashy beds. The lavas were some of them
originally compact, others vesicular, and these last have been
converted into amygdaloids. They consist chiefly of feldstone or
compact feldspar. The Pentland Hills, say Messrs. Maclaren and
Geikie, afford evidence that at the time of the Upper Old Red
Sandstone, the district to the south-west of Edinburgh was for a
long while the seat of a powerful volcano, which sent out massive
streams of lava and showers of ash, and continued active until
well-nigh the dawn of the Carboniferous period.*</p>

<p><b>Silurian Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;It appears from the
investigations of Sir R. Murchison in Shropshire, that when the
Lower Silurian strata of that country were accumulating, there were
frequent volcanic eruptions beneath the sea; and the ashes and
scori&aelig; then ejected gave rise to a peculiar kind of tufaceous
sandstone or grit, dissimilar to the other rocks of the Silurian
series, and only observable in places where syenitic and other
trap-rocks protrude. These tuffs occur on the flanks of the Wrekin
and Caer Caradoc, and contain Silurian fossils, such as casts of
encrinites, trilobites, and mollusca. Although fossiliferous, the
stone resembles a sandy claystone of the trap family.&dagger;</p>

<p>Thin layers of trap, only a few inches thick, alternate in some
parts of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire with sedimentary strata of
the Lower Silurian system. This trap consists of slaty porphyry and
granular feldspar rock, the beds being traversed by joints like
those in the associated sandstone, limestone, and shale, and having
the same strike and dip.&Dagger;</p>

<p>In Radnorshire there is an example of twelve bands of stratified
trap, alternating with Silurian schists and flagstones,</p>

<p>in a thickness of 350 feet. The bedded traps consist of feldspar
porphyry, and other varieties; and the interposed Llandeilo flags
are of sandstone and shale, with trilobites and graptolites.*</p>

<p>The Snowdonian hills in Carnarvonshire consist in great part of
volcanic tuffs, the oldest of which are interstratified with the
Bala and Llandeilo beds. There are some contemporaneous feldspathic
lavas of this era, which, says Professor Ramsay, alter the slates
on which they repose, having doubtless been poured out over them,
in a melted state, whereas the slates which overlie them having
been subsequently deposited after the lava had cooled and
consolidated, have entirely escaped alteration. But there are
greenstones associated with the same formation, which, although
they are often conformable to the slates, are in reality intrusive
rocks. They alter the stratified deposits both above and below
them, and when traced to great distances are sometimes seen to cut
through the slates, and to send off branches. Nevertheless, these
greenstones appear to belong, like the lavas, to the Lower Silurian
period.</p>

<p><b>Cambrian Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The Lingula beds in North
Wales have been described as 5000 feet in thickness. In the upper
portion of these deposits volcanic tuffs or ashy materials are
interstratified with ordinary muddy sediment, and here and there
associated with thick beds of feldspathic lava. These rocks form
the mountains called the Arans and the Arenigs; numerous
greenstones are associated with them, which are intrusive, although
they often run in the lines of bedding for a space. &ldquo;Much of
the ash,&rdquo; says Professor Ramsay, &ldquo;seems to have been
suba&euml;rial. Islands, like Graham&rsquo;s Island, may have
sometimes raised their craters for various periods above the water,
and by the waste of such islands some of the ashy matter became
waterworn, whence the ashy conglomerate. Viscous matter seems also
to have been shot into the air as volcanic bombs, which fell among
the dust and broken crystals (that often form the ashes) before
perfect cooling and consolidation had taken
place.&rdquo;&dagger;</p>

<p><b>Laurentian Volcanic Rocks.</b>&mdash;The Laurentian rocks in
Canada, especially in Ottawa and Argenteuil, are the oldest
intrusive masses yet known. They form a set of dikes of a
fine-grained dark greenstone or dolerite, composed of feldspar and
pyroxene, with occasional scales of mica and grains of pyrites.
Their width varies from a few feet to a hundred yards, and they
have a columnar structure, the columns</p>

<p class="fnote">* Murchison, Silurian System, etc., p. 325.<br>

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 550">[ 550 ]</a></p>

<p>being truly at right angles to the plane of the dike. Some of
the dikes send off branches. These dolerites are cut through by
intrusive syenite, and this syenite, in its turn, is again cut and
penetrated by feldspar porphyry, the base of which consists of
petrosilex, or a mixture of orthoclase and quartz. All these
trap-rocks appear to be of Laurentian date, as the Cambrian and
Huronian rocks rest unconformably upon them.* Whether some of the
various conformable crystalline rocks of the Laurentian series,
such as the coarse-grained granitoid and porphyritic varieties of
gneiss, exhibiting scarcely any signs of stratification, and some
of the serpentines, may not also be of volcanic origin, is a point
very difficult to determine in a region which has undergone so much
metamorphic action.</p>
